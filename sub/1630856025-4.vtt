00:13.581 --> 00:14.848
You up for the task?

00:14.948 --> 00:16.216
I wouldn't be sitting here

00:16.317 --> 00:18.186
in my Sunday best if I wasn't.

[Parker]
Well, let's make it official.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.890
[Garrett]
Billy Crow. Wanted in connection

00:22.990 --> 00:24.825
with a stagecoach robbery.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.528
I can help you with that,
Deputy Reeves.

00:28.529 --> 00:29.563
You Billy Crow?

00:35.803 --> 00:38.972
I know where they hid the money
they took from that stagecoach.

00:39.073 --> 00:40.874
We might investigate this, Bass.

00:40.974 --> 00:42.009
No.

00:42.110 --> 00:43.411
I ain't asking.

00:43.511 --> 00:45.246
You gonna shoot me?

00:45.346 --> 00:46.447
No.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.149
But they will.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.721
[Billy]
Thank you, Deputy.

00:53.821 --> 00:56.790
Make it out of here,
how do I get to do what you do?

00:56.890 --> 00:58.559
[Bass]
About that Billy Crow,

00:58.659 --> 00:59.760
he not a bad soul.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.629
Just confused.

But there you go,
looking just like trouble.

02:14.067 --> 02:17.171
That's a pretty fire-
on-the-mountain you got there.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.839
Pretty as I've seen.

02:18.939 --> 02:21.875
Bet you wanted for killing.

02:22.843 --> 02:26.046
No, ma'am. Nothing so bold.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.048
Just introducing.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.651
Introducing what?

02:30.751 --> 02:33.821
-Whiskey.
-Well, that ain't no sin.

02:33.921 --> 02:37.991
Lord knows I say howdy
three times a day myself.

02:38.091 --> 02:39.827
[chuckles]

02:39.927 --> 02:44.198
Don't see many friendly faces
up this way.

02:44.298 --> 02:46.300
Not looking to see any.

02:47.235 --> 02:49.537
Ain't as friendly
as I used to be, either.

02:49.637 --> 02:52.105
No shame in taking care.

02:52.206 --> 02:55.409
And I see you take plenty
good care all on your own.

02:56.577 --> 02:59.579
Those who are gracious
to the poor lend to the Lord.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.216
And the Lord
will fully repay them.

03:03.484 --> 03:05.453
You know God's works

03:05.553 --> 03:07.388
and His Good Book, too?

03:07.488 --> 03:09.723
Can't read a word.

03:09.823 --> 03:13.661
Never learned to,
but know it all by heart.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.676
That your boys there?

03:29.610 --> 03:31.612
Devil's own, more like it.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.682
[sighs]
Good Lord knows I tried, though.

03:34.781 --> 03:37.184
Still can't
harden my heart to 'em,

03:37.285 --> 03:38.986
even when they break it.

03:39.086 --> 03:42.323
Thought I spied a creek
snaking by.

03:42.423 --> 03:43.857
Yonder down bottom.

03:43.957 --> 03:46.860
-Hog wallow, mostly.
-Hmm.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.563
Didn't see any razorbacks
up this way.

03:49.663 --> 03:52.566
Mm. 'Cause they so wily.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.134
Little like those Indians.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.438
You see any of them either,
Mr. Joe Gamble?

03:57.538 --> 03:58.872
No, ma'am.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.641
There you go, then.

04:02.209 --> 04:04.645
See to that crick
and haul me back a bucket.

04:04.745 --> 04:08.716
I might see to rustling us up
something proper.

04:08.816 --> 04:11.051

Oh, stop all this

05:00.334 --> 05:02.670
I done told you,
this here's Joseph.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.171
Joe Gamble.
He knows the Good Book

05:04.271 --> 05:07.341
and done more chores today
than either of you.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.009

Don't be profane
under this roof.

or beg from white folk.

'em back without a scratch.

Old Mr. Sundown.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.938
Now, he was a slave catcher.

He sired some whelps
on these three Kongo sisters

15:13.813 --> 15:15.715
So?

15:15.815 --> 15:18.218
He cooked and ate 'em up.

15:21.454 --> 15:25.325
It's said he roam
the dark even now.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.929
Finding fresh slaves.

15:31.498 --> 15:35.935
Some say he building
a plantation with skin and bone.

15:36.036 --> 15:39.906
A dark, dark church,

15:40.007 --> 15:42.875
full of hell's music.

15:45.212 --> 15:48.181
* He ride by night *

-That's enough.

16:01.428 --> 16:03.130
Enough.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.868
Billy, read him a verse.

16:08.968 --> 16:12.039
Leviticus 26:6.

16:14.241 --> 16:16.909
"I will give peace in the land,
and you shall lie down

16:17.010 --> 16:18.778
and none will make you afraid.

16:18.878 --> 16:21.514
I will rid the land
of evil beasts,

16:21.614 --> 16:24.317
and the sword will not
go through your land.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.953
You will chase your enemies,
and they shall 'fail'

16:27.054 --> 16:29.622
by the sword before you."

16:30.590 --> 16:32.159
Bass!
[panting]

16:34.027 --> 16:35.762
You okay?

16:35.862 --> 16:37.864
Mm.

16:37.964 --> 16:39.199

16:39.299 --> 16:43.170
Yes, love. Just a fright.

16:43.970 --> 16:45.872
[exhales]

16:45.972 --> 16:48.408
Nights get so quiet out here.

Bass!

18:09.256 --> 18:11.358
Come see what else he done.

18:18.665 --> 18:21.201
[Tate]
Goddamn.

18:25.272 --> 18:27.307
Should've shut him up
sooner, Bass.

18:27.407 --> 18:30.743
You gonna tell me you locked
him up tight like I told you?

18:30.843 --> 18:33.146
Like I always tell you?

18:34.647 --> 18:38.151
And you gonna tell me that your
old Mr. Sundown did this thing?

18:38.251 --> 18:40.753
[chuckles]
Oh, no, Deputy.

18:40.853 --> 18:42.155
I done it.

18:42.255 --> 18:45.358
And you know it.
[laughs]

18:45.458 --> 18:49.562
I felt your beating heart,
and you felt mine.

18:49.662 --> 18:52.832
Can I kill
this crazy old fool, Bass?

18:52.932 --> 18:54.133
-[laughs]
-He's a goddamn blight.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.303
You ain't no law here.

18:58.271 --> 18:59.672
This here's hell.

19:00.707 --> 19:03.643
Until God say otherwise,

19:03.743 --> 19:05.912
I'm the only law there is.

Set to grab a few more
for Parker

20:18.985 --> 20:21.288
and then clear out
before the cold set in.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.956
It's already cold.

20:25.525 --> 20:28.060
Long days?

20:28.160 --> 20:30.730
Too long.

20:30.830 --> 20:33.533
Ready to ride for home.

20:33.633 --> 20:36.135
Got anything for me?

20:39.606 --> 20:41.240
Day back,

20:41.341 --> 20:45.077
saw a white man guiding
two Paints and a palomino,

20:45.177 --> 20:48.281
west to Checotah.

20:48.381 --> 20:51.384
Small eyes, bigger mouth.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.820
Silas Cobb.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.988
Fancy hisself a horse trader.

20:56.088 --> 20:59.459
Not even a white man's
law against that.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.861
It is when the...

21:01.961 --> 21:05.665
horses you're fixing to trade
are stolen.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.266
[chuckles]

21:08.835 --> 21:11.771
Need more rifles?

21:11.871 --> 21:16.075
I need a week off this horse
and my own bed.

21:16.175 --> 21:20.212
Figure I sweet-talk Cobb
into a pair of cuffs.

21:20.313 --> 21:22.214
[laughs softly]

21:22.315 --> 21:24.684
Don't talk long.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.320
I saw your name staked out
on the Dead Line.

21:28.321 --> 21:29.856
Big bounty.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.191

21:48.575 --> 21:50.477

Keep an eye on something
that ain't got a dress on.

22:55.074 --> 22:58.578
We done paid
our taxes twice over.

22:58.678 --> 23:00.747

about me in those pages one day.

Heck, might even
pen them myself.

23:44.991 --> 23:47.126
Is that so?

23:48.461 --> 23:49.662
Gonna waste ink on a man

Huh.

23:58.137 --> 23:59.972
[Billy clears throat]

24:05.978 --> 24:08.615
I said I was looking
for Silas Cobb.

24:08.715 --> 24:11.183
Said I don't know such.

24:11.283 --> 24:14.587
And we're not so particular
on names.

24:14.687 --> 24:17.156
You know everybody.

have to be alone.

Don't raise a fuss,
and we'll be saddled up

these folk in peace.

Least you're known to be
a reasonable Black bastard.

25:48.347 --> 25:50.516
but hard is just fine.

25:52.619 --> 25:54.353
Don't.

25:55.187 --> 25:57.223
Won't say it again.

I'm afraid you got
the upper hand, as it were.

26:04.163 --> 26:06.565
I'm not pigeon-livered.

26:06.666 --> 26:09.535
But how about we make
a deal here anyway?

26:09.636 --> 26:11.804
An easy arrangement?

26:11.904 --> 26:13.906
Say I trade you a real outlaw,

Jim Webb.

crossed a path or two.

What do you know about it?

26:39.666 --> 26:43.369
[sighs] Got an eight-inch
barrel, .44-caliber cartridge.

26:43.469 --> 26:45.705
Loaded up,
weighs three pounds heavy,

26:45.805 --> 26:48.540
and you best account for it
if you draw fast.

26:48.641 --> 26:50.176
Aim a bit high, I'd say.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.411
Either way,
it bucks like a bronco

26:52.511 --> 26:55.147
and is only good
for a hundred steps.

26:55.247 --> 26:58.617
Beyond, you better switch
to a rifle.

26:58.718 --> 27:00.119
Or pray.

27:00.219 --> 27:01.821
[laughs softly]

You learn all that in there?

27:05.624 --> 27:07.359
In there.

Out here, I'm hoping
for some peace and quiet.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.417
one for the house
and one for me.

27:31.517 --> 27:34.821
Three bits, and you can
call me any name you want.

how it ends?

27:52.438 --> 27:54.640

I done told you all.

We had a deal, fair and square.

28:18.597 --> 28:20.332
Our deal was,
I wouldn't shoot you

28:20.432 --> 28:22.634
and I'd tell Parker you sang.

28:22.735 --> 28:24.336
Where's my deal, Deputy?

Don't rain on me

or taking.

32:18.304 --> 32:20.806

the choice

could you know about it?

32:43.996 --> 32:45.897
Want to get us paid or not?

33:08.920 --> 33:09.855
[Edwin]
Is it true

33:09.955 --> 33:11.657
he speaks Native as good as any?

33:11.757 --> 33:13.659
That he makes his arrests
out in the Bad Lands,

33:13.759 --> 33:15.261
deep in the Territory?

33:15.361 --> 33:17.529
Places no one else will go.

33:17.629 --> 33:19.998
Men no one else
wants to trifle with.

33:20.099 --> 33:23.235
It doesn't seem to bother him
much, and neither do those men.

33:23.335 --> 33:27.106
How many has he sent
to their Heavenly Reward?

33:30.042 --> 33:32.678
Bass would say one is too many.

33:32.778 --> 33:36.815
Tell Jennie about our plans
for Indian Territory.

33:36.915 --> 33:38.750
The townships.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.086
Paradise?

33:40.186 --> 33:42.754
A poetic turn of phrase.

33:42.854 --> 33:45.257
But sadly, as you once told me,

33:45.357 --> 33:48.560
there is no paradise,
no Zion over the next hill.

33:48.660 --> 33:52.598
If we want it,
we will have to build it.

33:52.698 --> 33:57.002
Choctaw, Seminole and the rest
might have a say.

33:57.803 --> 33:58.970
[sighs]

33:59.071 --> 34:01.640
I do want to believe it,
though. I do.

34:01.740 --> 34:05.311
But pretty pamphlets and flowery
phrases don't plow fields.

34:05.411 --> 34:08.380
And they sure don't
hammer nails.

34:08.480 --> 34:11.283
Most days, I can't keep a fence
from falling at that farm.

34:11.382 --> 34:14.420
[laughs softly]
You are forthright.

34:14.520 --> 34:16.822
But I'm not making
idle promises.

34:16.922 --> 34:19.190
I am not selling fool's gold.

34:19.291 --> 34:20.992
What I am proposing

34:21.092 --> 34:24.630
will require work and sweat,

34:24.730 --> 34:26.465
blood and treasure.

34:44.716 --> 34:47.686
* slow, somber music *

34:47.786 --> 34:50.188
***

35:06.605 --> 35:10.008
You killed him dead,
or Bass done it?

35:11.843 --> 35:14.646
Finally got blood on your hands

35:14.746 --> 35:16.748
and a haint
hiding in your heart.

35:16.848 --> 35:20.352
You ain't sleeping sound
no more.

35:20.452 --> 35:22.221
[laughs]

35:26.258 --> 35:28.660
Oh, there he go.

35:30.762 --> 35:32.030
[chuckles]

35:32.130 --> 35:34.900
How bad a good man
got to be, Billy Crow?

35:35.000 --> 35:36.202
How bad?

35:36.302 --> 35:38.970
Better to kill a man
and live with that,

35:39.070 --> 35:42.073
than give ole Mr. Sundown
his blood due.

35:43.309 --> 35:45.211
Better that, Billy Crow.

35:45.311 --> 35:47.646
Better that.

35:47.746 --> 35:49.881
[cackles]

35:49.981 --> 35:52.017
Billy the Killer Crow!

35:52.117 --> 35:54.886
You can kiss them
peaceful nights goodbye, boy.

35:54.986 --> 35:57.789
-Billy the Killer Crow!
-Put them hands up.

35:57.889 --> 35:59.625
I see it in your eyes.

36:01.693 --> 36:03.595
* tense, dramatic music *

36:03.695 --> 36:05.931
***

36:22.514 --> 36:24.416
* slow, somber music *

36:24.516 --> 36:26.752
***

36:31.857 --> 36:33.725
Evening, ma'am.

36:33.825 --> 36:35.060
[Grace]
Oh.

36:35.160 --> 36:37.929
I heard you and your horse
both a ways off.

36:38.029 --> 36:42.534
Even the quiet carries
clear and far out here,

36:42.634 --> 36:44.636
just like church bells.

36:45.604 --> 36:47.873
You come with word on Silas?

36:48.774 --> 36:50.376
Yes, ma'am.

36:50.476 --> 36:52.944
I take it he's dead, then?

36:54.680 --> 36:56.982
-Sorry to say.
-And I take it

36:57.082 --> 36:59.951
he died in the company
of a woman?

37:01.553 --> 37:06.358
They did seem... familiar.

37:07.158 --> 37:09.695
So, you the man that done him?

37:09.795 --> 37:12.230
Bad deal all around.

37:13.999 --> 37:17.102
My debt is this letter.

37:18.036 --> 37:20.406
Silas's last words to you.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.742
That's right kind, but...

37:23.842 --> 37:26.412
kind of sad, too,
don't you think?

37:26.512 --> 37:30.682
Silas eager to tell me things
he'd never say when he was here.

37:30.782 --> 37:33.719
Not that he was here
overly much.

37:35.487 --> 37:38.056
Hard on a household.

37:39.825 --> 37:41.393
I know.

37:43.762 --> 37:46.698
Let me get something nice
for your horse.

38:01.246 --> 38:02.814
Thank you.

38:02.914 --> 38:04.483
You best read that letter quick.

38:04.583 --> 38:08.720
They say ole Sundown rides
on nights like these.

38:22.133 --> 38:24.235
* slow, somber music *

38:24.336 --> 38:26.372
***

38:30.008 --> 38:33.244
This thing out here...

38:35.013 --> 38:40.118
...been so, so hard.

38:43.254 --> 38:46.925
God didn't give me the tongue
to tell it well.

38:47.759 --> 38:50.596
[playing inaudibly]

38:50.696 --> 38:53.932
But at least He gave me you.

38:56.868 --> 38:59.004
My heart...

38:59.104 --> 39:01.940
hurt when we apart.

39:04.943 --> 39:08.079
Only stars to guide me home.

39:09.848 --> 39:12.083
Guide me to you.

39:15.821 --> 39:18.056
[crying softly]

39:35.807 --> 39:38.043
***

39:54.392 --> 39:56.127
[nearby crunch]

40:07.439 --> 40:09.541

40:09.641 --> 40:11.877
***

40:19.485 --> 40:21.520
***

40:37.803 --> 40:39.738
You wonder why your children
don't recognize you anymore?

40:39.838 --> 40:41.840
I have a duty.
Swore an oath.

40:41.940 --> 40:45.477
[Sherrill] You are to deliver
the prisoner Jackson Cole

40:45.577 --> 40:47.012
to the Red River,

40:47.112 --> 40:48.747
and turn him over
to the Rangers.

40:49.615 --> 40:51.783
You ride out tomorrow.

40:51.883 --> 40:55.120
-[horse whinnies]
-[thunder crackling]

40:55.220 --> 40:57.923
Black folks been disappearing
up and down the Territory.

40:58.023 --> 41:01.292
Bring to mind all
the aggravated horrors

41:01.392 --> 41:04.596
and may God have mercy on you.

41:05.864 --> 41:10.502
* slow, dramatic music *
