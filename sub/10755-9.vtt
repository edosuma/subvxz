00:09.761 --> 00:11.517
Ah, Niles.
Hello.

00:11.517 --> 00:15.844
Is it just me, or are the sidewalk Santas getting pushy?

00:15.844 --> 00:21.739
Well, tomorrow is Christmas.  I suppose they might be expecting a little downturn after that.

00:21.739 --> 00:24.188
Cappuccino, please.

00:24.188 --> 00:27.280
So?  When does Frederick arrive?

00:27.280 --> 00:30.868
In six hours and twenty-one minutes.  Not that I'm the least bit excited.

00:30.868 --> 00:32.394
Yes, I'm sure he's excited too.

00:32.394 --> 00:34.121
First Christmas at daddy's.

00:34.121 --> 00:36.721
I imagine he has visions of sugarplums dancing through his head.

00:36.721 --> 00:42.499
No, Lilith doesn't allow sweets, he's probably got visions of bran.

00:42.499 --> 00:45.702
Well, I've got my own reasons to celebrate.

00:45.702 --> 00:48.522
Maris and I may be together again, by the new year.

00:48.522 --> 00:49.803
Oh, really Niles?
Yep, yeah.

00:49.803 --> 00:52.938
I called this morning to arrange the delivery of her Christmas gift,

00:52.938 --> 00:57.616
and she said the only gift she'd accept from me was an abject apology.

00:57.616 --> 00:59.077
Going to cave into her, aren't you?

00:59.077 --> 01:07.464
Au contraire.  I told her I was not about to apologise,
and from that point on, the respect in her voice came through loud and clear.

01:07.464 --> 01:14.146
No small feat, considering at the time she was speaking at the time through the hole in her massage table.

01:14.146 --> 01:14.858
Oh, hi Roz.

01:14.858 --> 01:20.664
Hey. Double espresso, please.  This last-minute Christmas shopping is killing me.

01:20.664 --> 01:22.661
I never know what to give the men in my life.

01:22.661 --> 01:26.445
Since when?

01:26.445 --> 01:28.569
Ha, ha.  Funny man.

01:28.569 --> 01:30.176
Excuse me, I'll take care of this.

01:30.176 --> 01:31.759
Oh, thank you Niles.

01:31.759 --> 01:34.994
What's new, Niles?

01:34.994 --> 01:39.983
I have been keeping it under wraps but, Maris and I have separated.

01:39.983 --> 01:44.731
Oh, my God!  I had no idea.  I can't believe no-one told me.

01:44.731 --> 01:49.430
This is such a surprise!
That's enough, Talulah.

01:49.430 --> 01:52.062
You're not fooling anyone.

01:52.062 --> 01:54.777
I'm sorry sir, your card didn't clear.

01:54.777 --> 01:56.360
I have to do this.

01:56.360 --> 01:59.237
Wait, wait!  What are you doing?

01:59.237 --> 02:04.272
The computer said "credit cancelled by order of co-signatory."

02:04.272 --> 02:06.414
Maris has cancelled your credit card.

02:06.414 --> 02:09.744
Whoa, Merry Christmas!

02:09.744 --> 02:11.108
Would you care to use a different one?

02:11.108 --> 02:14.245
There's no point, they're all in her name.

02:14.245 --> 02:17.151
I'm calling her right now and demanding the restoration of my credit card.

02:17.151 --> 02:19.088
And my bank accounts.

02:19.088 --> 02:23.237
And my phone service!

02:25.759 --> 02:29.660
Doc, I'm at the airport, and I'm having a lot of trouble getting on the plane.

02:29.660 --> 02:33.471
Now Bob, statistics prove that we're safer in the air than on the ground.

02:33.471 --> 02:40.612
That-that's not it.  I'm supposed to be flying home to Newark for Christmas,
but the flight the next gate over has a flight to Maui.

02:40.612 --> 02:44.538
I'm telling you, it's calling me, Doc.

02:44.538 --> 02:47.262
Why are you hesitant to go home?

02:47.262 --> 02:49.429
Because it's the same thing every year.

02:49.429 --> 02:53.048
I travel three thousand miles to sit down at the dinner table with my family,

02:53.048 --> 02:54.938
and what do we talk about?

02:54.938 --> 02:56.931
What's going on in out lives?  No.

02:56.931 --> 02:58.966
Our hopes and dreams?  No.

02:58.966 --> 03:00.913
We talk about the turkey.

03:00.913 --> 03:04.096
"Boy, that's quite a bird."
"Twenty-four pounder."

03:04.096 --> 03:07.611
"What time did you have to get up to put that in the oven,  Ange?"

03:07.611 --> 03:12.218
"Oh boy, that's moist.  You must have been basting that bird all day."

03:12.218 --> 03:14.683
"Are those walnuts in the stuffing?"

03:14.683 --> 03:18.554
"Oh god, I forgot to put the rolls in the oven."

03:18.554 --> 03:24.762
I guess what I'm trying to say, Bob, is that we're all in the same gravy boat.

03:24.762 --> 03:29.137
But you see, the important thing is that we spend time with our loved ones.

03:29.137 --> 03:34.796
Just think how you'd feel if you woke up tomorrow morning six thousand miles away from your home.

03:34.796 --> 03:38.104
Well, I tell ya, that really puts it in perspective, doc.

03:38.104 --> 03:39.428
I got a plane to catch.

03:39.428 --> 03:44.727
Mele Keleke Maka, Bob.

03:44.727 --> 03:49.022
We'll be right back after these messages.

03:49.022 --> 03:50.267
Oh, Roz.  What did they say, what did they say?

03:50.267 --> 03:54.625
Oh, relax.  Frederick's flight is still on time, he'll be here in less than three hours.

03:54.625 --> 03:57.001
Oh, and the florist called, you can pick up your wreath on the way home.

03:57.001 --> 04:03.273
Oh, fabulous.  You know, every year Dad puts that kitschy creature with the lightbulb nose on the door.

04:03.273 --> 04:05.081
Hey, great party.

04:05.081 --> 04:08.240
Best one ever, thanks to me.  I hired a stripper!

04:08.240 --> 04:12.358
Doc, you will never guess what her name is

04:12.358 --> 04:15.833
Candy Kane.

04:15.833 --> 04:19.942
What are the odds?

04:19.942 --> 04:25.227
For those of you who have not yet sampled the punch,
here is my capsule review:

04:25.227 --> 04:34.009
vile bouquet, unwholesome colour, ghastly taste - and a kick that is simply heaven.

04:34.009 --> 04:35.644
OK, 30 seconds,  
Out!

04:35.644 --> 04:37.266
All right people, out, out, please.

04:37.266 --> 04:39.927
Hey, Roz.  You know what's over my head?

04:39.927 --> 04:43.757
Almost any clever remark?

04:43.757 --> 04:46.483
What's she mean by that?

04:46.483 --> 04:49.090
Oh, listen Roz.

04:49.090 --> 04:52.703
I know you've got a plane to catch and the traffic to the airport is probably very bad,

04:52.703 --> 04:55.257
so in the spirit of the Christmas season,

04:55.257 --> 04:57.119
why don't you just take off early, hmm?

04:57.119 --> 05:00.788
You're going to read one of your inspirational Christmas fables again, aren't you?

05:00.788 --> 05:05.579
Yes, I am.  Be a lot easier without you sitting over there sticking your finger in your throat.

05:05.579 --> 05:06.803
Right.  Merry Christmas.

05:06.803 --> 05:08.057
Merry Christmas, Roz.

05:08.057 --> 05:08.709
Say "Hi" to Frederick.

05:08.709 --> 05:12.403
Yes, and say "Hi" to your mom for me.
Will do.

05:12.403 --> 05:16.433
Hi, we're back.  As most of my faithful listeners know,

05:16.433 --> 05:25.778
every year I compose a parable that I hope will illuminate the spirit of the Christmas season.

05:28.763 --> 05:38.689
So without any further ado, I give you "The Story of Olaf, the lonely little goatherd."

05:42.911 --> 05:48.068
"Once upon a time, there lived a lonely little goatherd.

05:48.068 --> 05:57.759
He had no family, and no playthings, so to amuse himself, one day he carved a little wooden flute."

05:57.759 --> 06:02.556
"A flute that he used to play during the long, lonely evenings.

06:02.556 --> 06:08.627
And the tune it made was very lovely, and all the people in the village below could hear the pure, glorious sound..."

06:08.627 --> 06:17.348
This is all very amusing, but nothing you can do is going to distract me!

06:17.348 --> 06:27.669
"One day, the son of a wealthy merchant heard the music,
and while that boy had all the toys in the world, he was jealous of this little goatherd's flute."

06:27.669 --> 06:33.899
"So one dark- night, one dark-  -windy night..."

06:33.899 --> 06:39.288
"The merchant's son stole his precious instrument, but when he took that flute home,

06:39.288 --> 06:43.333
he couldn't make it play.  So he smashed the flute to bits."

06:43.333 --> 06:49.351
"When the little goatherd came down the mountain the next day, and saw his flute was broken..."

06:49.351 --> 06:53.053
YIKES!

06:53.053 --> 06:54.891
"He might have said that..."

06:54.891 --> 06:57.890
"But instead he forgave the merchant's son.

06:57.890 --> 07:01.476
And the wealthy merchant adopted the little goatherd, and..."

07:01.476 --> 07:05.317
OH, MAMA! ?"

07:05.317 --> 07:13.834
he said, upon meeting the merchant's wife...
"And somewhere along the way, he learned the true meaning of Christmas."

07:13.834 --> 07:20.371
This is Dr. Frasier Crane, wishing you a truly blessed and forgiving holiday.

07:20.371 --> 07:25.643
There now, you see?  Nice try.  Miss Kane's delightful performance aside,

07:25.643 --> 07:30.211
this just proves the power of my message cannot be stayed.

07:30.211 --> 07:33.686
Oh for God's sakes, what am I, a robot?

07:38.085 --> 07:41.497
And to all a good night.

07:44.412 --> 07:46.954
IF I ONLY HAD A BRAIN

07:54.101 --> 07:58.138
Hi, Dad.  Ah,

07:58.138 --> 08:00.190
I'm going to put this wreath up here.

08:00.190 --> 08:01.288
What's the matter with Rudolph?

08:01.288 --> 08:06.100
Well Dad, you know, I just think that Christmas decorations should be understated and tasteful.

08:06.100 --> 08:09.941
Boy, I can't get one thing that I want.

08:09.941 --> 08:15.215
Dad, I'm sorry, but if I gave you one thing, God knows where it might lead.

08:17.000 --> 08:23.074

08:27.055 --> 08:32.351
Oh, God... it's my childhood Christmases all over again.

08:32.351 --> 08:36.663
Only now Mom isn't here to say, "Shut up, you'll hurt his feelings."

08:36.663 --> 08:40.203
Oh, don't be such a Grinch.

08:40.203 --> 08:43.390
Ho, Ho, Ho!

08:43.390 --> 08:46.544
It works when you step on the mat. 
Ho, Ho, Ho!

08:46.544 --> 08:49.698
It can say "Ho, Ho, Ho", "Merry Christmas", or "Happy Holidays."

08:49.698 --> 08:54.581
Yeah, well I hope it can say "Geronimo" because I'm going to throw him off the balcony!

08:54.581 --> 08:57.659
Well, I don't care what you think, it's not for you, it's for Frederick.

08:57.659 --> 09:02.540
God, I suppose you're right, Dad.  I used to love this stuff when I was six.

09:02.540 --> 09:05.968
By the time I was seven I started to have questions.

09:05.968 --> 09:13.569
When I was eight I started spending a lot more time at the Bernsteins.

09:13.569 --> 09:16.445
Well, I'm off to Joe's parents' house.

09:16.445 --> 09:17.796
I see you've been busy in the kitchen.

09:17.796 --> 09:21.347
Yes.  I'm bringing Grammy Moon's famous plum duff.

09:21.347 --> 09:25.398
It's a still flour pudding boiled in a cloth bag.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.317
Who gets to lick the bag?

09:28.317 --> 09:31.316
No.  You see, Grammy Moon had a secret ingredient.

09:31.316 --> 09:36.351
She'd soak it for hours in rum, then ignite it in a blinding flash.

09:36.351 --> 09:41.557
As soon as she came out of the kitchen with no eyebrows, we knew dessert was ready

09:41.557 --> 09:47.266
You know, to this day the smell of burning hair puts me in the holiday spirit.

09:47.266 --> 09:51.282
Bye, Merry Christmas. 
Merry Christmas.

09:51.282 --> 09:55.152
You know, someone's got to go back down to the storeroom, there's still something missing.

09:55.152 --> 10:01.056
You must be kidding, Dad.  My God, this place couldn't look any more ludicrous.

10:08.367 --> 10:15.162
Once I saw how those white hairs on his chin looked like a beard, the rest of the idea just fell into place.

10:17.992 --> 10:23.793
Niles.
Hello, Frasier...

10:23.793 --> 10:28.506
I know, I know - "Shut up, we'll hurt his feelings."

10:28.506 --> 10:31.463
So, Niles, did you have a discussion with Maris?

10:31.463 --> 10:34.100
No, but! - I had an epiphany.

10:34.100 --> 10:39.995
I realised, cutting off my funds is Maris's way of saying, "I love you!"

10:39.995 --> 10:46.446
She always uses money to get what she wants; ergo, this is proof she wants me back!  What do you think?

10:46.446 --> 10:51.207
Ho, Ho, Ho!

10:51.207 --> 10:55.712
I think Santa's said it all for us.

11:03.217 --> 11:08.706
Dad, you have to get out more.

11:08.706 --> 11:12.100
You've started doing old lady things.

11:12.100 --> 11:13.666
It's for Frederick!

11:13.666 --> 11:16.160
Oh, of course it is.

11:16.160 --> 11:20.260
Oh, that reminds me, I don't want to impose, but may I ride with you to the airport to pick up Frederick?

11:20.260 --> 11:24.306
Of course you may, Niles. Just have to wrap up his presents first.

11:24.306 --> 11:25.651
So what did you get Freddie?

11:25.651 --> 11:31.943
Well actually dad, I ordered him the toy catalogue, from the special section called "Gifts for the Gifted."

11:31.943 --> 11:35.907
I got him the junior astronomy set, and the geology lab

11:35.907 --> 11:38.776
oh, and a fabulous thing called the "Living Brain."

11:38.776 --> 11:43.614
You get to paint each lobe a different colour, then you stuff it inside the Living Skull.

11:43.614 --> 11:45.229
Hey, you know what kids really like?

11:45.229 --> 11:48.367
They've been advertising it like crazy on TV.  It's great.

11:48.367 --> 11:52.414
The Outlaw Laser Robo Geek.

11:52.414 --> 11:57.182
Its head lights up and it shoots death rays out of its eyes.

11:57.182 --> 12:00.554
Yeah.  A little like that.

12:02.063 --> 12:04.302
Listen Dad, I think I know what Frederick likes.

12:04.302 --> 12:05.894
He's precocious, he needs to be challenged.

12:05.894 --> 12:08.277
Oh, challenge him the other 364 days.

12:08.277 --> 12:12.036
One day out of the year, indulge him.  Let him be a kid.

12:12.036 --> 12:17.620
Dad, I'm sorry, if Frederick's anything like me, the kind of toys he'll like to play with are...

12:17.620 --> 12:22.127
A kitchen set, a dollhouse and three kinds of Barbies!

12:22.127 --> 12:26.137
This is for a Franklin Crane from Kenibunkport

12:26.137 --> 12:27.586
God, you realise what this means?!

12:27.586 --> 12:37.142
Yes.  The Cranes of Maine have got your "Living Brain."

12:38.043 --> 12:40.777
No.

12:40.777 --> 12:42.534
It means I don't have anything for Freddie.

12:42.534 --> 12:44.843
God, I wanted everything to be so perfect.

12:44.843 --> 12:46.517
Now he's going to have a horrible Christmas.

12:46.517 --> 12:49.036
listen, it's OK.  There's a big toy store in the mall.

12:49.036 --> 12:51.315
They're open late tonight.  Just don't worry about it.

12:51.315 --> 12:52.750
Well, that's easy for you to say, Dad.

12:52.750 --> 12:59.857
My God, it's Christmas Eve, the gifts I ordered are three thousand miles away,
my son is due in an hour, and on top of it all I have to go to a mall!

12:59.857 --> 13:01.798
Ho, Ho, Ho!

13:01.798 --> 13:04.557
Oh, don't look at me, he said it.

13:08.036 --> 13:11.529
A MALL AND THE NIGHT VISITORS

13:13.096 --> 13:16.814
Niles, customers are marauding through here like a pack of feral dogs.

13:16.814 --> 13:19.662
Did you see that woman?  She practically knocked me over on her way to the escalator.

13:19.662 --> 13:23.928
Well, how about that woman near the cosmetics counter who tried to mace me?

13:23.928 --> 13:28.174
That was a cologne sample, Niles.  That's what they do.

13:28.174 --> 13:31.222
Now listen, we've got five minutes.  We've got to find a sales clerk.

13:31.222 --> 13:32.575
Oh well, good luck.

13:32.575 --> 13:34.924
All right, we'd better find something ourselves, I guess.

13:34.924 --> 13:37.586
Well hey, hey.  This looks amusing.

13:37.586 --> 13:41.303
Niles, may I remind you we're looking for something educational?

13:41.303 --> 13:44.077
Oh, oh, oh, oh, it has buttons.

13:44.077 --> 13:46.681
What's it doing?

13:46.681 --> 13:47.953
It's flashing.

13:47.953 --> 13:52.680
Niles, please remember that Freddie tested in the highest percentile for cognitive skills and deductive reasoning.

13:52.680 --> 13:55.260
What's it doing now?

13:55.260 --> 14:03.340
It's beeping, for God's sake!  And as much as I'd like to inflict this on Lilith, I'm looking for fast and educational,
all right?

14:07.125 --> 14:08.388
I wonder what else it does?

14:08.388 --> 14:12.021
Let's see if it protects your head!

14:17.236 --> 14:19.721
Ooh, here's something.

14:19.721 --> 14:21.182
Look at this, look at this.

14:21.182 --> 14:21.674
Oh, God.

14:21.674 --> 14:24.321
It's called "Ecto Goo."

14:24.321 --> 14:26.322
Oh well, that sounds vaguely scientific

14:26.322 --> 14:28.590
but what could he possibly learn from that?

14:28.590 --> 14:32.291
Well, for starters, he can learn never to wear Armani to a toy store.

14:32.291 --> 14:35.747
Let's see, I'll just have to remember what I ordered from the catalogue and look for that.

14:35.747 --> 14:37.453
First, the "Living Brain."

14:37.453 --> 14:42.102
Living Brain?  What kind of dork wants that?

14:42.102 --> 14:47.944
With any luck, the kind of dork who'll be operating on your prostate someday.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.260
Frasier, Frasier, Frasier.

14:53.260 --> 14:56.448
Look, look, look, there it is.  It's up on the shelf, it's up on the shelf.
Oh, marvelous.

14:56.448 --> 14:58.773
Oh, Lord.  It's covered with dust.

14:58.773 --> 15:03.027
The brain is dusty.  Could there be a clearer metaphor?

15:03.027 --> 15:05.063
Oh, Lord.  There's nothing in it.

15:05.063 --> 15:05.890
Can I have it?

15:05.890 --> 15:06.938
It's an empty box, Ma'am.

15:06.938 --> 15:09.451
I know, but I can put my son's Robo Geek in it.

15:09.451 --> 15:14.489
You know how scared he'll be when he thinks he's getting something this nerdy?

15:14.489 --> 15:17.114
Oh God, this is hopeless.  We'll never find anything for Frederick.

15:17.114 --> 15:19.710
Oh, Frasier.  Just give him a cheque.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.868
But Niles, you can't give a cheque to a child.

15:21.868 --> 15:23.910
That's what I'm giving him.

15:23.910 --> 15:26.667
It has a stagecoach on it.

15:26.667 --> 15:29.693
Niles, Maris cancelled your account.

15:29.693 --> 15:32.002
Damn!

15:32.002 --> 15:35.589
Oh, look.  Look at that man's bag.  "Young Minds."

15:35.589 --> 15:38.365
Sir, excuse me, is this store  in the mall?

15:38.365 --> 15:39.459
Yeah.

15:39.459 --> 15:41.059
And it's educational toys?

15:41.059 --> 15:43.400
Mmm-hmm, nothing but.  It's just a couple of doors down.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.105
Yes!  Petunia, there is a Santa Claus.

15:45.105 --> 15:48.175
No, they closed a half hour ago.

15:48.175 --> 15:55.108
Damn.  Look, this is perfect, look a chemistry lab, and a picture puzzle and...

15:55.108 --> 15:58.128
You know, my son comes in, in half an hour and I've absolutely nothing for him.

15:58.128 --> 16:01.541
He'll be in, in 22 minutes if he picks up a good tailwind.

16:01.541 --> 16:03.686
You ahh, you really need this stuff bad, don't you?

16:03.686 --> 16:07.375
Oh, you have no idea, it would save my life.

16:07.375 --> 16:08.867
I'll tell you what.

16:08.867 --> 16:10.271
Seeing as how it's Christmas...

16:10.271 --> 16:11.819
Oh, God bless you, sir.

16:11.819 --> 16:15.651
A thousand bucks.

16:15.651 --> 16:18.018
What?!  A thousand bucks?

16:18.018 --> 16:19.235
Hey, take it or leave it.

16:19.235 --> 16:22.857
Well, I mean, there's just no more than a hundred dollars worth of things here.

16:22.857 --> 16:26.671
"Ladies and gentlemen, we're beginning our descent into Seattle airport."

16:26.671 --> 16:28.066
I'm just trying to do you a favour here.

16:28.066 --> 16:29.577
Well, it's some favour.

16:29.577 --> 16:31.845
"Please make sure your tables and seats are in their full and upright position."

16:31.845 --> 16:33.284
Shut up, Niles!

16:33.284 --> 16:37.621
All right, all right, lets see what I've got here.

16:37.621 --> 16:40.545
All right, I've got, ahh... Here's three hundred dollars.

16:40.545 --> 16:43.391
Would you-would you accept a personal cheque for the rest?

16:43.391 --> 16:45.426
Hey, it's Christmas.

16:45.426 --> 16:48.110
Oh, bless you, bless you so much.  Very well, thank you.

16:48.110 --> 16:52.170
Niles, give the man a cheque.

16:55.340 --> 16:56.269
Where's Freddie?

16:56.269 --> 16:59.919
Putting on his pajamas.  Told me he would come in and say goodnight after he brushes his teeth.

16:59.919 --> 17:00.993
So how'd you do?

17:00.993 --> 17:04.260
Well, I didn't get exactly what I'd ordered, but I think I did all right.

17:04.260 --> 17:09.098
I got him a microscope, a chemistry set,

17:09.098 --> 17:13.800
and a five thousand piece puzzle of the Great Wall of China.

17:13.800 --> 17:17.957
Well, maybe he'll have fun with the boxes.

17:17.957 --> 17:23.082
Dad, here you go, this is the last box from the storeroom.

17:25.146 --> 17:26.300
Now, was this what you were looking for?

17:26.300 --> 17:28.734
Oh, yeah.

17:28.734 --> 17:31.409
Santa's legs for the chimney, you remember these babies?

17:31.409 --> 17:39.298
Oh, yes.  Inspired some spectacular Christmas nightmares the year I found them under your bed.

17:39.298 --> 17:44.623
Frasier, isn't this the  smoking jacket you gave Dad a few years back?

17:44.623 --> 17:50.023
What?  Hey... How did that get in there?

17:50.023 --> 17:53.856
Dad, these are all of the gifts I've given you for the last six years.

17:53.856 --> 17:57.445
Hey, c'mon now, shut the- put 'em back.  Close the box, will ya?

17:57.445 --> 18:00.833
Dad, look at this.  My God, they're still in the original boxes, never been worn.

18:00.833 --> 18:02.074
Sure they have.

18:02.074 --> 18:04.991
Oh, yeah. This one still has the tags on it.

18:04.991 --> 18:08.142
Look, this isn't the kind of conversation we should be having on Christmas eve.

18:08.142 --> 18:12.624
No, Dad?  Well, what was it you wanted to say?

18:12.624 --> 18:19.493
Well, you know Frasier, you're always giving people things you think they should like,
instead of things that they really like.

18:19.493 --> 18:21.345
I mean, come on -

18:21.345 --> 18:25.438
In your entire life, have you ever seen me wear anything like that?

18:25.438 --> 18:28.515
Well, no.  I thought you might like a change.

18:28.515 --> 18:31.626
Well, it's like when you were a kid, remember?

18:31.626 --> 18:36.797
I wanted you to love baseball.  I wanted to get you a bat, glove, everything, for Christmas.

18:36.797 --> 18:40.700
But you had your mind set on a microscope, so that's what I got you.

18:40.700 --> 18:52.525
And then when Dad took us to a game, you spent the whole time looking for rodent hairs in your hot-dog.

18:52.525 --> 18:57.837
I'm just saying Christmas isn't the time you try to mold somebody,
which is what you're trying to do with Frederick.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.934
I think I know what's good for my own son.

18:59.934 --> 19:01.362
I brushed my teeth, Daddy.

19:01.362 --> 19:04.600
Oh, that's my boy.  Come on.

19:04.600 --> 19:08.086
Bonsoir, Uncle Niles.
Et toi aussi.

19:08.086 --> 19:09.713
Hey, you'd better get to sleep, or Santa won't come.

19:09.713 --> 19:13.242
OK.  I know just what Santa's bringing me this year, Dad.

19:13.242 --> 19:16.032
I bet you don't.

19:16.032 --> 19:22.625
Yes I do too.  It's an Outlaw Laser Robo Geek.

19:24.767 --> 19:26.485
What makes you think that?

19:26.485 --> 19:28.927
Because I asked Santa for it in my letter.

19:28.927 --> 19:32.255
They are sooo cool.

19:32.255 --> 19:35.407
Ahh, listen ahh, Frederick,

19:35.407 --> 19:38.130
there's erm... Frederick, where are you going?

19:38.130 --> 19:43.175
I'm going to make myself fall asleep right away, so the next thing I know, it'll be morning.

19:43.175 --> 19:44.220
Goodnight, Daddy.

19:44.220 --> 19:45.718
I'll come in and tuck you in, in a minute.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.510
Goodnight, Grandpa.  Goodnight, Uncle Niles.

19:47.510 --> 19:48.196
Goodnight.

19:48.196 --> 19:52.886
Goodnight, Frederick.  I'm going to go home and go to bed too.

19:52.886 --> 19:57.351
I hope Aunt Maris comes out of her coma.

20:06.967 --> 20:12.524
He asked where she was, I thought the truth would just upset him.

20:12.524 --> 20:14.391
I'll see you in the morning.  Merry Christmas.

20:14.391 --> 20:16.992
See you tomorrow.

20:17.896 --> 20:20.016
Well, this is turning out to be quite a Christmas.

20:20.016 --> 20:23.691
Oh, it's going to be fine.

20:23.691 --> 20:25.640
Done it again.

20:25.640 --> 20:28.695
Gotten everyone the wrong gifts.

20:28.695 --> 20:31.899
What is it about me?

20:31.899 --> 20:34.357
Well, here, you might as well open your gift now.

20:34.357 --> 20:36.147
No reason for everyone to be disappointed tomorrow.

20:36.147 --> 20:38.972
Hey, I'm sure I'm gonna love it.

20:38.972 --> 20:43.957
I doubt it.  Not exactly my night.

20:45.114 --> 20:49.288
Hey!  A robe!  Great, I love it!

20:49.288 --> 20:55.140
No, you don't.  It's not a robe, it's a dressing gown.

20:55.140 --> 20:57.415
Noel Coward would love it, but it's not you.

20:57.415 --> 21:00.070
Hey, I love Noel Coward!

21:00.070 --> 21:01.720
Dad, you're overcompensating.

21:01.720 --> 21:05.755
Some people are hard to buy for, I'm sorry.

21:05.755 --> 21:09.331
But, you know, you are too, I never know what to get you.

21:09.331 --> 21:11.540
Here.

21:11.540 --> 21:14.605
You might as well open this now.

21:16.224 --> 21:20.617
Yeah.  Guess it was easier when I was small.

21:20.617 --> 21:23.055
'Cause kids always know what they want, don't they?

21:23.055 --> 21:26.579
Yeah, yeah.  It's rough for adults.

21:31.277 --> 21:32.843
Oh, Dad...

21:32.843 --> 21:36.937
Merry Christmas, son.

21:36.937 --> 21:39.038
How did you know?  It's jut what I always wanted:

21:39.038 --> 21:45.779
My very own Outlaw Laser Robo Geek.

21:46.357 --> 21:50.774
Oh, Dad - oh, oh, listen, are the batteries included?

21:50.774 --> 21:54.465
In the box.
Oh, Dad!
