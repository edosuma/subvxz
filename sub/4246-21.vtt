WEBVTT

00:01.149 --> 00:03.282
The President considers
these allegations

00:03.350 --> 00:06.151
to be a private matter between
himself and the First Lady.

00:06.152 --> 00:06.951
(Camera shutters clicking)

00:06.952 --> 00:08.552
He is grateful
for the continued support

00:08.619 --> 00:10.821
and respect of privacy
by the American people.

00:10.888 --> 00:12.756
Any questions?

00:12.824 --> 00:14.858
(Reporters shouting questions)

00:14.926 --> 00:16.293
- Cy?
- Eric?

00:16.361 --> 00:18.628
- Is it true?
- What it is is a private matter.

00:18.696 --> 00:19.930
But the First Lady made
it a public matter.

00:19.997 --> 00:21.397
I don't speak
for the First Lady.

00:21.465 --> 00:22.865
I speak for the President.
(Reporters shouting questions)

00:23.133 --> 00:25.535
So he's not even going to
answer the simple question?

00:25.602 --> 00:27.270
- The President did answer.
- What did he say when he heard this?

00:27.337 --> 00:28.837
He said that he considers
these allegations

00:28.905 --> 00:30.973
to be a private matter between
himself and the First Lady.

00:31.041 --> 00:32.808
- One at a...
- Cyrus...

00:32.876 --> 00:34.610
Have the President
and the First Lady spoken

00:34.678 --> 00:36.145
- since this revelation?
- It's not a revelation, James.

00:36.212 --> 00:37.512
It's an accusation.
(Reporters shouting questions)

00:37.580 --> 00:38.748
(French accent)
Well, have they spoken?

00:38.815 --> 00:39.716
Have they seen each other?

00:39.783 --> 00:41.483
The answer to that question
is covered by the statement.

00:41.484 --> 00:42.917
How... is it covered
by the statement?

00:42.985 --> 00:44.619
I'm not going to parse
the statement.

00:44.687 --> 00:46.254
Can you at least tell us
where the President is?

00:46.322 --> 00:48.790
- The President?
- Yes. Where is he?

00:48.857 --> 00:51.893
(Camera shutters clicking)

00:51.960 --> 00:53.760
Open the door.
Open the door!

00:53.828 --> 00:55.097
That <i>is</i> an order!

00:55.198 --> 00:56.963
Respectfully, sir, I
do not take orders...

00:56.964 --> 00:59.300
I do not care who you take
your orders from, <i>Tom!</i>

00:59.367 --> 01:00.967
I don't care
if you got your orders

01:01.035 --> 01:03.003
from Jesus Christ himself
as he hung on the cross.

01:03.071 --> 01:04.837
Jesus is not me!

01:04.906 --> 01:08.141
Jesus forgives.
Jesus saves. I destroy.

01:08.209 --> 01:10.710
And I will bring vengeance
down upon you

01:10.777 --> 01:12.645
in a hail of fire
and brimstone.

01:12.713 --> 01:15.348
You <i>will</i> open
that door <i>now!</i>

01:15.416 --> 01:17.383
Or I will call in every favor I have,

01:17.451 --> 01:19.219
making sure you spend
the rest of your career

01:19.286 --> 01:22.088
guarding baby Teddy
at the playground!

01:22.155 --> 01:25.557
(Breathes deeply)

01:25.625 --> 01:28.727
I need a reason
to open that door, sir.

01:28.794 --> 01:30.161
A credible threat.

01:30.230 --> 01:32.797
He's having a heart attack.
He just texted me!

01:32.865 --> 01:35.567
(Kissing)

01:38.771 --> 01:40.438
(Moans)

01:44.676 --> 01:45.643
Get up!

01:49.013 --> 01:50.182
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

01:50.250 --> 01:53.284
Sync and corrections by bellows
www.addic7ed.com

01:53.552 --> 01:55.720
Of course he cheated on her.
He's a cheater.

01:55.787 --> 01:58.321
He cheated on the election,
then he cheated on his wife.

01:58.389 --> 01:59.989
<i>(Cyrus) - Eric?</i>
- Not that I'm still angry about that.

02:00.057 --> 02:02.158
I made my choice.
I'm part of the team now.

02:02.226 --> 02:04.594
"Go, gladiators."
But the irony...

02:04.662 --> 02:07.764
The sheer irony that a man
who stole the White House

02:07.831 --> 02:09.532
is gonna be thrown out
of office for this.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.434
- Adultery isn't illegal.
- No.

02:11.502 --> 02:14.035
But if Grant got this woman
a job to keep her quiet...

02:14.103 --> 02:16.438
If she influenced policy
the teeniest, tiniest bit,

02:16.506 --> 02:19.841
that's it, game over.
<i>Adios, Presidente!</i>

02:19.909 --> 02:22.010
And that's just Grant.
This woman?

02:22.078 --> 02:23.479
The one he's having
an affair with?

02:23.546 --> 02:25.114
They haven't released her name
yet, but you know it's coming,

02:25.582 --> 02:27.283
and when it does...

02:27.350 --> 02:29.950
Let's just say I hope she has
Olivia Pope on her team.

02:32.087 --> 02:33.788
I'll put my ear to the ground,
find out what I can

02:33.855 --> 02:36.424
about how the public
is taking all this,

02:36.492 --> 02:38.626
how it's being messaged
by the news anchors and pundits,

02:38.694 --> 02:40.194
and I'll get some intel
on Mellie

02:40.262 --> 02:41.929
and what her next move
is going to be.

02:41.997 --> 02:43.898
- And then Cyrus and I ca...
- No.

02:43.965 --> 02:46.933
Fitz!
No! You don't do anything.

02:47.001 --> 02:49.035
This is my problem.

02:49.103 --> 02:51.204
I made a decision,

02:51.272 --> 02:53.440
and I'm going to deal with it.

02:55.310 --> 02:57.877
- What?
- What?

02:57.945 --> 03:00.246
- You have a look on your face.
- 'Cause you are wrong.

03:00.314 --> 03:02.114
- I am not wrong.
- I am very good at what I do.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.783
I am better at it
than anybody else.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.250
That's not arrogance,
that's fact.

03:05.319 --> 03:06.752
And I am definitely
better at it

03:06.820 --> 03:08.287
than you and your boys
at the White House.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.622
You need me if you're
going to survive this.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.657
Maybe.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.626
But you are not fixing

03:13.694 --> 03:15.494
or handling me anymore, Livvie.

03:15.562 --> 03:17.762
And if <i>we</i> are
gonna survive this,

03:17.830 --> 03:19.997
if you and I are gonna
make it together,

03:20.065 --> 03:21.933
you have to stand down.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
But...

03:23.068 --> 03:25.069
Stand down.

03:26.539 --> 03:29.741
And wait for me to do this
on my own.

03:31.344 --> 03:33.711
You are not in charge
of everything.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:43.722 --> 03:44.788
Fine.

03:52.363 --> 03:54.364
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

03:56.967 --> 03:58.768
(Olivia sighs) There you are.
Everything okay?

03:58.836 --> 04:01.471
Did you hear?
The President banged someone.

04:01.538 --> 04:03.606
- Where are we with Charlie?
- He's still on the wind.

04:03.674 --> 04:05.306
But that book club girl
he was dating?

04:05.375 --> 04:07.876
It wasn't her literary mind
he was attracted to.

04:07.943 --> 04:09.811
It was her laptop.
Turns out she was the stenographer

04:09.879 --> 04:11.713
at David's grand jury hearing,
the one about Defiance.

04:11.781 --> 04:14.148
That's why he targeted her...
to find out what happened in there.

04:14.216 --> 04:15.350
And since Cyrus already knew
about Defiance,

04:15.418 --> 04:16.285
and not just knew about it,

04:16.351 --> 04:18.353
- but was at the very center of it...
- It can't be him.

04:18.421 --> 04:19.755
That's the good news.
The bad news is,

04:19.822 --> 04:22.823
whoever the mole is,
he knows about election rigging.

04:27.696 --> 04:28.696
(Mouths word)

04:30.899 --> 04:32.433
(Pants)

04:34.202 --> 04:37.437
(Olivia exhales deeply)
(Beeping)

04:39.607 --> 04:41.408
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

04:41.475 --> 04:43.042
(Sighs)

04:43.110 --> 04:44.677
The Cytron card.

04:50.384 --> 04:53.319
(Beeping)
Okay, so I did steal it.

04:53.387 --> 04:54.987
Like I said, I made my choice.
(Safe door closes)

04:55.055 --> 04:57.157
Part of the team now.

04:58.425 --> 04:59.892
(Projector and camera shutter clicking)
I was surprised to be called.

04:59.960 --> 05:02.761
I-I know Olivia Pope usually
handles your needs.

05:02.829 --> 05:04.496
Olivia Pope handles my husband.

05:04.564 --> 05:06.432
I have needs of my own
these days.

05:06.499 --> 05:09.834
So... I assume all you fixers
work the same, or...

05:09.902 --> 05:11.669
I have one rule.
No lies.

05:11.737 --> 05:14.940
I am your priest, your shrink,
your hairdresser,

05:15.007 --> 05:16.507
your bedfellow,
your best friend.

05:16.575 --> 05:19.710
I am very good. All I require
is complete and total honesty.

05:19.778 --> 05:21.712
Can you do that?
Can you be honest?

05:23.482 --> 05:26.116
(Chuckles)

05:26.184 --> 05:28.018
I am the First Lady
of the most powerful nation

05:28.086 --> 05:29.453
on the planet.

05:29.520 --> 05:31.088
I didn't get here because
someone like you

05:31.156 --> 05:32.856
held my hand and called
themselves my hairdresser.

05:32.924 --> 05:34.458
My hair is done.

05:34.525 --> 05:36.260
So don't ask me
if I can be honest,

05:36.328 --> 05:38.462
like I'm some little girl
confused by all the books

05:38.529 --> 05:40.064
and smart talk.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.297
I can be honest.

05:41.365 --> 05:43.099
I can also lie.

05:43.167 --> 05:45.868
It all depends on what's
in my best interests.

05:45.936 --> 05:48.637
I have a very busy day.
So someone will see you out.

05:48.705 --> 05:51.441
- I've always admired your act.
- (Sighs)

05:51.508 --> 05:53.042
The sweetness.

05:53.110 --> 05:55.578
The hint of Southern gentility.

05:55.645 --> 05:58.213
The law degree you never use
but mention all the time.

05:58.281 --> 06:00.349
She's smart
but not threatening.

06:02.618 --> 06:04.453
When you cried about
that miscarriage?

06:04.520 --> 06:07.456
Brilliant.
Flawless.

06:07.523 --> 06:09.524
(Chuckles)

06:09.592 --> 06:12.194
And now you carry
that adorable baby

06:12.261 --> 06:14.561
on your hip
in every single photograph.

06:16.865 --> 06:18.899
That is so well done.

06:18.967 --> 06:20.567
You play it well...

06:20.635 --> 06:22.436
The good political wife
with the perfect marriage

06:22.504 --> 06:23.837
to the perfect man.

06:23.905 --> 06:25.406
You had it.

06:25.474 --> 06:27.574
But then you went
on national TV

06:27.642 --> 06:29.175
and told the world your husband

06:29.243 --> 06:31.244
dropped his pants
for someone else.

06:31.312 --> 06:32.612
Why?

06:32.679 --> 06:34.680
And another question...

06:34.748 --> 06:37.417
You could have named the whore
your husband was sleeping with,

06:37.485 --> 06:39.419
but you didn't.
Why is that?

06:43.891 --> 06:45.657
(Woman) Clinton rules...
"It's not true,

06:45.725 --> 06:47.626
it's not true, it's not true."
It's old news.

06:47.693 --> 06:50.095
We're admitting the affair.
That's where we start.

06:50.163 --> 06:51.596
The President says he's
working on his marriage.

06:51.664 --> 06:53.565
No one wants to think of the
leader of the free world

06:53.633 --> 06:56.135
- as going to couples therapy.
- He's praying with his pastor.

06:56.202 --> 06:57.569
Yeah, even better.
His pastor died.

06:57.637 --> 06:59.304
- And ever since...
- He lost his way.

06:59.372 --> 07:00.972
- Assassination attempt.
- Post-traumatic thing.

07:01.040 --> 07:02.973
- The death of Britta Kagen.
- And Verna Thornton.

07:03.042 --> 07:03.643
I'd like the room.

07:03.644 --> 07:05.510
Not just a supreme
court justice, but...

07:05.511 --> 07:07.045
- But a close friend, like family.
- Really.

07:07.046 --> 07:07.512
(Cyrus) These are excuses.

07:07.513 --> 07:09.580
- I want explanations!
- The room!

07:11.650 --> 07:13.084
- Mr. President.
- Mr. President.

07:17.588 --> 07:20.690
I better not be about
to hear how you're not

07:20.758 --> 07:23.960
giving a statement, because,
oh, hell, yes, you are!

07:24.028 --> 07:27.229
- You are addressing this, sir.
- I'll be making a statement tonight.

07:27.297 --> 07:29.731
- Good! - Where I'll be telling
the American people

07:29.799 --> 07:31.833
I won't be seeking
a second term.

07:41.646 --> 07:43.412
(Reporters shouting questions)

07:43.480 --> 07:44.914
What are some of the options the
President <i>is</i> considering?

07:44.982 --> 07:46.650
Whatever options
the President is

07:46.717 --> 07:48.518
or isn't considering
are private.

07:48.585 --> 07:49.586
(Reporters shouting questions)

07:49.654 --> 07:51.488
Is he considering not
seeking a second term,

07:51.556 --> 07:52.989
spending time with his family?

07:53.058 --> 07:55.525
Whatever options the President
is or isn't considering

07:55.592 --> 07:56.593
in this matter are private.

07:56.660 --> 07:58.660
Do you think he owes the American
people a response, an explanation?

07:58.661 --> 07:59.828
Again, I refer you
to the statement.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.798
(Reporters shouting questions)

08:02.866 --> 08:04.967
(Inhales deeply) Look...

08:05.035 --> 08:07.136
I get this.

08:07.204 --> 08:09.539
You have feelings for Olivia.
She's a heck of a gal.

08:09.606 --> 08:11.106
You want to continue
the affair.

08:11.174 --> 08:12.774
Fine.
Peachy.

08:12.841 --> 08:14.776
So you go to Mellie and you
promise whatever it takes

08:14.843 --> 08:16.411
to put things back together.

08:16.479 --> 08:18.480
Then you can go right on
sleeping with Olivia.

08:18.548 --> 08:20.115
That's your business.
And if you need me

08:20.183 --> 08:21.950
to facilitate, to lie,
to cover for you,

08:22.017 --> 08:23.785
sneak her into the motorcade,

08:23.852 --> 08:25.954
wipe her lipstick
off your collar for you,

08:26.021 --> 08:27.654
I will.

08:27.722 --> 08:31.192
But you're not giving up
your place in history.

08:31.259 --> 08:33.494
You're not giving up
this office.

08:33.562 --> 08:37.231
We will figure this out.

08:37.299 --> 08:38.765
(Breathes sharply)

08:38.832 --> 08:40.601
It's not too late
to save your presidency.

08:40.668 --> 08:41.969
Look at Clinton.

08:42.035 --> 08:44.003
Clinton wasn't in love
with Monica Lewinsky.

08:44.071 --> 08:46.906
I am in love with a woman
who is not my wife.

08:46.974 --> 08:50.243
I want to be with her.
Not in the shadows. Openly.

08:50.311 --> 08:52.378
And if that means I have to
stop being President,

08:52.446 --> 08:53.580
so be it.

08:55.349 --> 08:56.949
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

08:57.017 --> 08:59.318
- This is what I found in...
- Didn't I see you last night?

08:59.385 --> 09:00.952
Yes. Why?

09:01.020 --> 09:02.687
So you knew last night
and you didn't tell me.

09:02.755 --> 09:05.424
- Tell you what, sir?
- Your mission was clear.

09:05.492 --> 09:07.493
- Get between the President
and Ms. Pope. - Yes, sir.

09:07.560 --> 09:09.161
Not only did you fail
in your mission,

09:09.229 --> 09:10.962
but you failed to report to me
that the President

09:11.030 --> 09:12.965
was spending the night
with her... the same night...

09:13.033 --> 09:17.101
- Sir, I can explain...
- You do not interrupt me ever.

09:21.072 --> 09:24.108
Now what's this photo about?

09:24.176 --> 09:26.277
This is the man who's on to me.

09:26.345 --> 09:27.711
He knows about my relationship
with Ms. Pope.

09:27.779 --> 09:29.147
He's working with Cyrus Beene.

09:29.214 --> 09:30.580
Is there proof of your
relationship with Ms. Pope?

09:30.648 --> 09:31.748
Recorded proof?
Yes, sir.

09:31.815 --> 09:33.150
Bring it to me.

09:33.217 --> 09:35.285
And what about him?
Find him. Bring him in.

09:35.353 --> 09:38.188
- And Cyrus Beene?
- I'll handle Cyrus Beene.

09:38.256 --> 09:40.490
Just bring me the tape.

09:44.995 --> 09:46.328
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

09:46.396 --> 09:48.164
Oh, Cyrus.
I am truly amazed

09:48.231 --> 09:50.599
at how you are handling
this difficult situation

09:50.667 --> 09:52.701
with such grace and class.

09:52.769 --> 09:55.504
I just cannot believe,
after everything

09:55.572 --> 09:57.072
the President has survived...

09:57.140 --> 09:59.041
That sad little bout
with Amanda Tanner

09:59.108 --> 10:01.510
and Billy Chambers,
an assassination attempt?

10:01.578 --> 10:03.978
Who would have thought
it would be his own wife

10:04.046 --> 10:05.680
who finally brings him down?

10:05.747 --> 10:07.848
- Well, you know what the Bible says.
- No, I don't.

10:07.916 --> 10:09.884
"Hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned."

10:09.951 --> 10:11.352
That's not from the Bible.

10:11.420 --> 10:13.521
Not everything is from
the Bible, Sally.

10:13.589 --> 10:14.589
(Cyrus sighs)

10:14.657 --> 10:16.023
It has to be Sally Langston.

10:16.091 --> 10:17.392
She and the Secretary
of Defense

10:17.459 --> 10:18.958
are the only two people
we haven't ruled out

10:19.026 --> 10:20.760
who had access to the files
on Wendy's flash drive.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.329
And since the Secretary
of Defense

10:22.397 --> 10:24.231
was C.E.O. of Bromstead
when the leaks first started...

10:24.298 --> 10:24.998
It doesn't make sense.

10:24.999 --> 10:27.701
She was on that ticket, too.
If congress impeaches Grant...

10:27.768 --> 10:29.269
Sally gets thrown out
with the bathwater.

10:29.337 --> 10:30.671
Besides, we don't have
enough evidence

10:30.738 --> 10:32.272
to accuse the Vice President
of treason.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.040
You said Charlie's in the wind.

10:34.108 --> 10:36.108
- What are the chances we find him?
- Impossible.

10:36.176 --> 10:40.045
- Which leaves us with...
- Sally Langston. Let's get into it.

10:43.717 --> 10:45.017
(Door closes) What do you...

10:45.085 --> 10:47.753
- What's the endgame?
- My endgame?

10:47.821 --> 10:49.021
The First Lady just
put you on notice.

10:49.089 --> 10:50.922
We don't have a lot of time.

10:50.989 --> 10:52.790
- This needs to be dealt with.
- No, it doesn't.

10:52.858 --> 10:54.025
(Typing) Let it be.

10:54.093 --> 10:55.560
Right now, at this very moment,

10:55.628 --> 10:57.429
you are standing in the eye
of the hurricane, and

10:57.496 --> 10:59.264
- you're gonna sit here and pretend?
- I'm not pretending.

10:59.332 --> 11:01.433
You think that White House
is gonna protect you? Hmm?

11:01.500 --> 11:03.702
- Is that it? - I can protect myself,
thank you very much.

11:03.769 --> 11:06.237
You're not the fixer here, Liv.
You're the problem.

11:06.304 --> 11:09.005
<i>You're</i> the client.
You're <i>my</i> client.

11:09.073 --> 11:11.041
(Chuckles) Like it or not.

11:11.109 --> 11:12.743
So I'm not asking you
for the truth.

11:12.810 --> 11:15.045
I know the truth.

11:15.113 --> 11:17.414
I know enough.

11:17.482 --> 11:19.316
At any minute, any second now,

11:19.384 --> 11:20.884
so will the rest
of planet earth.

11:20.952 --> 11:25.020
So what I'm asking you is,
what is your endgame?

11:25.088 --> 11:26.922
'Cause the eye will pass
and the winds will kick up,

11:26.990 --> 11:30.092
and you... you are not
tethered to anything.

11:30.160 --> 11:31.594
But I'm here.

11:31.662 --> 11:33.329
And I will be your anchor.

11:33.397 --> 11:34.997
And I'm the only one that
can see you through this.

11:35.065 --> 11:36.766
We'll fight to the end.

11:36.833 --> 11:38.933
So snap out of it!

11:39.001 --> 11:41.102
Huh?

11:41.170 --> 11:43.305
Tell it to me straight.

11:43.373 --> 11:46.608
What do you <i>want?</i>

11:54.150 --> 11:56.183
We need to prove
whether Sally's the mole.

11:57.919 --> 11:59.887
Get on it.

12:06.762 --> 12:08.763
(Door opens)

12:08.830 --> 12:10.997
(Door slams)

12:19.247 --> 12:20.248
(Reporters shouting questions)

12:20.314 --> 12:21.014
Yeah.

12:21.015 --> 12:23.150
Why not simply deny
the accusation?

12:23.217 --> 12:25.252
The President considers this
a private matter.

12:25.320 --> 12:26.920
If the President addressed
every question

12:26.988 --> 12:28.888
about his personal life, we may
as well turn the Oval Office

12:28.956 --> 12:30.522
into a daytime talk show set.

12:30.590 --> 12:32.658
The First Lady stated
very publicly

12:32.725 --> 12:34.860
- that her husband is having an affair.
- And the President has responded.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.728
- He didn't.
- He did. I'll read it again.

12:36.796 --> 12:38.597
- It's legalese! - "The President
considers these allegations..."

12:38.665 --> 12:40.532
- That's a dodge, Cyrus.
- Moving on.

12:40.600 --> 12:43.469
- I was doing my job!
- You were trying to screw me!

12:43.536 --> 12:45.303
What was I supposed to do
when I was handed

12:45.371 --> 12:47.439
my very first assignment
as an on-air reporter?!

12:47.506 --> 12:49.174
Say, "thanks, but no, thanks"?

12:49.241 --> 12:50.976
This fell into my lap!

12:51.043 --> 12:53.011
I had no idea
what Mellie was gonna say!

12:53.079 --> 12:54.545
Should I have stood up
and walked out of the room

12:54.613 --> 12:57.315
when she started talking
on <i>live national television?!</i>

12:57.383 --> 12:58.984
Tell me what
I should have done!

12:59.051 --> 13:01.551
You should <i>not</i>
have tried to screw me!

13:01.619 --> 13:03.587
How many stories of the century
do you want me to give up, huh?

13:03.654 --> 13:05.555
Because I seem to remember
doing that not too long ago.

13:05.623 --> 13:07.891
Don't you dare
mention that in here.

13:07.959 --> 13:09.626
When your boss asks you
to sit down

13:09.694 --> 13:11.595
with the First Lady
of the United States,

13:11.662 --> 13:13.263
you don't say no!

13:13.331 --> 13:16.566
This was my lucky break.
My shot!

13:16.634 --> 13:18.234
You got one when Fitz
ran for governor,

13:18.302 --> 13:21.269
and you took it.
I did the same thing.

13:25.409 --> 13:29.278
(Laughing)

13:29.346 --> 13:33.081
(Continues laughing, loudly)

13:33.149 --> 13:34.582
(Sighs)

13:34.650 --> 13:37.752
You think... you...
(Laughing)

13:37.820 --> 13:41.490
You think this was
your lucky break!

13:41.557 --> 13:45.160
(Continues laughing)

13:45.228 --> 13:47.795
Isn't that adorable?

13:47.863 --> 13:50.064
That's what you're
telling yourself?

13:50.132 --> 13:51.532
And I'm genuinely asking,

13:51.599 --> 13:55.169
because I never thought
of you as naive.

13:55.237 --> 13:58.005
Which is both surprising
and unsettling,

13:58.073 --> 14:00.007
because that's certainly
not a trait

14:00.075 --> 14:02.309
any respectable journalist
would want to possess.

14:02.377 --> 14:04.078
And that's what you call
yourself, right?

14:04.146 --> 14:06.112
A respectable journalist.

14:06.180 --> 14:07.813
So now... now...

14:07.881 --> 14:10.283
I'm starting to think of you
as just plain stupid!

14:10.351 --> 14:11.918
Are you stupid, James?

14:11.985 --> 14:14.720
- You insulting, condescending...
- It was Mellie, you...

14:14.788 --> 14:16.322
(Groans)

14:16.390 --> 14:19.392
Mellie got you the job!

14:19.460 --> 14:21.560
BNC would never have
called <i>you</i>

14:21.627 --> 14:24.063
if she didn't make it happen!

14:24.130 --> 14:26.065
The First Lady wanted you for
that interview... (Sighs)

14:26.132 --> 14:27.566
So she could hit
both me and Fitz

14:27.633 --> 14:29.068
at the same time.

14:29.135 --> 14:30.569
It wasn't a lucky break.
It was a chess move,

14:30.636 --> 14:35.874
and you're too...
stupid to see it!

14:35.942 --> 14:39.210
Are you saying I'm not
<i>good enough?!</i>

14:39.278 --> 14:41.745
I'm saying you have
no business in this job.

14:41.813 --> 14:44.549
Come on!
James novak?!

14:44.616 --> 14:45.849
I mean, of all the other

14:45.917 --> 14:47.017
professional
television journalists,

14:47.086 --> 14:48.219
the ones with actual
experience,

14:48.287 --> 14:49.987
peabodys and Pulitzers,

14:50.055 --> 14:51.422
those that aren't
approaching 50

14:51.490 --> 14:53.256
or the least bit doughy
on camera,

14:53.324 --> 14:54.657
you want to stand there
and tell me

14:54.725 --> 14:56.293
Mellie chose James Novak?

14:56.360 --> 14:58.027
Forget about Anderson Cooper...

14:58.096 --> 15:00.197
Who's a frigging Vanderbilt,
by the way...

15:00.264 --> 15:01.864
Or even Brian Williams,
Diane Sawyer.

15:01.932 --> 15:03.666
Maybe they were all busy.

15:03.734 --> 15:06.002
So let's go with James Novak!

15:06.070 --> 15:07.370
He's the guy
America wants to see.

15:07.438 --> 15:09.138
He's got a face for TV.

15:09.206 --> 15:11.006
Your lucky break?!

15:11.074 --> 15:12.441
<i>You...</i>

15:12.509 --> 15:14.810
have no business in this job.

15:16.879 --> 15:21.683
(Stifled sobbing)
(Door opens and closes)

15:21.751 --> 15:24.386
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

15:24.454 --> 15:26.621
Where are we
with Sally Langston?

15:26.688 --> 15:28.689
Still working on it.
Harrison's making phone calls.

15:28.757 --> 15:30.425
If we had her password,
we could get onto

15:30.493 --> 15:32.127
the White House's network,
see if she accessed

15:32.194 --> 15:34.729
the same classified files that
were on the mole's flash drive.

15:34.796 --> 15:36.931
- Can you hack your way in?
- There are thousands of safeguards.

15:36.999 --> 15:39.167
- It would take weeks, maybe months.
- And there's no other way?

15:39.235 --> 15:41.468
(Sighs)

15:41.536 --> 15:43.770
We could send Sally
a trojan horse.

15:43.838 --> 15:45.339
Hmm.

15:45.406 --> 15:46.640
An e-mail infected with a worm
that could bore into

15:46.707 --> 15:48.475
the White House network
from the inside.

15:48.543 --> 15:49.909
We could make it record
her keystrokes,

15:49.977 --> 15:51.512
- tell us her passwords.
- Baby Huck.

15:51.579 --> 15:52.912
The Vice President would never
be stupid enough

15:52.980 --> 15:54.248
to open an infected e-mail.

15:54.315 --> 15:57.183
Maybe not, but her teenage
daughter might.

15:57.251 --> 15:59.118
We use Cassidy's e-mail
to break into

15:59.186 --> 16:00.986
the Langstons' home
network, then use that

16:01.054 --> 16:02.955
to springboard into the White House.
(Chuckles)

16:03.023 --> 16:04.990
Cassidy Langston, 16 years old.

16:05.058 --> 16:06.959
Loves horses, hates poseurs,
and will only date

16:07.027 --> 16:09.094
cute boys with blonde hair
and great abs

16:09.163 --> 16:10.630
who are at least 6 feet tall

16:10.697 --> 16:13.198
and play either lacrosse
or water polo.

16:13.266 --> 16:14.766
We could send an e-mail
saying she won

16:14.833 --> 16:17.101
a date with Justin Bieber.
Or some Olympic water polo dude.

16:17.170 --> 16:20.372
(Snorts) Lame.
And really lame.

16:20.439 --> 16:22.106
- Excuse me? - I spent the
last ten months of my life

16:22.175 --> 16:24.576
in a classroom full of kids
Cassidy's age,

16:24.644 --> 16:26.645
studying them,
learning their ways.

16:26.712 --> 16:29.746
They are pack animals, hell-bent
on social domination.

16:29.814 --> 16:31.815
And the only thing a
mean girl really wants

16:31.883 --> 16:34.385
is to rip out the jugular
of an even meaner girl.

16:34.452 --> 16:36.320
Get me the student directory.

16:36.388 --> 16:39.557
(Typing)

16:39.624 --> 16:42.259
(David) Mnh-mnh.
That one.

16:42.327 --> 16:44.495
(Quinn) Brooke Sullivan,
class of 2014.

16:44.563 --> 16:46.396
- She's the queen. - So we need
to find something on Brooke

16:46.463 --> 16:48.097
- that Cassidy would want.
- Got it.

16:48.165 --> 16:50.500
Oh!
Nose job, before and after.

16:50.568 --> 16:52.001
Happened right before
she moved to D.C.

16:52.069 --> 16:54.304
- So none of her classmates know?
- Yet.

16:54.371 --> 16:55.805
(Huck) Got the e-mail.
(Taps key)

16:55.872 --> 16:57.973
- Sent.
- Now we wait.

16:58.041 --> 16:59.475
(Chimes) No, we don't.

16:59.543 --> 17:00.976
(Snaps fingers) She clicked it.

17:01.044 --> 17:03.011
(Abby) - Already?
- We're in.

17:03.079 --> 17:05.880
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

17:12.154 --> 17:14.690
This park, it used to be
a graveyard.

17:14.757 --> 17:16.458
(Laughs)

17:16.526 --> 17:19.059
And I was just about to ask
how you were holding up.

17:19.127 --> 17:22.430
- You can't do this to me.
- (Laughs) Let's be clear.

17:22.497 --> 17:24.732
I am not the President.
I am not doing anything.

17:24.799 --> 17:26.666
Whatever it is you said to him

17:26.734 --> 17:28.603
to make him do this,
you need to take it back.

17:28.670 --> 17:30.137
This was his choice.

17:30.205 --> 17:31.805
He made a choice.
He decided.

17:31.873 --> 17:33.906
If he walks away, if he
doesn't run for re-election,

17:33.974 --> 17:36.643
that is a blow the republican
party will not recover from,

17:36.711 --> 17:38.378
not for years,
and if it does recover,

17:38.446 --> 17:40.179
it'll be in the hands
of Sally Langston

17:40.248 --> 17:41.848
and her conservative overlords,

17:41.915 --> 17:44.651
and the rights of people
like me... and you...

17:44.719 --> 17:46.085
Do not bring my rights
into this.

17:46.153 --> 17:48.755
It will be the Salem
witch trials, Liv.

17:48.822 --> 17:52.958
It'll be, "I saw goody Johnson
with the devil, here in D.C."

17:53.025 --> 17:55.661
And the republic will burn
and the seas will run blood,

17:55.729 --> 17:57.162
and the four horsemen will ride

17:57.230 --> 17:59.231
all because he wants
to be with me?

17:59.299 --> 18:00.599
Right, Cy?

18:02.269 --> 18:04.570
Mellie's going to name you
as his mistress.

18:04.638 --> 18:06.103
It's just a matter of time.
You know that.

18:06.171 --> 18:08.573
I know.

18:08.641 --> 18:10.808
You could stop this
at any time.

18:10.876 --> 18:12.744
He will listen to you.

18:12.811 --> 18:14.178
Cyrus.

18:14.246 --> 18:16.247
If I honestly thought
that this was right for him,

18:16.315 --> 18:19.917
giving up his chance
to run again...

18:19.985 --> 18:23.153
If I truly believed
that this...

18:23.220 --> 18:26.757
Is what he wanted,

18:26.824 --> 18:29.359
I would fight to the death
to give it to him.

18:29.427 --> 18:31.261
I would slay dragons for him.
(Chuckles)

18:31.329 --> 18:34.498
But it's not right.
It's not.

18:34.565 --> 18:36.366
I believe in him, Liv.

18:36.434 --> 18:37.767
I believe in him, too.

18:37.834 --> 18:39.134
Then don't let him do this.

18:41.338 --> 18:43.105
The future of the country
depends

18:43.173 --> 18:45.474
on you not letting him do this.

18:45.542 --> 18:46.975
We've already changed

18:47.043 --> 18:49.211
the future of this country
once, Cyrus.

18:49.279 --> 18:51.013
Isn't that enough?

18:54.249 --> 18:56.050
Go away.

18:58.321 --> 18:59.688
You're breaking my heart.

19:05.861 --> 19:08.463
This park...

19:08.531 --> 19:10.664
It also used to be a zoo.

19:22.377 --> 19:23.910
Hello, Cyrus.

19:35.228 --> 19:36.995
(Man) What does the President
mean by "private matter"?

19:37.063 --> 19:38.297
We've been over this.

19:38.363 --> 19:39.763
Because so much of his
family life is public.

19:39.864 --> 19:41.298
On average,
women in this country

19:41.365 --> 19:43.467
make 80 cents to my dollar.
That's a public matter.

19:43.835 --> 19:46.401
21% of children live in
poverty in this country.

19:46.469 --> 19:48.002
That's a public matter.

19:48.070 --> 19:49.871
The President
and First Lady's pri...

19:49.939 --> 19:52.407
- But if the President had an affair...
- Careful, Ashley.

19:52.475 --> 19:54.109
An <i>alleged</i> affair
on White House grounds

19:54.176 --> 19:56.044
with a White House employee...

19:56.112 --> 19:57.479
Now we're just making things up.
(Reporters clamoring)

19:57.547 --> 19:59.147
You're a very lucky man, Cyrus.

19:59.215 --> 20:00.916
I don't feel lucky.
Not today.

20:01.083 --> 20:02.683
Well, First Lady
pulls the fire alarm

20:02.751 --> 20:04.152
while her husband
is with his mistress,

20:04.220 --> 20:05.519
and no one's the wiser?
I'd call that lucky.

20:05.587 --> 20:07.121
Mistress? That's reaching.

20:07.189 --> 20:08.990
It's unconfirmed rantings
of an emotional wife.

20:09.058 --> 20:10.892
It's Olivia Pope.

20:12.561 --> 20:14.162
You're surprised that I know

20:14.230 --> 20:15.463
about the President
and Olivia Pope.

20:15.530 --> 20:17.898
I suppose I'm surprised
that you care.

20:17.966 --> 20:20.500
We care about everything
that affects the republic.

20:20.568 --> 20:23.570
You should have shut this
down a long time ago.

20:23.637 --> 20:25.405
You have all the ammunition
that you need.

20:25.473 --> 20:26.874
You know about Jake Ballard.

20:26.941 --> 20:28.375
You know that he's been
sleeping with Olivia.

20:28.442 --> 20:30.477
We agreed you would not have me
surveilled, damn it.

20:30.544 --> 20:32.212
Calm down.

20:32.280 --> 20:35.414
Your guy... Charlie...
Was one of mine.

20:35.482 --> 20:38.550
The point is, there's a tape
of Ballard and Pope.

20:39.987 --> 20:41.787
(Scoffs)

20:41.855 --> 20:43.455
You have the tape already,
don't you?

20:43.523 --> 20:45.324
But you haven't used it.

20:45.392 --> 20:47.326
I've tried, believe me.
It's complex.

20:47.394 --> 20:50.695
It's simple. It's only complex
because you're afraid.

20:50.763 --> 20:52.297
You're afraid to be
the messenger.

20:52.365 --> 20:53.831
You're afraid to take
the bullet.

20:53.900 --> 20:55.367
You're afraid that
he'll turn on you.

20:55.434 --> 20:57.435
But ask yourself,
what are you most afraid of...

20:57.503 --> 21:00.171
Losing the White House
and endangering the republic,

21:00.239 --> 21:02.908
- or losing your buddy Fitz?
- Back off.

21:02.975 --> 21:04.709
You're out of bounds.
This is my arena.

21:04.777 --> 21:05.809
Stay in yours.

21:05.877 --> 21:07.444
This always happens.

21:07.512 --> 21:09.346
People like you
get a taste of power,

21:09.414 --> 21:10.915
and they develop amnesia.

21:10.982 --> 21:14.151
They forget that I have
no boundaries.

21:14.219 --> 21:17.421
I like you, Cyrus.
Use the tape.

21:17.488 --> 21:19.723
Don't make yourself
an obstacle.

21:19.791 --> 21:22.425
Don't test your luck.

21:25.262 --> 21:26.796
Oh.

21:26.863 --> 21:28.764
And your guy... Charlie?

21:28.832 --> 21:30.733
He's dead to you.

21:30.801 --> 21:32.601
No further contact.
Understood?

21:32.669 --> 21:34.770
Understood.

21:39.309 --> 21:41.243
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

21:41.311 --> 21:42.411
(Phone rings)

21:45.248 --> 21:46.881
You're supposed to be
running the world.

21:46.950 --> 21:48.583
I'm writing my statement
for tonight.

21:48.651 --> 21:50.152
By yourself?

21:50.219 --> 21:52.620
You do realize that there are
many, many speechwriters

21:52.688 --> 21:54.588
in that big white building.

21:54.656 --> 21:56.357
If I'm gonna announce
to the American people

21:56.425 --> 21:57.858
that I'm not running
for re-election,

21:57.926 --> 21:59.526
I think it should be
in my own words.

22:01.830 --> 22:04.798
Cyrus has been spending all day
trying to talk me out of it.

22:04.866 --> 22:08.902
- I was just with Cyrus.
- And?

22:08.970 --> 22:10.503
There may have been
some lectures

22:10.571 --> 22:13.440
about me ruining the future
of this great nation.

22:13.507 --> 22:15.175
Are you having second thoughts?

22:15.242 --> 22:18.011
No. Are you?

22:18.079 --> 22:19.379
Never.

22:25.051 --> 22:27.319
You maybe wanna run
your speech by me?

22:27.387 --> 22:29.488
- Stop trying to help me.
- Just asking.

22:29.555 --> 22:30.990
I take it back.
Good-bye.

22:31.057 --> 22:32.024
- Wait.
- What?

22:33.293 --> 22:34.626
What are you wearing?

22:34.694 --> 22:38.030
(Laughs) You are shameless.
Good-bye.

22:38.098 --> 22:39.898
(Beep)

22:39.966 --> 22:41.532
(Phone rings)

22:41.600 --> 22:44.035
I am not telling you
what I'm wearing.

22:44.103 --> 22:45.436
(Jake) Well, never mind then.

22:45.504 --> 22:47.238
Jake.

22:47.306 --> 22:50.041
You were expecting someone else.
Let me guess.

22:50.109 --> 22:52.477
How late did he stay
last night?

22:52.544 --> 22:54.379
All night, I'm guessing.

22:54.446 --> 22:55.980
Do you want me to answer that?

22:56.048 --> 22:58.515
Oh, I want a lot of things
that he gets to have first.

23:03.054 --> 23:04.488
I'm not a bad guy, Olivia.

23:04.555 --> 23:06.023
You're not a good one.

23:06.090 --> 23:07.524
Well, neither is he.

23:07.591 --> 23:09.826
I'm going to hang up now.
Take care of yourself.

23:09.894 --> 23:11.628
Good-bye, Olivia.

23:12.997 --> 23:14.030
(Beep)

23:18.068 --> 23:19.535
Is it someone who works with him?

23:19.602 --> 23:21.303
An aide, an adviser?

23:21.371 --> 23:23.672
Is this woman a threat
to you in some way?

23:23.740 --> 23:26.175
Is she a game changer?

23:26.243 --> 23:28.044
Is she sweet?
Will the public like her?

23:28.111 --> 23:29.310
Is it a man?

23:29.378 --> 23:30.878
Is the President's lover a man?

23:30.946 --> 23:32.713
All right, enough.

23:32.781 --> 23:34.482
(Breathes deeply)

23:34.550 --> 23:37.152
Right now, everyone
is just curious.

23:37.219 --> 23:40.321
Is the First Lady telling
the truth? Is she lying?

23:40.389 --> 23:43.291
Is it poor President Grant
with a cold, frigid wife,

23:43.359 --> 23:46.060
or poor Mrs. Grant with
the mean, slutty husband?

23:48.029 --> 23:50.197
They're waiting to see
which way the wind blows.

23:51.866 --> 23:53.534
Anything is possible
at this point.

23:53.601 --> 23:54.668
(Sighs)

23:54.735 --> 23:56.403
It's anyone's game.

23:56.471 --> 23:58.705
But if we name the name
of his mistress

23:58.773 --> 24:00.474
and put a face
to his infidelity,

24:00.542 --> 24:03.576
well, then, everything's
coming up Mellie.

24:03.643 --> 24:07.146
He's going to make
a statement tonight.

24:07.214 --> 24:10.015
The President?
Nothing's been announced.

24:10.084 --> 24:11.250
Well, he is.

24:11.318 --> 24:13.786
Well, at least
I'm assuming he is.

24:13.853 --> 24:16.489
So if you don't know for sure,

24:16.557 --> 24:17.956
then why are you assuming?

24:18.023 --> 24:20.492
Because I know Fitz.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.594
And what does this have to do

24:22.661 --> 24:24.629
with you telling me
the name of his mistress?

24:24.697 --> 24:26.965
Before I hand over
my most valuable asset

24:27.032 --> 24:30.469
in all of this, I want to know
what he's going to say.

24:30.536 --> 24:32.670
Get me a copy of his remarks.

24:32.738 --> 24:35.072
I can try to get
some confirmation

24:35.140 --> 24:36.773
about his statement,
but a speech like that

24:36.841 --> 24:38.342
would be very closely guarded.

24:38.410 --> 24:39.876
And you are very good
at what you do.

24:39.944 --> 24:41.178
Isn't that what you said?

24:44.015 --> 24:46.150
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

24:46.218 --> 24:49.019
Two crullers, please.

24:49.087 --> 24:50.587
Where's Crystal?

24:50.654 --> 24:52.922
Oh, she got sick.

24:52.990 --> 24:54.724
That flu going around.

24:54.791 --> 24:57.293
Huh.
Thought that was over.

24:57.361 --> 24:58.628
Guess not.

24:58.695 --> 25:01.964
- Stay healthy.
- You, too.

25:02.032 --> 25:04.900
(Bag rustling)

25:10.140 --> 25:11.940
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking) (Clicks switch)

25:12.008 --> 25:14.508
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking continues)

25:17.980 --> 25:19.948
(Exhales)

25:20.016 --> 25:21.315
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

25:24.419 --> 25:26.154
He knows.

25:26.221 --> 25:27.688
We're moving now.
I got his signal.

25:27.756 --> 25:29.557
(Beep)

25:29.625 --> 25:30.958
Right on Wisconsin.

25:31.026 --> 25:32.593
And he should be 100
yards up on the right.

25:35.864 --> 25:37.597
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

25:37.665 --> 25:38.998
(Bodies collide) Sorry.

25:41.369 --> 25:43.336
Excuse me. Pardon me.

25:46.907 --> 25:48.408
Sorry, is that, uh,
Connecticut Avenue

25:48.476 --> 25:51.044
right up there?
Thank you.

25:51.111 --> 25:52.111
Hi.

25:54.581 --> 25:55.581
(Cocks gun)

25:59.352 --> 26:01.153
Pull over.
Pull over!

26:08.027 --> 26:10.562
(Under breath) Damn.

26:10.629 --> 26:11.896
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

26:11.963 --> 26:13.464
What's up?

26:13.532 --> 26:15.766
We're cross-referencing
the information Sally accessed

26:15.834 --> 26:17.036
with the data
from the mole's flash drive.

26:17.037 --> 26:18.303
They <i>were</i> matching up.

26:18.304 --> 26:20.104
Until now.
She was nowhere near her computer

26:20.172 --> 26:21.273
when the file was accessed.

26:21.340 --> 26:22.240
How could you possibly
know that?

26:22.241 --> 26:24.175
Well, look.
(Typing)

26:24.243 --> 26:26.943
At this exact time,
someone using her password

26:27.011 --> 26:28.845
is downloading black op sites.

26:28.913 --> 26:30.480
All right, so that means...
Sally's not the mole.

26:30.548 --> 26:31.981
- So we're back to square one.
- I can't do this.

26:32.049 --> 26:33.617
If I have to say the word
"mole" one more time...

26:33.685 --> 26:34.884
Damn it!
(Loud clatter)

26:34.952 --> 26:37.020
Okay!

26:37.088 --> 26:39.889
Everyone take an hour.
Clear your head,

26:39.957 --> 26:41.224
then come back fresh.
(Exhales)

26:41.291 --> 26:44.159
We are close.
Albatross is out there,

26:44.228 --> 26:45.928
and we are going to find him.

26:49.433 --> 26:51.033
Coffee?

26:51.101 --> 26:53.302
No, I think I'll stay here,
catch the White House briefing.

26:53.370 --> 26:56.672
Watching Cyrus Beene unraveling
under pressure is my porn.

27:02.144 --> 27:04.679
(Projector and camera shutter
clicking) (Phone chimes)

27:04.747 --> 27:06.414
(Charlie) Clear me in.

27:06.482 --> 27:08.883
I'm sorry.
Who is this?

27:08.951 --> 27:11.319
They're after me.
Just clear me in, Cyrus.

27:11.387 --> 27:13.754
You've dialed the wrong number.
And since I don't know you,

27:13.821 --> 27:16.657
don't ever call me again.

27:16.725 --> 27:18.592
(Sighs)

27:18.660 --> 27:22.062
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

27:22.130 --> 27:23.797
(Panting)

27:23.865 --> 27:25.232
Just saying, we ruled out

27:25.300 --> 27:26.833
the defense secretary
pretty quickly.

27:26.901 --> 27:28.302
- You think we should double back?
- Abby's right.

27:28.370 --> 27:29.935
Can't hurt at this point.

27:32.005 --> 27:34.240
Nice break?
Mine kinda sucked.

27:34.308 --> 27:36.542
- Drop the gun.
- Easy, tiger.

27:36.610 --> 27:39.279
I come in peace.
(Gun slides)

27:39.346 --> 27:40.713
Now the rest.

27:40.781 --> 27:43.249
See?

27:43.317 --> 27:45.317
Friendly.
I just want to chat.

27:45.385 --> 27:46.518
Charlie, why are you here?

27:48.421 --> 27:49.888
Simple.

27:49.955 --> 27:52.023
I want to hire you.

28:03.008 --> 28:04.474
(Reporters shouting questions)
Look,

28:04.542 --> 28:05.775
you've tried a dozen ways to
get me to amplify the statement.

28:05.843 --> 28:07.510
Try a dozen more.
(Laughter)

28:07.578 --> 28:09.746
- I'm not going to expand on...
- But by "unfaithful,"

28:09.813 --> 28:12.314
does the First Lady mean
multiple women?

28:12.382 --> 28:13.950
Asked and answered.
Any other...

28:14.018 --> 28:15.585
What are the legal ra...
What are the legal ramifications

28:15.653 --> 28:17.253
- being considered in this matter?
- Asked and answered.

28:17.320 --> 28:18.888
Cyrus, did the President
force the First Lady

28:18.956 --> 28:20.722
- out of the residence?
- Asked and answered.

28:20.790 --> 28:22.624
- Did the President try to stop the
First Lady... - Asked and answered.

28:22.692 --> 28:24.259
(Echoing) Asked and answered.
Asked and answered.

28:24.326 --> 28:26.028
Asked and answered.
Asked and answered.

28:26.095 --> 28:27.362
(Sighs)

28:29.666 --> 28:31.867
Finished my speech.
Have a look.

28:33.335 --> 28:35.871
(Inhales and exhales deeply)

28:35.939 --> 28:39.807
"I stand before you asking
for your forgiveness for..."

28:39.875 --> 28:41.475
"Sins against my wife
and my marriage

28:41.543 --> 28:44.378
will overshadow
all good work ongoing..."

28:44.446 --> 28:45.913
"And so for the good
of the nation,

28:45.981 --> 28:49.149
I withdraw my candidacy
for a second term..."

28:49.217 --> 28:50.517
It's fine.

28:51.820 --> 28:54.087
No notes?
That's a first.

28:58.693 --> 29:00.393
It's gonna be all right.

29:00.461 --> 29:02.361
We'll be a lame duck
administration.

29:02.429 --> 29:05.364
- We'll leave proud of the work we did.
- We'll be a joke.

29:05.432 --> 29:08.901
Hell, we're not even
supposed to be here.

29:08.969 --> 29:12.204
Need I remind you,
you stole this ride?

29:12.271 --> 29:14.539
At least we got
some mileage out of it.

29:14.608 --> 29:16.408
True.
(Inhales)

29:16.476 --> 29:18.276
And the backseat
did see some action.

29:18.344 --> 29:19.812
(Laughs)

29:19.879 --> 29:21.346
(Laughs)
Yeah, that was my fault.

29:21.414 --> 29:24.016
(Both laughing)

29:24.084 --> 29:25.483
(Continues laughing)

29:25.550 --> 29:26.951
(Continues laughing)

29:28.386 --> 29:29.721
This is...

29:29.788 --> 29:31.789
This is Fitz's handwriting.

29:31.857 --> 29:33.357
It's from his trash.

29:33.425 --> 29:36.494
I called in a very special
White House favor to get it.

29:36.561 --> 29:38.162
(Exhales softly)

29:38.230 --> 29:40.864
He's not budging.

29:40.932 --> 29:43.767
The man is not budging.

29:47.238 --> 29:49.940
He's throwing away
his presidency

29:50.008 --> 29:52.009
like...

29:52.076 --> 29:53.543
Like it was nothing.

29:53.611 --> 29:56.179
That's why you won't name
his mistress.

29:56.247 --> 29:58.881
Because naming her
is the nuclear option.

29:58.949 --> 30:01.117
Naming her would
blow this all up.

30:01.184 --> 30:03.019
Naming her will
make him hate you,

30:03.086 --> 30:04.920
and you don't want him
to hate you,

30:04.988 --> 30:06.588
because in the back
of your mind,

30:06.657 --> 30:10.459
you still think there's a chance
that he will come back to you.

30:10.527 --> 30:13.094
(Exhales sharply)

30:13.162 --> 30:15.964
(Sighs)

30:16.032 --> 30:18.599
I am very good at what I do.

30:18.668 --> 30:21.602
I can move mountains
and work miracles.

30:21.671 --> 30:24.338
But I can't make
your husband love you.

30:25.607 --> 30:29.109
(Sighs)

30:29.177 --> 30:31.145
He can write all the sad-sack
speeches he wants,

30:31.212 --> 30:33.947
but at the end of the day,

30:34.015 --> 30:36.684
he's not going to go through
with it.

30:38.252 --> 30:39.920
He won't give it all up.

30:41.422 --> 30:43.023
Mrs. Grant, you can
still give me the name...

30:43.091 --> 30:44.757
No!

30:46.126 --> 30:48.527
I know Fitz.

30:48.595 --> 30:51.564
He won't throw it all away.

30:51.631 --> 30:53.800
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

30:53.867 --> 30:55.301
(Charlie) It's b613.

30:55.368 --> 30:56.468
I'm supposed to be
in retirement.

30:56.536 --> 30:58.404
I'm not supposed...

30:58.471 --> 31:00.139
I'm done.
I'm toast.

31:00.207 --> 31:01.539
Who's the mole, Charlie?
Who are you working for?

31:01.607 --> 31:03.809
Hey, now. Nothing
in this world comes for free.

31:03.876 --> 31:05.410
- I want the deal.
- What deal?

31:05.477 --> 31:07.779
The one he has.

31:07.847 --> 31:10.281
- I don't know what you're
talking about. - Oh, come on.

31:10.349 --> 31:12.283
When command wants you dead,
you're a dead man.

31:12.351 --> 31:14.319
Yet here you are. You're not
running, you're not hiding.

31:14.386 --> 31:16.954
You have a life.
I want a life, too.

31:17.022 --> 31:20.257
I want the deal
she got for you.

31:20.325 --> 31:22.093
What's this deal
you made for him?

31:22.160 --> 31:24.061
- I didn't make a deal.
- Then how come he's here?

31:24.129 --> 31:26.330
How come b613 let him live?

31:26.397 --> 31:28.833
- They must know.
- There was no deal, huck.

31:28.900 --> 31:30.835
- It doesn't matter.
I'll get us the name. - No.

31:30.902 --> 31:32.603
He took my life and then
he put me in a box

31:32.670 --> 31:34.804
and almost took it again.
I will get us the name.

31:34.872 --> 31:37.473
- Huck...
- My world, my rules.

31:37.541 --> 31:40.243
(Door opens)

31:40.310 --> 31:41.510
(Door closes)

31:41.578 --> 31:43.113
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

31:43.180 --> 31:46.315
(Exhales and mutters)

31:46.383 --> 31:47.650
I need you to pull
the President's

31:47.718 --> 31:49.752
statement of candidacy papers.

31:49.819 --> 31:52.020
Why do you...
(Sighs)

31:52.088 --> 31:53.822
Oh, my God.

31:53.890 --> 31:56.324
Oh, my God. That's his
speech tonight, isn't it?

31:56.392 --> 31:58.160
We need to retrieve
those papers.

31:58.228 --> 31:59.962
I can't.

32:00.029 --> 32:02.264
Jeannine, for God sakes,
get a grip.

32:02.331 --> 32:05.733
No, I mean, I can't
unfile the papers.

32:05.801 --> 32:07.902
They were never filed
in the first place.

32:07.970 --> 32:10.104
They've been sitting on
the President's desk for months.

32:10.172 --> 32:11.939
I keep telling Lauren
to remind him,

32:12.007 --> 32:15.076
but he...
Never signed them.

32:20.282 --> 32:21.782
What's this?

32:21.816 --> 32:23.950
The brown folder is everyone
who owes us a favor.

32:24.018 --> 32:26.186
If you get into trouble,
start pulling those strings.

32:26.254 --> 32:28.354
- If that doesn't work, you switch
to the black folder. - It's sealed.

32:28.422 --> 32:30.190
But only open it if...

32:30.258 --> 32:32.358
- Just know it's a weapon
of last resort. - Olivia...

32:32.426 --> 32:34.360
- And if things get messy...
- You mean, if your name comes out.

32:36.097 --> 32:38.264
I'm not your client.

32:38.331 --> 32:40.266
If things get messy,

32:40.333 --> 32:41.767
you carry on without me.

32:41.835 --> 32:43.468
I can take care of myself.

32:43.536 --> 32:45.470
- (Sighs) Olivia...
- Harrison,

32:45.538 --> 32:48.274
my world, <i>my</i> rules.

32:50.110 --> 32:51.643
(Inhales deeply)

32:51.711 --> 32:53.178
Put those folders in the safe
when you're done.

32:53.245 --> 32:54.913
Combo's inside.

33:04.623 --> 33:06.958
(Breathing heavily)

33:07.026 --> 33:09.126
- Liv?
- Oh.

33:09.194 --> 33:10.127
We need to talk.

33:32.382 --> 33:33.515
(Clicks button)

33:44.060 --> 33:47.262
- The footage you requested.
- Good.

33:47.330 --> 33:48.997
May I ask, sir,
how you're gonna use it?

33:49.065 --> 33:52.067
That's none of your
concern, captain.

33:52.134 --> 33:54.269
- What's next, sir?
- Continue the mission.

33:54.337 --> 33:56.471
Stay close to the President,
even closer to Ms. Pope.

33:56.538 --> 33:58.505
As close as possible.

33:58.573 --> 34:00.140
Sir, I-I don't think...

34:00.208 --> 34:02.509
Screw this up again,
and we'll be meeting

34:02.577 --> 34:04.211
at the hole
instead of the monuments.

34:13.520 --> 34:15.889
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

34:15.956 --> 34:18.925
Mmm. Mmm.

34:18.993 --> 34:20.927
People think the key
to a good doughnut

34:20.995 --> 34:22.695
is either the hand-rolling
or the yeast.

34:22.763 --> 34:24.230
They're full of it.

34:24.297 --> 34:26.266
It's simple.
These suckers start dying

34:26.333 --> 34:27.934
the second they get
out of the fryer.

34:28.002 --> 34:30.002
You just gotta get to 'em
when they're hot.

34:30.069 --> 34:31.503
Charlie...

34:32.871 --> 34:34.973
I want a high-energy shell.

34:35.041 --> 34:37.442
None of those funky
antique bullets

34:37.510 --> 34:39.777
some guys like to get fancy with.

34:39.844 --> 34:41.780
Once you start messing
around with those,

34:41.847 --> 34:44.416
you're just pretty much asking
for a turnip situation.

34:44.483 --> 34:45.650
I want one shot...
One clean shot

34:45.717 --> 34:47.284
at the back of my neck.

34:47.351 --> 34:49.920
Pop my spinal column where
it meets the base of my skull.

34:49.987 --> 34:52.424
Quick, easy, neat.

34:52.491 --> 34:53.958
Means less cleanup
for you, too.

34:54.025 --> 34:56.594
- That's very considerate.
- Do not miss.

34:56.661 --> 34:58.563
I won't.
You taught me well.

34:58.631 --> 35:00.732
(Chuckles softly)

35:00.800 --> 35:02.299
And surprise me, okay?

35:02.366 --> 35:03.767
I don't want to know
when it's coming.

35:03.835 --> 35:06.202
I'm gonna need
a name now, Charlie.

35:07.505 --> 35:09.372
(Sighs)

35:11.876 --> 35:15.345
This job we do...

35:15.413 --> 35:16.947
It's never boring.

35:22.419 --> 35:24.320
Like I said.

35:30.527 --> 35:31.894
You ready?

35:33.196 --> 35:34.362
Ready.

35:36.265 --> 35:38.199
(Cocks gun)

35:38.267 --> 35:39.901
And, uh, huck...

35:39.969 --> 35:41.603
Yeah?

35:41.671 --> 35:45.239
Thanks for the doughnut, man.

35:53.515 --> 35:55.783
- Did you get the name?
- Jeez! Whew!

35:55.851 --> 35:57.885
- Take a walk, Quinn.
- Well? Did you?

35:57.953 --> 36:00.220
- Leave now!
- Or what?

36:00.288 --> 36:03.557
(Exhales)

36:03.625 --> 36:06.158
We solve problems, remember?

36:08.128 --> 36:10.530
You don't understood.
He took everything from me.

36:10.598 --> 36:11.532
He tried to kill Liv.

36:11.599 --> 36:13.399
- He helped put me in a b...
- Huck, look at me.

36:13.400 --> 36:15.702
Focus on me.

36:15.769 --> 36:18.505
(Breathing unevenly) Mm.

36:18.572 --> 36:20.306
You had a job, right?

36:20.374 --> 36:22.674
(Chokes softly) What?

36:22.742 --> 36:24.543
Did you get the name?

36:24.611 --> 36:26.211
- I got the name.
- Good.

36:26.278 --> 36:28.113
Hmm.
Job's over.

36:28.180 --> 36:30.915
(Breathing heavily) So right
now, you have to ask yourself

36:30.983 --> 36:32.550
if you're a gladiator,

36:32.618 --> 36:33.985
or you're looking for revenge.

36:34.053 --> 36:36.354
'Cause way I hear it,
you can't have it both ways.

36:36.422 --> 36:37.522
- She's right, man.
- Shut up.

36:37.589 --> 36:39.424
(Breathing heavily) Huck,

36:39.492 --> 36:41.692
what's it gonna be?

36:41.760 --> 36:43.828
(Breathing unevenly)

36:50.282 --> 36:51.715
The President will address
the American people

36:51.783 --> 36:53.717
directly tonight.
He'll then give you

36:53.785 --> 36:55.486
the opportunity
to ask him anything you want.

36:55.653 --> 36:57.053
(Reporters shouting questions)

36:57.054 --> 36:58.888
Thank you.
No more questions.

36:58.956 --> 37:00.790
(Shouting continues)

37:00.858 --> 37:02.391
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

37:05.029 --> 37:06.829
Well, this is a nice surprise.

37:06.897 --> 37:09.097
- How did you...
- Cyrus brought me up.

37:09.165 --> 37:11.166
No one saw me.
Well, Tom did, but...

37:11.233 --> 37:12.968
It's fine.

37:13.036 --> 37:15.170
What is it?
(Laughs softly)

37:15.237 --> 37:17.405
Did something...
(Exhales softly)

37:17.473 --> 37:20.341
Your statement of candidacy papers,

37:20.409 --> 37:23.011
the official documents you
should have filed months ago

37:23.079 --> 37:26.380
with the G.E.C. in order
to run for re-election...

37:26.447 --> 37:29.850
(Chuckles) They're sitting
on your desk... unsigned.

37:29.918 --> 37:31.418
So?

37:31.486 --> 37:33.054
Those papers are
practically ceremonial.

37:33.121 --> 37:35.589
I can file them at any time.
But you weren't going to.

37:35.657 --> 37:36.924
- I was.
- No, you weren't.

37:36.992 --> 37:38.826
What does it matter now?

37:38.894 --> 37:40.960
It matters.

37:41.028 --> 37:42.495
I'm going out there tonight

37:42.563 --> 37:44.030
and telling the American people

37:44.098 --> 37:45.531
that I am not running
for a second term.

37:45.599 --> 37:48.534
- It doesn't matter.
- It matters.

37:48.602 --> 37:51.337
Were you planning to run or not?

37:51.405 --> 37:52.906
- Why are you so...
- Were you planning to run or not?

37:52.973 --> 37:56.609
- Olivia.
- Were you planning to run... or not?

38:00.413 --> 38:01.479
(Exhales)

38:01.547 --> 38:03.248
Fitz.

38:03.316 --> 38:05.084
Look at me.

38:05.151 --> 38:08.921
This is not a conversation
we are going to have.

38:08.988 --> 38:10.789
I chose you.

38:10.857 --> 38:12.457
I know you want to be with me.

38:12.525 --> 38:13.758
- I believe that, but...
- Liv...

38:13.826 --> 38:15.059
Listen to me.

38:15.127 --> 38:16.560
If you don't want to be
President anymore,

38:16.628 --> 38:18.295
if that's why you're quitting,
then that's okay.

38:19.063 --> 38:22.566
That's great.
That's bold and brave.

38:22.634 --> 38:25.669
Is that what's happening?
Are you being bold and brave?

38:25.937 --> 38:27.170
Because I don't think so.

38:32.776 --> 38:34.443
I think you're quitting

38:34.511 --> 38:36.512
because you don't believe
you can win on your own.

38:36.579 --> 38:38.313
I think you believe
you are everything

38:38.381 --> 38:40.215
your father you said you were.

38:40.283 --> 38:42.351
And I think you believe
you don't have what it takes

38:42.418 --> 38:44.153
to be a legitimate President.

38:44.220 --> 38:46.655
And I think you wouldn't
believe any of that...

38:46.722 --> 38:48.556
You wouldn't be afraid,
you wouldn't doubt yourself...

38:48.624 --> 38:50.025
If it weren't for Defiance,

38:50.092 --> 38:52.293
if it weren't for what
we did to you in Defiance,

38:52.361 --> 38:53.962
what <i>I</i> did to you in Defiance.

38:54.030 --> 38:56.998
I already made my decision.

38:57.066 --> 38:59.534
I already...

38:59.601 --> 39:01.235
Why can't you just let this go?

39:01.303 --> 39:03.303
I did this to you.

39:03.371 --> 39:05.539
And if you give up
your chance to run again,

39:05.606 --> 39:08.208
I will blame myself
every day of my life,

39:08.276 --> 39:10.177
and one day, so will you.

39:13.748 --> 39:16.583
We stole that election.

39:16.651 --> 39:18.851
We stole your chance.
Take it back.

39:18.919 --> 39:22.455
Run.
Run and win.

39:30.364 --> 39:32.932
(Footsteps retreating,
door opens)

39:33.000 --> 39:34.567
(Door closes)

39:34.634 --> 39:38.671
(Reporters murmuring)

39:38.738 --> 39:42.174
(Camera shutters clicking)
(Speaking inaudibly)

39:42.242 --> 39:44.776
(Murmuring continues)
(Shutters continue clicking)

39:49.616 --> 39:51.282
He's still got his speech.

39:51.350 --> 39:53.084
I tried, Cyrus.

39:59.692 --> 40:00.991
Did he give you a name?

40:01.059 --> 40:02.193
(Abby) Do we finally have
an Albatross?

40:02.261 --> 40:03.595
(Door closes) (Inhales)

40:05.897 --> 40:08.265
(Door closes) What is it?

40:08.333 --> 40:10.400
What happened, Harrison?

40:11.969 --> 40:14.838
(Camera shutters clicking)

40:20.077 --> 40:22.645
(Shutters continue clicking)

40:29.653 --> 40:32.020
Good evening.

40:32.088 --> 40:33.922
I'll make this concise
and to the point.

40:33.990 --> 40:36.425
My marriage

40:36.493 --> 40:40.795
is none of your business.

40:43.832 --> 40:45.300
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

40:45.368 --> 40:47.135
The card is gone.

40:47.202 --> 40:49.704
The Cytron card is gone.

40:52.608 --> 40:56.777
And because the question has
been asked repeatedly today,

40:56.844 --> 40:58.912
I'd like to take
this opportunity

40:58.980 --> 41:00.947
to announce
to the American people

41:01.015 --> 41:03.950
that I will seek a second
term as your President,

41:04.018 --> 41:06.387
and humbly ask the country

41:06.454 --> 41:08.155
to join me in forging ahead

41:08.222 --> 41:10.757
to finish the good work
we've only just begun.

41:10.824 --> 41:12.692
(Exhales)

41:12.760 --> 41:14.694
I know what you're giving up.

41:14.762 --> 41:16.262
(Murmuring continues)
(Shutters continue clicking)

41:16.330 --> 41:19.064
And as I lay the foundation
for my campaign,

41:19.132 --> 41:21.100
<i>I will remained focused</i>
<i>on the job</i>

41:21.168 --> 41:24.036
<i>the American people</i>
<i>elected me to do,</i>

41:24.104 --> 41:26.272
- <i>specifically, by working...</i>
- Well played.

41:26.340 --> 41:28.941
<i>With the leadership in both the house</i>
<i>and the senate...</i> - Like I said,

41:29.009 --> 41:32.311
- I know Fitz. - <i>To pass a</i>
<i>comprehensive immigration bill.</i>

41:32.378 --> 41:34.213
I found Charlie
in the conference room.

41:34.281 --> 41:35.580
Who knows how long
he had been here?

41:35.648 --> 41:37.917
(Exhales) He played us good.

41:37.984 --> 41:40.986
But it's okay, because even
though Charlie took the card,

41:41.054 --> 41:43.387
Huck took Charlie.
Right, Huck?

41:44.824 --> 41:47.225
(Quinn) We let him go.

41:47.293 --> 41:49.227
What?

41:49.295 --> 41:52.063
Uh, but I got a name.
I know who the mole is.

41:52.131 --> 41:54.632
Both true to our values,

41:54.700 --> 41:56.701
and fair to those individuals

41:56.768 --> 41:58.969
who have come here
with no desire

41:59.037 --> 42:00.537
other than to work hard...
(Cell phone chimes)

42:00.604 --> 42:02.439
And secure a piece
of the American dream.

42:02.506 --> 42:04.308
(Lowered voice) Harrison,
I can't really talk.

42:04.375 --> 42:06.643
It was a setup.
I-it was all a setup.

42:06.711 --> 42:08.511
Charlie took the Cytron card.

42:08.579 --> 42:10.613
Which means the mole
has the Cytron card.

42:10.681 --> 42:12.649
Which means the mole
has Defiance.

42:12.717 --> 42:14.851
Liv, I'm so sorry.

42:14.918 --> 42:16.219
Tell me we got a name,
Harrison.

42:16.286 --> 42:17.653
We got a name.

42:17.721 --> 42:19.688
Who is it?
Who is Albatross?

42:21.058 --> 42:23.226
(Harrison) Billy Chambers.

42:23.293 --> 42:24.626
Billy Chambers is the mole.

42:26.463 --> 42:27.930
You got it?

42:32.502 --> 42:34.536
Nice

42:34.604 --> 42:36.805
now we can start
having some fun.

42:36.873 --> 42:40.342
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

42:40.410 --> 42:42.544
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking continues)

42:42.612 --> 42:44.580
And now...

42:44.647 --> 42:46.047
Any questions?

42:46.115 --> 42:47.448
(Reporters shouting questions)

42:47.516 --> 42:50.284
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)
