Previously on
<i>Falling Skies...</i>

00:02.137 --> 00:03.464
It might know
everything.

00:03.465 --> 00:04.856
And if it <i>doesn't</i> talk?

00:04.881 --> 00:07.196
How long have you been
in communication with him?

00:07.221 --> 00:08.651
Some of them
have been able to

00:08.676 --> 00:10.256
resist the effects
of the harness.

00:10.281 --> 00:11.748
So, how can I
convince you?

00:11.773 --> 00:13.880
Together, we could do what
neither of us could do alone -

00:13.905 --> 00:15.431
overthrow
our oppressors.

00:16.831 --> 00:17.663
What are you doing?!

00:17.688 --> 00:19.325
So let's stop
playing games, okay?

00:21.166 --> 00:22.496
We're not safe here.

00:22.521 --> 00:23.652
The fish-heads.

00:23.677 --> 00:25.068
They're looking for you.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.268
They're looking
for your boy -- Ben.

00:26.293 --> 00:28.293
I have to go away.

00:32.302 --> 00:33.769
Where are you taking me?

00:33.803 --> 00:36.473
There's a group of Skitters
who have developed an ability

00:36.507 --> 00:37.676
to resist their harnesses.

00:37.711 --> 00:38.880
You mean act of
their own free will?

00:38.914 --> 00:40.513
I don't know
how they did it,

00:40.547 --> 00:42.515
but they've started a rebellion
against the Overlords.

00:42.550 --> 00:44.954
How did you
find out about this?

00:44.988 --> 00:47.292
Their leader
contacted me.

00:47.326 --> 00:48.794
How?

00:48.828 --> 00:51.397
Through my spikes,
the same way connected.

00:51.431 --> 00:55.500
When I was harnessed,
I saw and heard a lot of stuff.

00:55.534 --> 00:57.635
I mean, I could tell them
all kinds of things.

00:57.669 --> 00:59.504
Battle plans,
defenses --

00:59.538 --> 01:02.241
Maybe, but we do still
have to find them.

01:02.276 --> 01:03.410
How?

01:04.780 --> 01:06.014
Skitters.

01:06.049 --> 01:07.750
Close by.
Rebels?

01:07.784 --> 01:09.520
Don't know yet.

01:15.663 --> 01:16.930
Hold it.
Those aren't --

01:16.966 --> 01:20.502
You're right, Ben.
They're not rebels.

01:22.072 --> 01:24.508
They're with us.

It's as you predicted.

01:36.258 --> 01:39.394
He's been in contact
with the rebel leader.

You're wasting
your time.

02:06.963 --> 02:08.531
I'm not gonna say
anything.

02:08.565 --> 02:11.934
Come on, Ben.

02:11.968 --> 02:14.837
Don't be like this.

02:16.573 --> 02:18.808
You remember
how that felt,

02:18.842 --> 02:20.910
being connected...

02:20.978 --> 02:23.680
completely...

02:23.714 --> 02:26.946
fully?

02:26.980 --> 02:29.548
There's so much
I want to show you...

02:29.582 --> 02:32.384
teach you.

02:32.418 --> 02:34.752
We're going to do things
together.

02:34.787 --> 02:38.355
You can't even begin
to imagine.

03:01.410 --> 03:02.910
Ben, get down!

03:08.618 --> 03:09.951
Move, move, move!

03:10.920 --> 03:12.587
Dai, Anthony,
keep them busy!

03:13.990 --> 03:16.458
Boon, come on!

03:16.526 --> 03:18.694
Come on! Give it up!

03:28.805 --> 03:31.273
All the Mechs
are standing down.

03:31.308 --> 03:32.942
What the hell?

03:32.976 --> 03:34.243
They don't want to risk
it getting hit.

03:36.380 --> 03:37.747
He's too important.

03:37.781 --> 03:40.550
Then I guess
you're coming with <i>us.</i>

03:55.467 --> 03:57.768
Ouch.

04:02.475 --> 04:04.809
Oh,
I can barely move.

04:04.844 --> 04:06.578
That's the idea.

04:06.612 --> 04:08.814
It will remind you not to tear
those stitches again.

04:08.848 --> 04:11.551
They've been gone
over an hour.

04:11.585 --> 04:12.819
Ugh.

04:12.853 --> 04:15.455
I should have gone
with them.

04:15.489 --> 04:16.690
Not with that wound.

04:16.724 --> 04:17.923
Maggie,
you need to take it easy.

04:17.959 --> 04:19.692
Right.

04:34.376 --> 04:38.445
Your bus is topped off and ready
to roll for Charleston.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.614
You didn't need to come up here
to tell me that.

04:40.649 --> 04:42.383
Yeah, well,
if we're gonna be stuck

04:42.417 --> 04:44.519
in different vehicles
for 500 miles,

04:44.553 --> 04:48.022
I want to grab
all the Lourdes time I can.

04:55.431 --> 04:57.232
He hasn't left the window
since they went after Ben.

04:57.266 --> 04:58.767
How long do we wait?

04:58.801 --> 05:01.770
If Karen knew we're here,
so do the aliens.

05:01.805 --> 05:04.973
Only a matter of time
before they lower the hammer.

05:05.007 --> 05:06.508
And for all we know,

05:06.542 --> 05:08.243
Tom's patrol could have been
in an ambush --

05:08.277 --> 05:09.477
They're coming back!

05:09.512 --> 05:10.678
They're bringing Ben back,

05:10.713 --> 05:12.447
and we're not leaving
until they do.

05:12.481 --> 05:14.716
Damn straight.

05:14.750 --> 05:16.351
Jamil,
what are you doing

05:16.385 --> 05:18.386
when we still can't get
the GTO working right?

05:18.420 --> 05:19.888
I'm on it, sir.
You better be,

05:19.922 --> 05:22.557
because we're moving out
as soon as Tom's back.

05:22.591 --> 05:24.392
Captain Weaver,
what are you doing out of bed?

05:24.426 --> 05:25.627
My job.

05:25.661 --> 05:26.828
You've got no business
walking around

05:26.862 --> 05:28.029
after what
you've just been through.

05:28.064 --> 05:29.697
Noted.

05:29.732 --> 05:31.499
Now, is the med unit
gonna be ready to move out?

05:31.533 --> 05:34.235
Lourdes just sent
the last stretcher down.

05:34.270 --> 05:35.570
Good.

05:35.604 --> 05:37.439
There's still a lot
of medical supplies

05:37.473 --> 05:38.940
down in the basement
we could use.

05:38.974 --> 05:41.543
No telling when we'll come
across a cache like this again.

05:41.577 --> 05:42.944
Take Lourdes.
Liberate what you can.

05:42.978 --> 05:44.779
Be back in 20 minutes.

05:44.813 --> 05:46.514
All right.

05:50.252 --> 05:52.954
They're gonna need security.
That's you, Matt.

05:52.988 --> 05:54.488
Start moving, soldier.

05:54.523 --> 05:56.924
Yes, sir.

06:14.576 --> 06:16.778
Captain,
you're gonna want to see this.

06:16.812 --> 06:18.547
What the hell are you doing
out of bed?

06:18.581 --> 06:20.314
The next person
that asks me that

06:20.382 --> 06:22.784
is gonna get knocked upside
the head with this cane.

06:22.818 --> 06:23.401
Noted.

06:23.426 --> 06:25.437
I'm glad to see you got Ben.
What about Karen?

06:25.556 --> 06:28.625
She slipped away, but I brought
you something else.

06:28.659 --> 06:30.794
Hell of a catch,
huh, cap?

06:33.365 --> 06:35.599
Whoa.

06:35.634 --> 06:39.304
I understood the objective
was to recover your son.

06:39.338 --> 06:41.439
And instead, you bring back a fish-head?
We had no choice.

06:41.473 --> 06:43.308
This may be our ticket
out of here.

06:43.342 --> 06:45.710
Tom, we need to get on the road
to Charleston now.

06:45.745 --> 06:47.345
That was the order!

06:47.380 --> 06:48.714
I'm changing plans.
We'll take him to Charleston.

06:48.748 --> 06:49.982
They're gonna love him
in Charleston.

06:50.016 --> 06:51.850
But I think
we got bigger problems.

06:53.753 --> 06:57.289
Anthony, Dai, lock that big
bastard down in the psych ward.

06:57.323 --> 07:00.826
Tom and Tector, on me!

07:00.860 --> 07:02.961
Lyle, help the Captain --
I'm fine.

07:02.996 --> 07:06.765
Let's move! Move!

07:12.039 --> 07:14.474
Mechs must be hung over!
They can't hit crap!

07:14.508 --> 07:16.609
They don't want to risk
hurting their Overlord!

07:16.643 --> 07:18.845
Draw your fire!

07:18.879 --> 07:20.480
Conserve your ammo!

07:20.515 --> 07:23.283
There must be <i>some</i> reason
they're shooting.

07:23.318 --> 07:26.453
All this noise is to keep
our attention on them!

07:26.488 --> 07:27.988
While they sneak
in the back door?

07:28.023 --> 07:29.890
I'll check it out.

07:29.958 --> 07:31.525
Cover him! Cover Tom!

07:31.560 --> 07:34.628
Crazy, Boon, Tector!

07:37.365 --> 07:39.566
Just --
just leave it.

07:39.634 --> 07:41.502
We need to
get upstairs.

08:45.841 --> 08:47.599
They backed off
after the explosion.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.167
Whatever you did
back there...

08:49.201 --> 08:51.269
seems to have
settled them down.

08:51.303 --> 08:54.305
I hope so.

08:55.874 --> 08:58.175
Tom.

08:59.510 --> 09:02.346
I know what
you're gonna say, Captain.

09:02.380 --> 09:04.815
This is the kind of hard choice
I was talking about.

09:04.850 --> 09:06.416
I'm not offering Ben up
as a sacrifice.

09:06.451 --> 09:09.619
I'm not suggesting that
for a moment.

09:09.653 --> 09:12.121
But we cannot
protect him anymore.

09:12.155 --> 09:16.758
I got lots of parents
with lots of children here,

09:16.793 --> 09:18.794
and every single one of them
is being put at risk

09:18.828 --> 09:20.629
because of what Ben
has brought down on us.

09:20.664 --> 09:21.864
Hey, that's not fair.

09:21.898 --> 09:23.532
It may not be fair,
but it's true.

09:23.567 --> 09:25.801
And if you had
any objectivity,

09:25.835 --> 09:28.671
you would know
that it was true, Tom.

09:35.145 --> 09:37.413
Tell me what to do.

09:39.350 --> 09:42.585
Well, right now,
we're surrounded by the enemy.

09:42.620 --> 09:45.455
And we're just gonna --
and no easy answers.

09:45.489 --> 09:48.158
We're gonna have to wait
and see what their next move is.

09:48.192 --> 09:49.793
Tom Mason!

09:49.827 --> 09:52.195
Well,
that didn't take long.

09:52.230 --> 09:54.732
Tom, are you there?

09:54.766 --> 09:56.600
What do you want,
Karen?

09:56.635 --> 10:00.205
Things have spun a little
out of control here, Tom!

10:00.239 --> 10:03.675
Let's all take a deep breath
and talk this out!

10:05.345 --> 10:06.712
Start talking!

10:06.746 --> 10:09.715
Your prisoner,
my master --

10:09.750 --> 10:12.252
turn him loose
and you're all free to leave!

10:12.286 --> 10:14.621
And if we don't?

10:14.655 --> 10:17.156
Things can only
get worse, Tom,

10:17.191 --> 10:20.560
and none of us
wants <i>that</i> to happen.

10:36.910 --> 10:38.478
Hal,
I'm glad you're okay.

10:38.512 --> 10:40.880
I was worried
Ben hurt you.

10:40.915 --> 10:42.248
Really, Karen?
Worried?

10:42.283 --> 10:45.852
Yes. Very worried.

10:45.886 --> 10:47.420
You gonna make
another speech

10:47.455 --> 10:49.456
about how the aliens
forced you to kidnap Ben

10:49.490 --> 10:52.192
and how horrified you were
by it all?

10:52.226 --> 10:55.328
My master wanted to take
a more aggressive approach.

10:55.362 --> 10:57.863
As difficult as this may be
for you to understand,

10:57.898 --> 10:59.932
I am still
trying to protect you.

10:59.966 --> 11:01.800
You can't have Ben.

11:01.835 --> 11:04.803
Yes.
That's clear now.

11:04.837 --> 11:08.340
Hand over my master,
and your lives will be spared.

11:08.375 --> 11:09.542
Pull your forces back.

11:09.576 --> 11:10.576
Once we're clear
of the hospital,

11:10.610 --> 11:12.177
we'll release him.

11:12.212 --> 11:13.378
How do I know
you won't kill him

11:13.413 --> 11:14.446
the moment
he's out of our sight?

11:14.481 --> 11:15.848
You'll
have to trust us.

11:15.882 --> 11:19.551
Trusting you
is problematic.

11:19.585 --> 11:20.885
You don't
have a choice.

11:20.920 --> 11:23.422
If you won't listen to me,
talk to him.

11:23.456 --> 11:26.759
You've spoken with him when you
and I were aboard his ship.

11:40.306 --> 11:43.408
Dr. Glass,
are you okay?

11:47.146 --> 11:50.582
Yeah, I think so.
Are you okay?

11:50.616 --> 11:53.585
Oh. Lourdes?

11:53.619 --> 11:55.454
Lourdes,
are you all right?

11:59.759 --> 12:01.893
Yeah.

12:01.928 --> 12:05.163
Let's --
let's get out of here.

12:05.230 --> 12:08.466
There's a stairway.
That way.

12:13.171 --> 12:14.904
She said she was acting
of her own free will.

12:14.939 --> 12:16.439
Why the hell
would she do that?

12:16.473 --> 12:17.774
Why of it
doesn't matter.

12:17.808 --> 12:19.809
What matters is,
she's got us boxed in tight.

12:19.844 --> 12:23.179
We couldn't trust her to keep
a deal even if we made one.

12:23.214 --> 12:25.448
We need to figure out
a way out of this.

12:25.483 --> 12:27.584
Tector, we need to recon
the alien positions.

12:27.618 --> 12:28.719
Pick a team.

12:28.753 --> 12:30.653
Yes, sir.

12:30.688 --> 12:33.390
Boon, you up for
a little sneak-and-peak?

12:33.424 --> 12:35.525
Creeping and peeping?
It's what I live for.

12:35.559 --> 12:36.859
Attaboy.

12:36.894 --> 12:38.361
You take Tyreen
and work your way out there.

12:38.395 --> 12:39.896
Find out
if them cockroaches

12:39.930 --> 12:41.798
have any weaknesses
we can exploit.

12:41.832 --> 12:43.766
If they've got them,
I'll find them.

12:43.800 --> 12:47.336
GTO's fixed, Captain.
Good work, Jamil.

12:47.371 --> 12:49.171
Hal, as soon as
we're done here,

12:49.206 --> 12:51.274
I want you and Maggie to go
check out that old access tunnel

12:51.308 --> 12:52.708
we found in the east wing,

12:52.743 --> 12:54.677
see if it comes out
beyond the alien position.

12:54.711 --> 12:56.412
If we go
through that tunnel,

12:56.446 --> 12:58.514
we'll have to leave our vehicles
and most of our gear behind.

12:58.549 --> 13:00.316
It beats dying in here.

13:00.350 --> 13:01.751
Let's hope we can think of
something better than that.

13:01.785 --> 13:03.452
Captain, have you seen Anne
and Matt?

13:03.486 --> 13:04.854
They went
to commandeer supplies

13:04.888 --> 13:06.523
from the basement
in the west wing.

13:06.557 --> 13:08.158
I'd feel a lot
more comfortable

13:08.192 --> 13:09.626
if they were inside
our perimeter.

13:09.661 --> 13:11.395
I need you up here.
Jamil can do that.

13:11.462 --> 13:12.696
Come on.
Let's move, people!

13:12.730 --> 13:13.697
I'm on my way.
Thanks, Jamil.

13:13.732 --> 13:14.698
Yep.

13:14.733 --> 13:15.833
Hal.
Yeah?

13:15.867 --> 13:19.402
I...I screwed up.

13:19.470 --> 13:20.870
You never should have
come after me.

13:20.905 --> 13:22.705
What the hell you talking about?
You're my brother.

13:22.740 --> 13:24.540
I should have left weeks ago.
I knew it.

13:24.575 --> 13:26.342
Now everyone's in danger
because of me.

13:26.376 --> 13:27.843
Hey, it's not
your responsibility.

13:27.878 --> 13:29.778
That was Karen, all right?
She played us both.

13:29.812 --> 13:31.380
They tried to kill
the leader of the rebellion.

13:31.414 --> 13:32.781
They were bound to come after me
sooner or later!

13:32.816 --> 13:34.416
I <i>knew</i> that!

13:34.484 --> 13:35.417
Hey. You should go check out
that access tunnel.

13:35.485 --> 13:36.852
Cut yourself
some slack.

13:36.886 --> 13:39.854
We're gonna
get through this.

13:39.889 --> 13:42.190
If we do, I'm gonna have
to leave the 2nd Mass.

13:42.224 --> 13:43.224
No.
Dad --

13:43.259 --> 13:44.392
we'll figure
something out.

13:44.427 --> 13:45.727
Stop trying
to hold on to me!

13:45.761 --> 13:47.395
I'm not.
Dad, I'm leaving. Accept it!

13:47.430 --> 13:48.764
You're coming
to Charleston.

13:48.831 --> 13:50.365
You're gonna tell them
about the rebellion.

13:50.400 --> 13:51.600
Yeah, 'cause that worked out
so well with you.

13:51.634 --> 13:53.235
You threw their leader
in a cage.

13:53.269 --> 13:54.320
Weaver tried to shoot him!
We don't have time for this.

13:54.321 --> 13:55.522
You think it would be that much
better with strangers?

13:55.547 --> 13:56.805
I understand this is important.

13:56.806 --> 13:58.373
You're 15 years old!
I'm doing this my way!

13:58.407 --> 14:00.308
15-year-olds fought
in the American revolution.

14:00.342 --> 14:02.610
Why can't I?
Because you're my son!

14:02.678 --> 14:05.280
That's exactly why
I have to do this!

14:08.450 --> 14:12.153
The other reason
is down there.

14:12.187 --> 14:14.822
What, the Overlord?

14:14.857 --> 14:17.124
When he was near me
in the woods,

14:17.192 --> 14:19.560
he was trying to worm his way
through the spikes in my back

14:19.594 --> 14:21.195
trying to get
inside my head.

14:21.229 --> 14:25.298
To find out what you know.
Did he get anything?

14:25.332 --> 14:26.833
No.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.301
But I don't know
how much longer

14:28.336 --> 14:30.370
I would have been
able to hold him out.

14:30.404 --> 14:33.239
Dad...he's scared.

14:33.274 --> 14:36.676
This rebellion
terrifies him.

14:38.913 --> 14:40.914
Keep your distance,
huh?

14:48.656 --> 14:52.192
What's he been doing?
Sitting there like a waxwork.

14:52.227 --> 14:54.261
It feels like
he's laughing at us.

15:04.914 --> 15:06.881
- Move back!
- Move back!

15:06.906 --> 15:08.348
Jamil?

15:08.349 --> 15:11.585
Move! Move back!

15:12.619 --> 15:14.153
Jamil?!

15:16.957 --> 15:18.458
Oh, God, no.

15:18.492 --> 15:20.026
Are you okay?

15:20.094 --> 15:22.329
Jamil. Jamil,
can you hear me?

15:22.363 --> 15:24.364
Jamil.

15:24.431 --> 15:26.132
Jamil, do you know
where you are?

15:27.401 --> 15:29.001
All right,
we're gonna have to move you

15:29.036 --> 15:30.803
so I can take a better look
at you, Jamil.

15:46.855 --> 15:48.355
No!

16:05.340 --> 16:07.274
Here it is.

16:19.921 --> 16:21.556
Great.

16:31.167 --> 16:34.069
You still thinking
about Karen?

16:34.103 --> 16:36.071
No.

16:37.441 --> 16:38.908
Well, yeah.

16:38.942 --> 16:40.877
I mean, when I look at her,

16:40.911 --> 16:43.046
she seems like the same person
I used to know.

16:43.080 --> 16:45.081
She has the same eyes that
just cut right through you.

16:45.116 --> 16:48.218
When I look at them,
I can't help but think...

16:48.252 --> 16:51.422
I used to hold this person
in my arms, kiss her.

16:51.456 --> 16:53.290
Even thought
I was in love with her.

16:54.459 --> 16:56.860
You still in love
with her?

16:59.297 --> 17:02.500
No. Of course not.

17:07.205 --> 17:09.140
I don't know.

17:09.207 --> 17:11.209
How <i>can</i> I be, right?

17:11.242 --> 17:13.844
I just wish
I could get my brain

17:13.878 --> 17:16.547
to quit spinning
thinking about her.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.968
So, what happened to

17:37.002 --> 17:39.170
"I'm not the right person
for you, Hal"?

17:39.205 --> 17:41.840
I changed my mind.

17:41.874 --> 17:45.076
Just like that?

17:45.110 --> 17:47.946
Yeah.

17:47.980 --> 17:49.847
Just like that.

18:05.530 --> 18:10.234
There are more scratching noises
coming from up there.

18:10.269 --> 18:12.170
Just try to relax.
We've got you.

18:12.205 --> 18:14.839
I...Love you.

18:14.874 --> 18:18.143
I love you, too.
Te quiero mucho.

18:18.178 --> 18:21.146
We'll get you out of here.
Just hang on, okay?

18:21.181 --> 18:23.649
This should help us
get him upstairs.

18:25.385 --> 18:27.786
No.

18:27.821 --> 18:29.388
Go, go, go.

18:29.422 --> 18:31.857
No,
I'm not leaving you.

18:31.892 --> 18:33.425
This is weird.

18:33.460 --> 18:34.827
What?

18:34.861 --> 18:38.798
These holes
weren't here before.

18:38.832 --> 18:40.500
Matt, don't!

18:40.534 --> 18:42.034
Come here!

18:50.110 --> 18:51.110
He's full of them!

18:55.081 --> 18:56.848
They used him
as a trojan horse!

18:56.883 --> 18:59.217
Matt, go!
We got to go!

18:59.252 --> 19:00.385
No,
we can't leave Jamil!

19:00.419 --> 19:01.853
You can't help him!
He's gone!

19:05.090 --> 19:06.858
Come on!

19:14.399 --> 19:17.335
Those things
can eat through metal?

19:17.369 --> 19:20.070
So can rats.

19:20.105 --> 19:21.839
There's nothing we can do.

19:21.873 --> 19:24.341
They're gonna eat us from
the inside out just like Jamil.

19:24.375 --> 19:25.909
That's not true.
We're getting out of here,

19:25.943 --> 19:27.110
and I don't want to hear
anything different!

19:27.178 --> 19:30.547
I told you. Look!

19:32.516 --> 19:33.516
We can't
get through <i>that.</i>

19:35.286 --> 19:39.255
First Skitters, harnesses,
eyeball worms, now these.

19:39.289 --> 19:41.423
What will the bastards
hit us with next?

19:41.458 --> 19:43.092
It's a tough mother.

19:43.126 --> 19:45.093
Had to hit it
about 15 times to kill it.

19:45.128 --> 19:47.295
All right. We can't let these crawlies
get past our defenses.

19:47.363 --> 19:49.197
Hal, Maggie,
you get the construction boys

19:49.231 --> 19:51.299
to seal every vent,
all access to the basement.

19:51.367 --> 19:53.101
Every drain --

19:53.135 --> 19:54.769
Captain, Anne and Matt are still
in the basement with Lourdes.

19:54.803 --> 19:57.271
No, Jamil went to get them.
They're back by now.

19:57.306 --> 19:59.140
Captain, figured you might need
some help killing these dung beetles.

19:59.208 --> 20:00.373
Did you see Anne
and Lourdes upstairs?

20:00.398 --> 20:00.909
No.

20:00.910 --> 20:01.943
Ben, you're with me.

20:01.977 --> 20:03.811
Mind if I tag along,
Professor?

20:03.879 --> 20:06.047
I'll follow your lead.
You have my word.

20:06.082 --> 20:07.916
We'll see
what <i>that's</i> worth.

20:14.890 --> 20:17.992
Let's go.
Keep moving.

20:19.962 --> 20:22.430
I got it. All right.
You need any nine?

20:22.464 --> 20:24.465
Never leave home
without it.

20:29.938 --> 20:31.973
Mech fire. Best guess --
about half a mile out.

20:32.007 --> 20:34.141
You think the cockroaches
spotted our recon patrol?

20:34.176 --> 20:35.576
They're not shooting
at stray cats.

20:35.610 --> 20:37.444
No, they're not.

20:37.479 --> 20:39.580
That's M-14.
That's Boon's rifle.

20:40.949 --> 20:43.017
That's a 556.
Tyreen's M-4.

20:43.085 --> 20:45.253
Doesn't sound like
they're moving.

20:45.287 --> 20:47.822
No. Damn it.
They must be pinned down.

20:47.856 --> 20:49.123
Come on, Boon.

20:49.158 --> 20:50.391
If you don't move,
you're dead.

20:50.426 --> 20:52.127
Move,
you son of a bitch!

20:52.161 --> 20:53.962
Come on. Come on.

20:53.996 --> 20:55.897
If he can get out that way,
those things can get in.

20:55.932 --> 20:58.266
There could be hundreds
in there.

21:00.169 --> 21:03.371
It's our only chance.

21:03.405 --> 21:05.507
Okay, Matt.

21:05.541 --> 21:07.075
Tell anybody you find

21:07.109 --> 21:09.211
that we're trapped
in the blood lab, okay?

21:09.245 --> 21:12.080
In the blood lab.
Got it.

21:12.115 --> 21:14.049
Okay.

21:14.117 --> 21:15.317
Okay.

21:15.352 --> 21:17.152
Take this.

21:17.186 --> 21:18.653
You'll need it
more than I will.

21:18.688 --> 21:21.123
And don't worry.

21:21.157 --> 21:23.658
I'll bring back help.

21:38.326 --> 21:43.330
Captain Weaver,
are you there?!

21:43.864 --> 21:45.798
Captain?

21:45.833 --> 21:47.867
Can you hear me?

21:51.005 --> 21:53.606
What do you want, Karen?

21:55.709 --> 21:57.777
Lourdes, would you check
these oxygen cylinders,

21:57.845 --> 21:59.846
see if you can find one
with something in it?

21:59.880 --> 22:01.180
Why?

22:01.215 --> 22:02.515
We need to think
about what we're gonna do

22:02.550 --> 22:03.616
if those things get in here.

22:03.684 --> 22:06.519
That's easy -- die.
Lourdes.

22:06.554 --> 22:08.988
Pull it together, Lourdes.
I need you.

22:09.023 --> 22:11.691
We're gonna get out of this,
but it's gonna take both of us.

22:11.726 --> 22:15.896
Now find me an oxygen cylinder
that still has pressure in it!

22:41.657 --> 22:44.392
Let's give these critters
something to think about.

22:45.428 --> 22:46.928
Matt?!

22:50.833 --> 22:53.034
They're after me!
The crawlies are after me!

22:53.069 --> 22:55.404
Where's Anne and Lourdes?
In the blood lab!

22:55.438 --> 22:57.139
All right.
Get him upstairs.

23:03.513 --> 23:09.451
Captain, one of your fighters
has a message for you!

23:15.459 --> 23:16.660
Damn.

23:16.694 --> 23:17.961
Boon, I told you

23:17.995 --> 23:20.931
to keep your flapping lips
shut on patrol.

23:25.603 --> 23:27.104
No.

23:42.554 --> 23:44.155
Damn it, Boon!

23:44.189 --> 23:46.157
Run!

23:46.191 --> 23:48.859
Come on, Boon!
Move!

23:48.894 --> 23:50.828
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

23:50.863 --> 23:52.530
Damn it, Boon! Run!

23:54.433 --> 23:56.634
No!

23:58.403 --> 23:59.536
Aah.

24:26.963 --> 24:30.499
Save your fire, Tector.

24:32.469 --> 24:34.537
Save your fire.

24:36.006 --> 24:38.841
Consider it
a warning, Captain!

24:38.876 --> 24:41.077
You're out of time!

24:45.484 --> 24:47.585
How you doing?

24:47.619 --> 24:48.920
Almost finished!

24:48.954 --> 24:51.388
Go!
We're out of time!

24:51.423 --> 24:53.057
Ready?

24:53.091 --> 24:54.758
Go!

24:55.694 --> 24:56.728
Go!

25:07.474 --> 25:08.641
Let's go!

25:08.709 --> 25:10.743
Go!

25:10.778 --> 25:11.945
Get out of here,
Pope!

25:11.979 --> 25:13.647
Don't look back!
I'm right behind you!

25:16.484 --> 25:17.818
Move! Move!

25:17.886 --> 25:19.720
Come on! Come on!
Move!

25:19.754 --> 25:21.722
Let's go! Let's go!
Move!

25:21.757 --> 25:23.824
Okay. Seal that door.

25:23.892 --> 25:24.959
It's only a matter of time

25:24.993 --> 25:27.395
before they eat their way
through, Cap.

25:27.429 --> 25:28.763
What about
Boon's patrol?

25:28.797 --> 25:30.631
They didn't make it.

25:33.869 --> 25:35.437
Where's Jamil?

25:35.471 --> 25:38.406
He didn't make it,
either.

25:38.441 --> 25:40.842
He...

25:42.912 --> 25:46.915
Lourdes, I'm sorry.

25:51.087 --> 25:52.487
Where you going?

25:52.522 --> 25:53.521
To pay a visit
to our honored guest.

25:53.556 --> 25:54.756
Dad!

25:54.790 --> 25:57.959
Hal, Tector, Maggie,
back on the line.

26:04.033 --> 26:05.133
Open it.

26:05.168 --> 26:06.868
Yeah.

26:10.506 --> 26:12.640
This siege ends right now,
or you do!

26:19.948 --> 26:22.550
At last we have the chance
to speak again.

26:22.585 --> 26:25.620
I've been looking forward to it,
Professor Mason.

26:25.654 --> 26:26.788
Ben?

26:27.890 --> 26:30.124
I'm afraid
he can't hear you.

26:30.159 --> 26:33.094
What do you want?!

26:33.129 --> 26:34.729
Peace.

26:34.764 --> 26:36.965
I didn't think your kind
had a sense of humor.

26:36.999 --> 26:38.667
How does genocide
equal peace?

26:38.701 --> 26:41.736
Tom, if we'd come here
to commit genocide,

26:41.771 --> 26:43.538
every one of you
would be dead.

26:43.572 --> 26:45.974
We have no interest
in annihilating your people.

26:46.008 --> 26:47.675
Think of it
as a correction.

26:47.710 --> 26:48.810
A correction?

26:48.844 --> 26:50.044
Yes.

26:50.079 --> 26:52.046
Your planet,
like so many we've been to,

26:52.081 --> 26:55.584
is, to put it bluntly,
spiraling out of control.

26:55.618 --> 26:58.486
You fight to the death
over dwindling resources

26:58.521 --> 27:00.021
while your population
continues to --

27:00.056 --> 27:03.491
We don't need your help solving
our problems, thank you.

27:03.525 --> 27:04.792
Of course.

27:04.827 --> 27:06.561
Once our task here
has been completed,

27:06.595 --> 27:07.862
we will move on
from your --

27:07.896 --> 27:10.498
What task?
Why are you here?

27:10.532 --> 27:12.399
That is none
of your concern.

27:12.434 --> 27:13.867
But disrupting
our operations

27:13.902 --> 27:16.603
and continuing to obstruct
the inevitable

27:16.637 --> 27:19.505
can only result in more pain
and suffering.

27:19.540 --> 27:22.876
Except we aren't alone anymore
in resisting your occupation.

27:26.447 --> 27:28.949
Are you referring
to the so-called rebellion?

27:28.983 --> 27:31.418
I am. And they scare the hell
out of you, don't they?

27:31.452 --> 27:33.486
We will defeat them.

27:33.521 --> 27:35.021
Perhaps, but you haven't
even managed to defeat us yet,

27:35.055 --> 27:36.623
and we will continue
to bleed you

27:36.657 --> 27:38.558
every single day
that you're here.

27:38.592 --> 27:40.026
You don't
have the strength,

27:40.060 --> 27:42.128
the fanatical will
to prevail against us.

27:42.162 --> 27:45.899
You're weak,
crippled by sentiment.

27:45.933 --> 27:47.100
Case in point...

27:59.615 --> 28:01.850
Stop it!

28:05.122 --> 28:06.856
Please!

28:11.963 --> 28:14.664
Sentiment.

28:14.699 --> 28:15.932
Weakness.

28:15.967 --> 28:19.803
You are in over your head,
Tom Mason.

28:19.837 --> 28:22.672
Now, release me
before it's too late.

28:27.510 --> 28:31.480
Okay. All right.

28:31.514 --> 28:33.815
I understand now.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.656
Anne's trying to patch up
the hole you put in him,

28:51.657 --> 28:53.992
but I don't have high hopes
for our fish-head friend.

28:54.447 --> 28:57.550
Karen was right.
The situation is out of control.

28:57.584 --> 29:00.820
I'm sorry.
He was killing Ben.

29:00.854 --> 29:01.568
If it had been
your daughter --

29:01.569 --> 29:03.470
I'd have been tempted
to do the same thing,

29:03.504 --> 29:05.706
but we cannot let our emotions
get the better of us!

29:07.786 --> 29:09.354
You're right.

29:09.355 --> 29:13.187
Easier said than done.

29:18.192 --> 29:19.726
On the bright side,

29:19.760 --> 29:21.895
things aren't going any better
for the Overlord

29:21.930 --> 29:22.896
than they are for us.

29:22.930 --> 29:24.965
Huh. Yeah.

29:24.966 --> 29:26.900
You don't often see fish-heads
in the field.

29:26.935 --> 29:28.902
This one took a hell of a risk
coming after Ben.

29:28.936 --> 29:31.337
He was trying to get inside
of his head,

29:31.371 --> 29:34.340
find out what he knows
about the one-eyed Skitter.

29:34.374 --> 29:37.376
Oh, the one leading
the so-called Skitter uprising.

29:37.410 --> 29:39.645
I'm convinced it's real.
Come on, Tom.

29:39.679 --> 29:41.646
A bunch of cockroaches
reading "Das Kapital"?

29:41.681 --> 29:43.181
If the rebellion
isn't real,

29:43.216 --> 29:45.484
then nothing that's happened
makes any sense.

29:45.518 --> 29:46.985
Why go through
all the trouble

29:47.020 --> 29:50.355
to have Karen come here
and steal my son?

29:50.390 --> 29:54.492
'Cause they wanted Ben
to lead them to us,

29:54.527 --> 29:56.361
to find out
where we were headed,

29:56.395 --> 29:58.496
to find out --
no, no, then why not kidnap <i>you?</i>

29:58.530 --> 30:00.965
Truth is, we don't pose
enough of a threat

30:00.999 --> 30:02.599
to be worth
all this effort.

30:02.634 --> 30:05.970
But if the Skitters are gonna
overthrow their Masters...

30:06.004 --> 30:08.639
Sure would put their whole
war machine at risk.

30:08.673 --> 30:11.008
A threat that big --
I don't know.

30:11.042 --> 30:13.076
Maybe --
maybe it could be true.

30:13.111 --> 30:17.214
But it still doesn't solve
the problem we have right now,

30:17.248 --> 30:18.448
which is that
sooner or later,

30:18.483 --> 30:20.083
Karen is gonna find out
that her boss

30:20.118 --> 30:22.119
is bleeding out
in our psych ward

30:22.153 --> 30:24.955
and we're not gonna have
any cards left to play.

30:24.989 --> 30:28.659
Maybe she <i>should</i> find out...
sooner than later.

30:41.406 --> 30:44.108
I'll take you
to your master.

30:44.142 --> 30:46.643
I wish things
had worked out differently.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.511
I doubt it.

30:48.546 --> 30:49.746
Took me a while
to realize

30:49.780 --> 30:51.414
the Karen I knew
died a long time ago.

30:51.448 --> 30:55.518
I suppose you're right.
That Karen's long gone.

30:55.586 --> 30:58.520
If only you could experience
the things my Masters taught me.

30:58.588 --> 31:01.156
Yeah? Like how to betray
your friends?

31:01.190 --> 31:03.725
How to shoot unarmed people
in the back?

31:03.760 --> 31:06.028
It's so much bigger
than that.

31:06.062 --> 31:08.130
How can I
make you understand?

31:08.164 --> 31:12.134
You see,
every living thing,

31:12.168 --> 31:14.003
every grain of sand
on a beach,

31:14.037 --> 31:16.139
every star in the sky
is linked

31:16.173 --> 31:18.308
by an intricate web
of causality.

31:18.343 --> 31:21.345
If you can comprehend that web
in its entirety,

31:21.379 --> 31:22.613
down to the movements

31:22.647 --> 31:25.115
of the smallest
subatomic particles,

31:25.150 --> 31:27.684
then you can predict
the course of events

31:27.719 --> 31:29.520
and alter them.

31:29.554 --> 31:31.388
Wow.

31:31.456 --> 31:33.390
That's the most ridiculous load
of crap I've ever heard.

31:33.458 --> 31:35.459
I knew precisely
where and when

31:35.493 --> 31:38.262
to place the de-harnessed bodies
of those kids

31:38.296 --> 31:39.530
so that you and Maggie
would find me.

31:39.564 --> 31:41.132
I knew every word
and gesture needed

31:41.166 --> 31:43.134
to get the desired response
of you and Ben,

31:43.168 --> 31:45.537
up until the moment
he ran away with me.

31:45.571 --> 31:48.140
Yeah, well, you must have missed
a subatomic particle or two,

31:48.174 --> 31:50.008
'cause things haven't
really gone according to plan

31:50.043 --> 31:51.644
ever since, have they?

31:51.678 --> 31:54.080
There are always unexpected variables
that require adjustments.

31:54.114 --> 31:55.348
I made them,

31:55.383 --> 31:57.417
and now you're handing
my master over to me.

31:57.451 --> 31:59.553
Well, I guess you got it all
figured out, don't you?

32:01.590 --> 32:04.158
Move.

32:04.192 --> 32:07.394
Ben,
I'm glad you're okay.

32:07.429 --> 32:09.229
I know this has been
quite an ordeal for you,

32:09.263 --> 32:11.631
but it had to happen.

32:11.665 --> 32:14.500
I hope you can
understand that --

32:14.535 --> 32:16.202
something's happened
to him.

32:18.305 --> 32:19.338
What have you done?

32:23.442 --> 32:26.578
I'm here with you.

32:26.613 --> 32:30.249
Dr. Glass did what she
could to stop the bleeding.

32:30.283 --> 32:32.451
I don't know much
about his physiology,

32:32.485 --> 32:35.087
but I don't think
he's gonna last much longer.

32:43.297 --> 32:44.430
Are you ready to listen?

32:46.167 --> 32:48.101
Good! 'Cause you can
still save him.

32:48.135 --> 32:50.236
- How?
- You see this?

32:50.271 --> 32:52.072
It's plastic explosive.

32:52.106 --> 32:54.140
There's more outside, enough
to take out the entire floor.

32:54.208 --> 32:56.476
It's connected to a detonator
controlled by two of our guys.

32:56.510 --> 32:59.246
One of them's Pope,
and I believe you remember him.

32:59.280 --> 33:00.614
And he'll have no problem

33:00.648 --> 33:02.282
blowing you and your Master
straight to hell.

33:02.316 --> 33:05.652
If he does, our air strike
will kill you all.

33:05.686 --> 33:07.453
And your Overlord
dies with us.

33:07.488 --> 33:08.688
And so do you.

33:08.722 --> 33:10.390
But we don't have to go down
that road.

33:10.424 --> 33:12.258
You let
the 2nd Mass evacuate,

33:12.293 --> 33:13.993
and once we're clear,
you're free to leave.

33:14.028 --> 33:15.329
And if you hurry,

33:15.363 --> 33:17.464
you might even be
able to save his life.

33:44.386 --> 33:46.887
So far, so good.
Good to go.

33:46.922 --> 33:48.722
I didn't get a chance
to tell you

33:48.757 --> 33:50.024
I'm proud of what you did
in the basement.

33:50.058 --> 33:51.859
He saved our lives,
Matt.

33:53.395 --> 33:55.095
Just doing my job.

34:23.760 --> 34:26.594
A quarter tank.

34:26.629 --> 34:28.263
I've been down
this road before.

34:30.166 --> 34:32.967
Boon played his string
right to the end, Tec.

34:33.002 --> 34:34.601
Nothing we could do.

34:34.637 --> 34:36.137
I had the shot.

34:36.170 --> 34:38.139
Boon might still be alive
if I'd have taken it.

34:38.174 --> 34:40.275
Remember
what you told me?

34:40.309 --> 34:43.844
Never ask "what if?"
And never look back.

34:43.913 --> 34:45.746
10 minutes,
then we roll!

34:45.781 --> 34:47.181
We're gonna keep rolling

34:47.216 --> 34:50.284
come hell or high water
all the way to Charleston!

34:50.319 --> 34:52.286
500 miles!

34:52.321 --> 34:55.290
Got just enough gas and supplies
to get there.

34:55.324 --> 34:57.125
This is the final push.

34:57.159 --> 35:00.595
We're gonna high-ball it down
that black ribbon of highway

35:00.630 --> 35:03.665
till we see the blue water
of Charleston Harbor!

35:03.699 --> 35:08.036
Yeah, I heard they got
fresh fish, even lobster.

35:08.103 --> 35:12.640
Oh, man. I can taste it now,
swimming in butter.

35:14.009 --> 35:16.277
Warm cognac
in a tulip-shaped glass.

35:16.312 --> 35:18.146
Oh, yeah.
Count me in on <i>that</i> action.

35:18.180 --> 35:20.948
Oh, yeah.
They got day spas,

35:20.983 --> 35:23.050
ice-cream parlors,
theme parks,

35:23.118 --> 35:25.186
strip clubs
made out of gingerbread.

35:25.220 --> 35:27.721
Charleston's gonna be
a paradise on earth.

35:27.789 --> 35:30.057
If you think it'll be a bust,
why are you going?

35:30.124 --> 35:32.159
That's 'cause he has
nowhere else to go

35:32.193 --> 35:34.561
and no one else
will have him, right, John?

35:46.342 --> 35:49.043
I think you got it.

35:50.812 --> 35:53.748
I've had enough creepy crawlies
to last a lifetime.

35:53.815 --> 35:56.317
Yeah. I hear you.

36:03.726 --> 36:04.926
I don't even
want to think about

36:04.994 --> 36:07.762
how close I came
to losing you today.

36:10.800 --> 36:12.267
Hey.

36:12.335 --> 36:13.901
Hey.

36:15.671 --> 36:17.171
It's all right.

36:17.206 --> 36:19.840
You're safe.

36:21.043 --> 36:24.111
Okay.

36:24.145 --> 36:28.082
I'm okay.

36:31.286 --> 36:32.987
So, a flamethrower?

36:34.289 --> 36:36.857
Where did you
get that idea?

36:36.891 --> 36:39.326
Uh, these kids
I grew up with

36:39.360 --> 36:43.230
used to build blowtorches
out of hair-spray cans.

36:43.264 --> 36:46.834
Perfect for incinerating
model airplanes.

36:46.868 --> 36:48.902
Must have been
some neighborhood.

36:48.937 --> 36:52.005
You have no idea.

36:56.310 --> 36:59.745
I should check
on my patients.

36:59.780 --> 37:02.748
I'm gonna
go see the boys.

37:02.783 --> 37:04.116
I'll catch up
to you later.

37:04.151 --> 37:06.885
Yep.

37:12.058 --> 37:13.992
Glad to see you
back on your feet.

37:14.060 --> 37:15.628
I was worried about you.

37:15.662 --> 37:18.230
These people need help,
no matter how I feel.

37:18.264 --> 37:20.232
That's true.

37:20.266 --> 37:22.801
But you can't help them if you
don't take care of yourself.

37:22.835 --> 37:24.669
And just how am I
supposed to do that?

37:24.737 --> 37:26.972
Have a good cry?

37:27.006 --> 37:29.140
Come up
with some platitudes

37:29.175 --> 37:32.944
about how losing Jamil
will make me a stronger person?

37:32.979 --> 37:35.848
I don't know.
Maybe talking about it?

37:35.882 --> 37:38.617
Talking won't change
a damn thing.

37:38.651 --> 37:42.121
It doesn't matter if you have
a good attitude or a bad one

37:42.155 --> 37:44.924
or if you're an honest person
or immoral.

37:44.959 --> 37:47.327
No matter what you do
or who you are,

37:47.361 --> 37:50.997
sooner or later, something
terrible will happen to you...

37:51.032 --> 37:54.001
like it happened
to Jamil,

37:54.035 --> 37:56.336
to Uncle Scott,
to your husband and son,

37:56.370 --> 37:58.805
to my family.

37:58.839 --> 38:01.074
And it'll happen
to you and me.

38:01.108 --> 38:03.843
All we have to do
is wait.

38:11.718 --> 38:13.686
Okay,
so, what are you gonna do?

38:13.720 --> 38:15.587
The next time
I see one of those things,

38:15.622 --> 38:18.090
I'm gonna, like, turn around
and go "ba-bam!"

38:18.124 --> 38:21.292
All right. Now you're
a real Mason.

38:21.327 --> 38:23.628
That's it?

38:23.662 --> 38:26.131
Just gonna take off
without saying goodbye?

38:29.268 --> 38:31.969
Figured you'd try
and stop me.

38:32.004 --> 38:33.671
I want to.

38:33.706 --> 38:36.207
With all my heart and soul,
I want to,

38:36.242 --> 38:38.776
but I don't know
how to.

38:38.811 --> 38:40.545
It's for the best.
You have to believe that.

38:40.579 --> 38:44.282
Never. I never will.

38:44.316 --> 38:47.886
They'll come
after me again...

38:47.920 --> 38:49.754
and again.

38:49.789 --> 38:51.690
You know that's true.

38:51.724 --> 38:54.092
Dad...

38:54.126 --> 38:56.728
there are more kids
like me out there,

38:56.763 --> 38:59.097
kids who had
their harnesses removed

38:59.131 --> 39:00.865
but still had their spikes,

39:00.900 --> 39:02.200
serving with other
resistance units.

39:02.234 --> 39:03.635
Someone has to
reach out to them,

39:03.669 --> 39:05.036
convince them
that the Skitter rebellion

39:05.071 --> 39:06.171
is the best chance
we have --

39:06.205 --> 39:08.273
How can you be
so damn sure?

39:11.878 --> 39:13.679
When that Overlord
invaded my mind,

39:13.713 --> 39:16.048
he couldn't keep his thoughts
completely walled off.

39:16.082 --> 39:19.852
He...
Two-way street.

39:19.886 --> 39:21.721
I saw,

39:21.755 --> 39:26.193
felt...what these aliens
are all about.

39:27.895 --> 39:30.063
We have to beat them.

39:31.966 --> 39:33.700
We will.

39:39.673 --> 39:41.941
Wish me luck?

39:49.950 --> 39:51.851
What?

39:51.885 --> 39:54.820
I was just thinking
about the first time

39:54.855 --> 39:58.024
your mom and I dropped you off
at preschool...

39:58.058 --> 40:00.660
and how when you realized
we were leaving you there,

40:00.694 --> 40:02.261
you started bawling
your head off.

40:03.897 --> 40:08.734
I was a world-class screamer
in my day.

40:08.769 --> 40:12.738
You kept
screaming, "Don't leave me"...

40:14.308 --> 40:16.009
...as we headed
for the door.

40:17.779 --> 40:20.180
It was the longest walk
of my life.

40:22.350 --> 40:23.817
And as we drove away,

40:23.852 --> 40:25.586
your mom pointed
to the school window,

40:25.620 --> 40:28.722
and there you were...

40:28.756 --> 40:31.892
with your face pressed up
against the glass...

40:33.761 --> 40:36.730
...crying your eyes out.

40:36.765 --> 40:38.165
And now...

40:43.738 --> 40:47.108
It's gonna be okay.

40:47.142 --> 40:49.677
We'll see each other again.
I promise.

40:49.711 --> 40:52.781
I promise.

41:08.400 --> 41:12.069
Let's move! Let's roll!

41:12.137 --> 41:14.372
Onward to Charleston!
