19:55.904 --> 19:57.844
with my boundless ambition.

19:57.906 --> 20:00.656
My family is no more.

20:01.817 --> 20:03.034
(sighs)

20:03.227 --> 20:05.036
Mom, what about me?

20:05.229 --> 20:08.113
We never really... clicked.

20:08.208 --> 20:11.358
<i> CURATOR:</i>
<i> With that, the match was lit</i>

20:11.377 --> 20:13.786
<i> that would burn Rome</i>
<i> to the ground...</i>

20:13.922 --> 20:15.788
400 years later.

20:15.924 --> 20:18.049
Haw-haw!

20:19.201 --> 20:21.961
Who knew
history could be so sad?

20:22.055 --> 20:24.222
The moral
of that story is clear:

20:24.390 --> 20:26.891
Marge is wrong
and ambition is terrible.

20:27.084 --> 20:30.453
No, no, no. The lesson
is that the unchecked lust

20:30.513 --> 20:31.954
for money and power can bring

20:32.014 --> 20:34.473
a once-great nation to ruin.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.293
Does anyone think it was weird
that Dad killed me?

20:37.353 --> 20:39.478
Don't blame me.
Blame your mother.

20:39.630 --> 20:42.298
I just wanted you to go to
one lousy training seminar.

20:42.358 --> 20:44.483
Did you not even listen
to the old guy's story about...

20:44.577 --> 20:46.652
-(overlapping chatter)
-(Curator groans)

20:46.788 --> 20:49.154
When will humanity ever learn...

20:49.249 --> 20:53.084
to stop letting stupid people
into museums?

21:00.710 --> 21:02.501
-(overlapping chatter)
-They're missing
the whole point.

21:02.653 --> 21:03.836
If Rome had kept worshipping us,
everything would have been fine.

21:03.988 --> 21:05.654
Get over it, Dad.

21:05.756 --> 21:08.915
You always get so worked up
whenever you watch the mortals.

21:08.977 --> 21:10.326
Can we change the channel?

21:10.386 --> 21:11.918
This show sucks now.

21:11.980 --> 21:15.664
Yeah, it's totally gone
off the rails since season 2016.

21:15.683 --> 21:17.608
I know, but I want
to see how it ends.

21:17.801 --> 21:20.019
Definitely feels
like they're wrapping it up.

21:20.113 --> 21:22.471
Any day now.
