<i>- Previously on "Million
Dollar Listing Los Angeles"...</i>

00:15.682 --> 00:17.282
- Does everyone
just draw themselves

00:17.283 --> 00:18.517
to the outside
when they walk in?

00:18.518 --> 00:20.986
- This is a big surprise.
- 7.995?

00:20.987 --> 00:24.899
- Yes, but my wife
Leetal is going to be

00:24.900 --> 00:26.760
your co-listing
agent on this deal.

00:27.360 --> 00:29.495
- We got one really good offer

00:29.496 --> 00:31.263
out of all the
showings that we done.

00:31.264 --> 00:33.499
7.6 million. It's
30 days. It's cash.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.701
- We don't want to lose
the only buyer we have.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.299
- Mas alto. It's good.

- What do you think of 16?
- Escrow in 60 days.

00:45.912 --> 00:47.646
Perfect.

00:47.647 --> 00:49.815
<i>- The drive up
here was a bit much.</i>

00:49.816 --> 00:51.650
Got a little nauseous
halfway through it.

00:51.651 --> 00:54.869
- I'm trying to come
up with some solution

00:54.870 --> 00:57.423
where time, like, disappears.

00:57.424 --> 00:58.891
- Like a school bus.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.526
- What if we do, like,
you know, in London?

01:00.527 --> 01:01.760
Double-decker buses.

01:01.761 --> 01:03.629
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

01:03.630 --> 01:04.729
- Fredrik as the tour guide.
- Lower Bel Air.

01:04.730 --> 01:06.765
It's beautiful, so
they're gonna be, like,

01:06.766 --> 01:08.600
$40, $60, $100 million.

01:08.601 --> 01:11.437
- Okay.
- And you don't have a view.

01:11.438 --> 01:14.206
Oh, sh--.
- Uh-oh.

01:14.207 --> 01:15.941
- Oh, my God. Why
did you stop the bus?

01:15.942 --> 01:17.509
- Yeah. We're
going the wrong way.

01:17.510 --> 01:20.346
- It's stuck. This is
a freaking disaster.

01:20.347 --> 01:22.816
Oh, my God. Oh,
no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.486
What's happening?
What's happening?

01:30.824 --> 01:33.626
- What's happening?
What's happening?

01:37.163 --> 01:39.989
- I've never taken
this road before.

01:39.990 --> 01:40.633
<i>Are we stuck?</i>

01:42.435 --> 01:44.337

you screaming at me?

01:45.638 --> 01:47.272
- Back up? If they have to walk,

01:47.273 --> 01:48.808
I'm never gonna sell this house.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.143
<i>- Oh, my God. This is</i>

01:51.144 --> 01:53.145
<i>such a freaking disaster.</i>

01:53.146 --> 01:57.282
I specifically rented the
bus so I would distract people

01:57.283 --> 01:59.651
from this long way
up to Upper Bel Air.

01:59.652 --> 02:01.120
<i>But in my defense, I didn't know</i>

02:01.121 --> 02:03.322
<i>that the bus was
gonna be 60 feet long,</i>

02:03.323 --> 02:06.589
and then the bus driver
turned the wrong way

02:06.590 --> 02:08.160
<i>and got stuck in this crazy,</i>

02:08.161 --> 02:10.496
like, intersection
with upcoming traffic.

02:10.497 --> 02:13.165
Guys, I know we
have a slight delay.

02:13.166 --> 02:16.690
We are two minutes
away from the house, right?

02:17.570 --> 02:19.338
- No. Okay, sorry.

02:19.339 --> 02:21.974
Our GPS says 11 minutes,
because we stopped.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.142
- We have to go. Like--
- No.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.610
I can't believe
this is happening.

02:24.611 --> 02:26.111
- I don't have--
- When are we going

02:26.112 --> 02:27.479
to the house? I have
another showing at 4:00.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.814
- I'm getting hungry now.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.182
- I just--we don't
have time for this.

02:30.183 --> 02:31.617
- I mean there's
what? Like, eight of us?

02:31.618 --> 02:32.918
We could have
taken, like, two cars.

02:34.454 --> 02:35.821
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Sorry. Yes. Yes.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.390
Yes, of course.
Okay. Obviously, like,

02:38.391 --> 02:41.460
when you live in the house,
you would never take a bus.

02:41.461 --> 02:45.464
It's a slight, slight
miscalculation.

02:45.465 --> 02:48.368
I didn't think of the
length of this vehicle.

02:49.102 --> 02:50.969
- Whoa! Stop!
- Stop!

02:50.970 --> 02:52.203
- What happened?
- There's a car behind us.

02:52.204 --> 02:53.439
- Oh, my God.
- Tell her to stop.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.174
Go back. Tell her to stop.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.608
Both: Stop!
- There's a car behind us.

02:56.609 --> 02:59.111
- We're gonna fall.
We're gonna fall. Ah!

02:59.112 --> 03:00.646
This is bad.
- So much for six minutes.

03:26.673 --> 03:30.142
Actually, my 60-foot

03:30.143 --> 03:32.578
So tell me about your

03:32.579 --> 03:35.809
- I do have a buyer.

- Views? Oh.

03:37.617 --> 03:38.917
- Views. The only thing

03:38.918 --> 03:40.452
he wants is the view.

03:40.453 --> 03:43.889
- Yeah, and he likes to get
away a little, from the action?

03:43.890 --> 03:44.899
- Yeah.

03:44.900 --> 03:45.291
- Tell him not to take a bus.

I know, it was a
little bit of a detour.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.934
Come with me
now. It was worth it.

03:55.935 --> 03:59.203
Come on, let's go. I
should have done a test run.

03:59.204 --> 04:01.106
<i>Donella is like in
a dead-end street.</i>

04:01.107 --> 04:03.809
The bus can't even go
up there, and even if it did,

you can't even
turn it around there.

04:05.545 --> 04:07.312

04:12.453 --> 04:15.421
the other, smaller
houses in Upper Bel Air.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.898
- This whole street
needs to be gutted.

04:17.899 --> 04:18.757
Really, it does. Every house.

04:18.758 --> 04:20.559
- We have a pretty
hefty price tag,

04:20.560 --> 04:22.127

Look at this. You have no one.

05:22.522 --> 05:24.256
And by the way, no
one can ever build here.

05:24.257 --> 05:26.919

05:26.920 --> 05:29.194
- Yeah. Come on, let's go.

05:29.195 --> 05:30.763
What I love about this house

<i>is that it's so wide,

05:33.133 --> 05:34.767

have four levels,

05:34.768 --> 05:35.835
'cause you have the roof too.

05:38.138 --> 05:39.705

05:39.706 --> 05:41.740
I think he'll actually
really like this view.

05:41.741 --> 05:43.375
- For a square-foot
basis, this is, like,

05:43.376 --> 05:45.711
the best investment you
can do. And by the way,

05:45.712 --> 05:48.180
the price points of
larger, like, bigger houses

05:48.181 --> 05:51.383

06:12.205 --> 06:14.399
with this quality,
and I mean it.

06:14.400 --> 06:15.908

Teardowns on the way up.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.285
You know, a golden
rule in real estate.

07:00.286 --> 07:01.620
Buy the cheapest
house on the block,

07:01.621 --> 07:03.229
not the most expensive, so...

07:03.230 --> 07:05.249
- No, no.
- I mean, we have clients--

07:05.250 --> 07:08.293
- Not if you want
the best of the best.

07:08.294 --> 07:11.630
Where are you ever gonna
find this for 1,200, 1,300 foot?

07:11.631 --> 07:13.232
What's the prices

07:13.233 --> 07:14.500
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
$2,000 a foot, right?

07:14.501 --> 07:15.834
- Yeah, but...

07:15.835 --> 07:17.436
- And you don't even get a view.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.389
- People aren't driving
up that kind of drive...

07:19.390 --> 07:20.240
- Especially...
- To pay this price.

07:20.241 --> 07:21.407
I mean--
- Especially after that.

07:21.408 --> 07:22.941
- I thought we forgot
about that drive.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.210
It's really six minutes.

07:25.211 --> 07:28.148
<i>Okay, so maybe I was
exaggerating the six minutes.</i>

07:29.215 --> 07:32.849
It's really 15-20
minutes, but now,

07:32.850 --> 07:36.559

so much they don't
ever want to leave,

07:40.960 --> 07:44.463

07:44.464 --> 07:45.931

25:39.739 --> 25:40.939
of these new
construction houses.

25:40.940 --> 25:42.107
- Okay.
- Yeah.

25:42.108 --> 25:44.710
- The opposite to
what we just saw.

25:44.711 --> 25:48.280
2021 build. The lot's
7,000 square feet.

25:48.281 --> 25:49.782
It's a bit outside your budget.

25:49.783 --> 25:54.869
The house is listed at 2.799.
Everything is brand new.

25:54.870 --> 25:55.155
- Whoa.
- Okay.

25:55.156 --> 25:58.223
- I love new.
- Yes, you do.

25:58.224 --> 26:01.609
Sherman Oaks has
become a lot more popular

26:01.610 --> 26:03.529
for young millennial couples

26:03.530 --> 26:06.659
<i>because it does
have great walkability.</i>

26:06.660 --> 26:08.233
<i>It's become more
trendy and cool,</i>

26:08.234 --> 26:10.602
and I'll tell you what.
It's the place to be.

26:10.603 --> 26:11.670
- Hi, guys.
- Hi. How are you?

26:11.671 --> 26:12.771
- Welcome. Hi.
- I'm James.

26:12.772 --> 26:14.399
- I'm Kareen. So
good to meet you.

26:14.400 --> 26:15.409
- Pleasure. This is Felisha.

26:15.410 --> 26:16.242
- Hi.
- Good to meet you.

26:16.243 --> 26:17.543
- Harv.
- Good to meet you both.

26:17.544 --> 26:18.844
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

26:18.845 --> 26:20.547
- Wow. Look at this.

26:21.247 --> 26:24.616
<i>- The home is a little
over 3,600 square feet.</i>

26:24.617 --> 26:27.487
<i>You have four bedrooms
and 5 1/2 bathrooms.</i>

26:28.621 --> 26:31.569
You'll notice a lot of
wood detailing here.

26:31.570 --> 26:33.392
<i>White oak dressing
in all the entryways.</i>

26:33.393 --> 26:34.760
<i>You have a gourmet kitchen.</i>

26:34.761 --> 26:36.619
<i>- I love this kitchen.</i>

26:36.620 --> 26:39.298
<i>It's so bright, and
beautiful, and new.</i>

26:39.299 --> 26:41.133
- Yes.
- He's happy.

26:41.134 --> 26:42.501
- I'm telling you. She's coming.

26:42.502 --> 26:43.969
She's coming over. You see her?

26:43.970 --> 26:45.305
- She's coming over.
- You see that smile?

26:47.640 --> 26:50.142
<i>- Got the hot tub.
The salt water pool.</i>

26:50.143 --> 26:51.510
<i>- The pool is just amazing.</i>

26:51.511 --> 26:52.845
- Right.

26:52.846 --> 26:54.446
- This was one of the
main things that drew me

26:54.447 --> 26:55.848
to putting this on the list.

26:55.849 --> 26:58.817
- Okay.
- It's the perfect studio.

26:58.818 --> 27:00.619
<i>You've got the
pool right here, like--</i>

27:00.620 --> 27:01.720
- Do a song and
jump in the pool.

27:01.721 --> 27:03.255
- Exactly, yeah.

27:03.256 --> 27:06.225
- And then this is included
in the bedroom count or not?

27:06.226 --> 27:07.893
- No, there's four
bedrooms in the house.

27:07.894 --> 27:09.629
- Okay.
- We need one more.

27:12.665 --> 27:16.436
<i>- So this is the primary.
- It has that new car smell.</i>

27:16.836 --> 27:20.272
- Yes, it does.
- Are there two closets?

27:20.273 --> 27:21.640
- Dual closets.
- Yep.

27:21.641 --> 27:22.908
- So two?
- This one's mine.

27:22.909 --> 27:24.276
- No, no, no.
- Let me see the other one.

27:24.277 --> 27:25.744
<i>- No.
- That one has a mirror in it.</i>

27:25.745 --> 27:27.780
<i>- Oh, this one's mine, for sure.</i>

27:27.781 --> 27:30.499
- Harv, you're just lucky
you get to live here, right?

27:30.500 --> 27:31.550
- Exactly.

27:31.551 --> 27:34.539
- Okay, so you've got the
primary plus two up then?

27:34.540 --> 27:35.388
- Yes.
- Okay.

27:35.389 --> 27:37.790
- Two bedrooms upstairs,
and we do have one downstairs.

27:37.791 --> 27:40.160
- Okay perfect.

27:43.730 --> 27:45.664
<i>- I mean, I guess
the two little ones</i>

27:45.665 --> 27:47.466
<i>could be in the same room.</i>

27:47.467 --> 27:49.335
- Yeah. I shared
a room all the way

27:49.336 --> 27:50.669
to my senior year
in high school, so--

27:50.670 --> 27:52.338
- There you go, so
they're coming in here.

27:52.339 --> 27:53.605
- They coming right here.

27:53.606 --> 27:55.749
- I had a twin, so I
never had my own room.

27:55.750 --> 27:56.643
- Oh, my God. Identical?
- Yes.

27:56.644 --> 27:57.743
- And she was in
the band with you.

27:57.744 --> 27:59.311
- Yes, she was.

27:59.312 --> 28:00.846
- By the way, just
to say, bit of a fan.

28:00.847 --> 28:02.281
I have to be honest.
- Thank you.

28:02.282 --> 28:03.882
- Like, for real.
No, no, no. Really.

28:03.883 --> 28:05.517
- Is it crazy being married
to a twin, by the way?

28:05.518 --> 28:07.619
- Yes.
- That was a firm "yes."

28:07.620 --> 28:09.322
- I'm glad you were honest.

28:10.230 --> 28:11.623
<i>- How long has the
house been on the market?</i>

28:11.624 --> 28:14.893
- We've been on the
market just about ten days.

28:14.894 --> 28:16.495
If you do love it,
I suggest to put

28:16.496 --> 28:17.830
your best foot forward,
and come in strong.

28:17.831 --> 28:19.631
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

28:19.632 --> 28:21.166
- Thank you again.
I appreciate it.

28:21.167 --> 28:22.468
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

28:22.469 --> 28:23.870
- It was a pleasure.

28:25.380 --> 28:27.473
<i>- We're as close
as we're gonna get.</i>

28:27.474 --> 28:28.707
I mean...
- For sure.

28:28.708 --> 28:30.429
- You both love the house.
- It's beautiful.

28:30.430 --> 28:31.510
It's a beautiful property.
I love the location.

28:31.511 --> 28:34.680
I mean, I honestly didn't
think that we were gonna get

28:34.681 --> 28:37.499
to look at something
like this in Sherman Oaks.

28:37.500 --> 28:38.385
- Yeah.
- If you like it,

28:38.386 --> 28:40.419
you've gotta go for it,
because in this market,

28:40.420 --> 28:43.756
I will tell you this house
will be sold in a week.

28:43.757 --> 28:46.291
This isn't to put pressure.
This isn't to tell you, like,

28:46.292 --> 28:48.627
"We gotta go."
It's just the reality.

28:48.628 --> 28:50.562
- It is a little bit more than
we would like to spend.

28:50.563 --> 28:51.964
- It's definitely out
of our price range.

28:51.965 --> 28:53.399
- Yeah.
- For sure.

28:53.400 --> 28:54.633
- So maybe we
should just sleep on it?

28:54.634 --> 28:56.235
- Yeah.

28:56.236 --> 28:59.371
- I definitely don't want
to rush Harv and Felisha.

28:59.372 --> 29:03.342
This is a huge purchase,
and it's their first purchase.

29:03.343 --> 29:05.779
And it's a very
serious decision.

29:05.780 --> 29:06.379
It's a lot to think about.

29:06.380 --> 29:07.579
- Yeah, it is.
- But I'm glad

29:07.580 --> 29:08.914
that you both love it.

29:08.915 --> 29:10.849
- Yeah.
<i>- But at the same time,</i>

29:10.850 --> 29:12.451
if they sit on the
sidelines and wait,

29:12.452 --> 29:14.720
this house is going to
be gone. All right. Let's go.

29:14.721 --> 29:16.355
- We agreed on something.
- Yes.

29:16.356 --> 29:17.589
- Yeah we did.

29:17.590 --> 29:18.891
- I'm just glad
to be a part of it.

29:18.892 --> 29:20.392
- Yeah.
- Thanks, James.

29:20.393 --> 29:21.860
- All right. Let's
hop in the car.

29:21.861 --> 29:23.629
I'll drive you guys
back to your car.

29:23.630 --> 29:25.130
- Okay.
- Good first day out, guys.

29:25.131 --> 29:27.330
- Yeah.
- Yep.

29:29.235 --> 29:31.369
- Over ask.

29:31.370 --> 29:32.938
16 million.
- What's the bad news?

29:32.939 --> 29:34.506
- The deal is off
without the sculptures.

29:34.507 --> 29:35.607
Wait, wait, wait.
- Thank you very much.

29:35.608 --> 29:36.909
- No, no, no, no.

29:36.910 --> 29:37.943
- You're not just
insulting my father.

29:37.944 --> 29:39.112
You're insulting my grandmother.

29:39.212 --> 29:46.953
<i>[percussive music]</i>

29:47.187 --> 29:52.358

29:52.359 --> 29:54.760

a few blocks away

29:54.761 --> 29:56.462

29:56.463 --> 29:57.796

<i>- I've had my eye

30:00.100 --> 30:01.633

30:01.634 --> 30:02.935
so don't get too excited.

30:02.936 --> 30:04.369
- Okay.

30:04.370 --> 30:05.671
- And I hate to break it to you,

30:05.672 --> 30:07.474
but guess who's
the listing agent?

30:08.408 --> 30:11.310

- Josh.

30:11.311 --> 30:13.612

30:13.613 --> 30:16.815

Hello?

30:18.485 --> 30:20.753
- Hello?
- Just walk through the door.

30:20.754 --> 30:22.688
Just come through
the side, over here.

30:22.689 --> 30:26.658
- Oh, don't bother getting up.
- Sorry for bothering you.

30:26.659 --> 30:27.793
- Hi.

30:27.794 --> 30:28.794
I always mix up which one

30:28.795 --> 30:30.300
of the two daughters is who.

30:30.797 --> 30:32.498
- Oh. Good to
see you, too, Josh.

30:32.499 --> 30:36.735
- Flagg lives probably a
five-minute walk from my house,

30:36.736 --> 30:39.138
<i>and, like, I, for some
reason, just find it</i>

30:39.139 --> 30:40.539
a little bit charming

30:40.540 --> 30:42.508
that he likes to spend
so much time with me.

30:42.509 --> 30:46.459
This is my beautiful
firstborn daughter Juliet.

30:46.460 --> 30:47.980
- No. Your firstborn is Jake.

30:47.981 --> 30:50.159
- Oh, Jesus.
- Okay.

30:50.160 --> 30:53.189
- Jules is not a big fan.

30:53.190 --> 30:57.823
Josh is not really accustomed
to being around children,

30:57.824 --> 31:01.393
and that's because most
of his friends are north of 70.

31:01.394 --> 31:03.629
- So do I have to actually
take you on a tour?

31:03.630 --> 31:04.330
Can I just, like...
- Josh.

31:04.331 --> 31:05.764
- Make myself at
home and let you--

31:05.765 --> 31:07.166
- Take us on a tour.
Make us feel special.

31:07.167 --> 31:08.801
I love a Spanish.

31:08.802 --> 31:11.709
<i>- Gorgeous 1920s Spanish house.</i>

31:11.710 --> 31:12.738
<i>Look at the wood beams.
They're phenomenal.</i>

31:12.739 --> 31:14.739
<i>- I actually do love the beams.</i>

31:14.740 --> 31:15.208
<i>- Aren't those great?</i>

31:15.209 --> 31:16.675
- Don't you think they're cool?
- Yeah.

31:16.676 --> 31:18.210
<i>- I would actually lighten them.</i>

31:18.211 --> 31:19.812
<i>- Ooh, I would too.</i>

31:19.813 --> 31:22.815
<i>- My clients on Hillcrest
bought the property last year,</i>

31:22.816 --> 31:25.718
got an architect, went
to town with plans,

31:25.719 --> 31:27.252
<i>decided to do a full remodel,</i>

31:27.253 --> 31:28.821
<i>and then decided, a
couple months ago,</i>

31:28.822 --> 31:30.899
they didn't want
to deal with it.

31:30.900 --> 31:31.909
And I'll just tell you
everything I would

31:31.910 --> 31:32.158
and would not do with the house.

31:32.159 --> 31:33.359
<i>I would lighten the floors.</i>

31:33.360 --> 31:34.894
<i>- Big shock. So would I.
- Okay.</i>

31:36.529 --> 31:40.132
- I'm glad the three of us fit
under here, but not many more.

31:40.133 --> 31:42.768
- Oh, my gosh.

31:42.769 --> 31:44.870
<i>- Wow. This is good for us.</i>

31:44.871 --> 31:47.806
- I can bake on huge scales.

31:47.807 --> 31:49.375
<i>- What are we
thinking about the floor?</i>

31:49.376 --> 31:52.211
<i>- I would rip out
all of those floors</i>

31:52.212 --> 31:55.214
and have them all be
like a European oak.

31:55.215 --> 31:56.949
- When you say
"all of those floors,"

31:56.950 --> 31:58.150
what are you referring to?

31:58.151 --> 32:00.552
- The entire house.
<i>- Selling 101.</i>

32:00.553 --> 32:02.454
I know that this house
needs a lot of work,

32:02.455 --> 32:04.289
<i>so she can't use that excuse,</i>

32:04.290 --> 32:06.919
"But it needs work! But-da-da."

32:06.920 --> 32:08.293
<i>I'm gonna tell her
that it needs work,</i>

32:08.294 --> 32:10.897
and that way, I am taking
all her leverage away.

32:13.233 --> 32:14.767
This is, I think,
gonna be used a lot.

32:14.768 --> 32:16.268
- Wow. Look at
the palm trees. It's...

32:16.269 --> 32:17.469
- Yeah.
- Like, so quintessential--

32:17.470 --> 32:18.804
- I see this whole situation.

32:18.805 --> 32:20.139
- I love it.
- During summer...

32:20.140 --> 32:21.473
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be really fun.

32:21.474 --> 32:22.975
- This is gonna be
perfect for me and Jake.

32:22.976 --> 32:25.780
Especially, like,
in the summertime.

32:27.614 --> 32:29.148
<i>- Pool's big enough.</i>

32:29.149 --> 32:31.617
I think what I need to
do is go up here, Josh...

32:31.618 --> 32:32.818
<i>- Okay.
- And do, like,</i>

32:32.819 --> 32:34.486
<i>a great gym/guest house.
- Okay.</i>

32:34.487 --> 32:36.722
- And then all of
this becomes garage,

32:36.723 --> 32:40.125
which is gonna cost
another 400 grand.

32:40.126 --> 32:43.796
So now, I've redone the
floors in the entire first floor

32:43.797 --> 32:47.933
for roughly 50,000.
Tweaking on the kitchen. 25...

32:47.934 --> 32:49.601
- We're up to about
600. I've been adding.

32:49.602 --> 32:51.670
- The stairs. You're
doing a real good job

32:51.671 --> 32:53.105
about talking me
out of the house...

32:53.106 --> 32:54.506
instead of into it.
- Trust me,

32:54.507 --> 32:56.141
everything I'm
doing has a reason.

32:56.142 --> 32:58.344
After escrow, you'll
understand why.

32:58.345 --> 32:59.746
- Oh, I will, will I?
- Oh, okay.

33:02.649 --> 33:05.351
<i>- This is the largest of the
guest rooms in the house.</i>

33:05.352 --> 33:08.354
- Dibs. I call it. This is mine.

33:08.355 --> 33:10.322
<i>- Look at this bath.</i>

33:10.323 --> 33:13.159
- This is gonna work.
I think it'll be just fine.

33:14.127 --> 33:15.427
<i>- Now it's the main bedroom.</i>

33:15.428 --> 33:18.430
<i>- Okay, so this is
plenty big for me.</i>

33:18.431 --> 33:20.165
- Okay, so now, this is great.
- God.

33:20.166 --> 33:24.337
To have a closet back would
be such a wonderful thing.

be the king of Bel Air,

41:22.182 --> 41:25.150
<i>or I'm nothing, I'm just
a broker from New York.</i>

41:25.151 --> 41:28.421
I have to get this deal done.

41:28.888 --> 41:31.391
<i>- Hey, Fredrik.</i>
- Hi.

41:33.760 --> 41:37.963
- They're going to
accept 16. All the furniture.

41:37.964 --> 41:40.532
Probably worth
$500,000-$600,000.

41:40.533 --> 41:44.371
All the art, with the
exception of the sculptures.

41:50.443 --> 41:51.844
- Love, you and I
are not art dealers.

41:51.845 --> 41:53.213
If she wants
sculptures, we will--

41:54.381 --> 41:56.115
- Listen, I will,
after the closing,

41:56.116 --> 41:59.184
put her in touch with
biggest art dealer in the world.

41:59.185 --> 42:01.320
They're giving you
basically 500,000--maybe

42:01.321 --> 42:04.857
$600,000-$700,000 worth of
furniture and art, for nothing.

42:04.858 --> 42:07.226
That's included in
the price, at 16 million.

42:07.227 --> 42:08.827
You're getting that.

42:08.828 --> 42:11.230
- She's been
painting... since the '50s.

42:11.231 --> 42:13.165
Literally, she started
in Diego Rivera's studio.

42:13.166 --> 42:14.667
- Wow.
- And with Frida Kahlo.

42:14.668 --> 42:16.335
That's why he's named
Diego, by the way.

42:16.336 --> 42:18.705
- Jeez, so this is
a whole story then.

42:21.374 --> 42:24.943
- I had a client one time
that the whole deal blew up,

42:24.944 --> 42:28.809
because of a chandelier.
The egos get involved,

42:28.810 --> 42:30.349
and it's our job to sometimes
try to calm them down.

42:30.350 --> 42:33.185
And by the way, let's
forget about these sculptures

42:33.186 --> 42:34.888
and talk about the house.

42:37.991 --> 42:40.929
- Okay. I'll wait here.

42:40.930 --> 42:42.161
<i>If I sell Donella
for 16 million,</i>

42:42.162 --> 42:45.364
it would actually be a
record for Upper Bel Air,

42:45.365 --> 42:48.367
<i>and I've been struggling with
this property since day one.</i>

42:48.368 --> 42:51.937
<i>So to arrive here just to
have the whole thing explode,</i>

42:51.938 --> 42:56.375
just because of sculptures,
I would never forgive myself.

42:56.376 --> 42:58.277
- No, I know.
- Guys?

42:58.278 --> 42:59.745
Did you have a
nice chat about art?

42:59.746 --> 43:02.281
- He's great. We understand
why you married him.

43:02.282 --> 43:03.782
I don't know if the
other way around, but...

43:03.783 --> 43:05.384
- Really?
- We'll find out.

43:05.385 --> 43:07.653
- That's so rude.
- Shooting. Just, "Pow. Pow."

43:07.654 --> 43:10.823
- Well, maybe you want
to marry me when I tell you

43:10.824 --> 43:15.627
that I got over ask $5,000,
including all the furniture,

43:15.628 --> 43:19.164
all the art, excluding
the sculptures.

43:19.165 --> 43:20.899
- There you go.
- So none of the sculptures?

43:20.900 --> 43:22.101
- None of 'em?
- None of them.

43:22.102 --> 43:25.709
- That's good. Okay. Done.

43:25.710 --> 43:26.806
- Do we have a deal?
- We have a deal.

43:27.574 --> 43:30.377
- Congratulations! Ahh!

43:31.311 --> 43:32.444
- Get in here.

43:32.445 --> 43:34.747
- We did it. I did it. I did it.

43:34.748 --> 43:36.382
- Thank you so much.
- This is amazing.

43:36.383 --> 43:37.583
- I like your media.
- Aren't you happy?

43:37.584 --> 43:38.817
Aren't you smiling?

43:38.818 --> 43:40.419
- This deal is yours.
- Wow.

43:40.420 --> 43:41.754
This is a record
for Upper Bel Air.

43:41.755 --> 43:43.322
<i>Congrats.</i>

43:43.323 --> 43:46.458
<i>- Next time, on "Million
Dollar Listing Los Angeles"...</i>

43:46.459 --> 43:49.795
- Lexi, Ace, do you want
Juju and Zeta to stay longer?

43:49.796 --> 43:52.979
- Yeah!
- Yay!

43:52.980 --> 43:54.800
- Is it crazy if we
bought them a home,

43:54.801 --> 43:56.469
to be around the grandchildren?

43:59.172 --> 44:02.749
- My lovely, lovely clients
Felisha and Harv have decided

44:02.750 --> 44:04.511
<i>they are ready
to write an offer.</i>

44:10.500 --> 44:12.519
- No. Oh, no. (BLEEP).

44:12.520 --> 44:15.154
- I texted you three
times about Hillcrest,

44:15.155 --> 44:17.569
<i>because I think I'm
gonna write an offer.</i>

44:17.570 --> 44:18.324
I'm mad at you!

44:18.325 --> 44:20.125
- You're being
----ing ridiculous.

44:20.126 --> 44:21.494
- Get me a counter!
