WEBVTT

01:06.546 --> 01:11.050
THE LAST OF US

01:59.808 --> 02:05.104
10 MILES WEST OF BOSTON

02:27.252 --> 02:28.795
You want your jacket back?

02:55.321 --> 02:57.240
I've never been in the woods.

03:00.785 --> 03:02.328
More bugs than I thought.

03:08.334 --> 03:10.044
- Look, I've been thinking about--
- I don't want your sorries.

03:10.044 --> 03:11.713
I wasn't gonna say I'm sorry.

03:11.713 --> 03:14.841
I was gonna say that I've been
thinking about what happened.

03:14.841 --> 03:17.218
Nobody made you or Tess take me.

03:17.218 --> 03:19.137
Nobody made you go along with this plan.

03:19.137 --> 03:21.514
You needed a truck battery or whatever

03:21.514 --> 03:23.391
and you made a choice.

03:23.391 --> 03:27.020
So don't blame me
for something that isn't my fault.

03:50.919 --> 03:52.462
How much longer?

03:53.254 --> 03:54.797
Five-hour hike.

03:56.382 --> 03:57.717
We can manage that.

04:25.286 --> 04:26.913
You've gone this way a lot?

04:27.538 --> 04:30.124
- No Infected?
- Not often, no.

04:30.124 --> 04:31.459
What are you looking out for?

04:32.460 --> 04:33.294
People.

04:34.379 --> 04:37.674
- Are Bill and Frank nice?
- Frank is.

04:39.717 --> 04:41.636
How'd you get that scar on your head?

04:42.178 --> 04:43.346
What? Is it something lame?

04:43.346 --> 04:45.181
Like you fell down the stairs
or something?

04:45.181 --> 04:47.517
- I didn't fall down any stairs.
- Okay, so what then?

04:48.184 --> 04:49.769
Someone shot at me and missed.

04:49.769 --> 04:51.396
See, that's cool.

04:51.938 --> 04:53.398
You shoot back?

04:53.398 --> 04:55.233
- Yeah.
- You get him?

04:55.984 --> 04:57.443
No, I missed, too.

04:57.443 --> 04:59.988
It happens more often than you think.

04:59.988 --> 05:02.323
'Cause you suck at shooting
or, like, in general?

05:05.451 --> 05:07.078
In general.

05:13.918 --> 05:15.503
You know, seeing as
it's just the two of us,

05:15.503 --> 05:17.505
- I was thinking I should pro--
- No.

05:26.514 --> 05:29.058
Cumberland Farms.

05:31.185 --> 05:32.145
Hang back a minute.

05:32.145 --> 05:33.354
I gotta grab some stuff I stashed.

05:33.354 --> 05:34.522
CUMBERLAND
FARMS

05:34.522 --> 05:35.732
Stashed?

05:35.732 --> 05:36.983
Why do you have stuff stashed here?

05:36.983 --> 05:39.193
You ask a lot of goddamn questions.

05:39.193 --> 05:41.029
Yes, I do.

05:43.865 --> 05:46.993
So, are you gonna answer me or what?

05:48.327 --> 05:49.829
We hide supplies on routes

05:49.829 --> 05:51.789
in case we find ourselves
short on gear,

05:51.789 --> 05:55.334
- which I currently am 'cause--
- No way!

05:57.503 --> 05:58.546
You ever play this one?

05:58.546 --> 05:59.589
MORTAL KOMBAT II

05:59.589 --> 06:01.799
I had a friend who knew
everything about this game.

06:01.799 --> 06:04.218
There's this one character
named Mileena who takes off her mask

06:04.218 --> 06:06.721
and she has monster teeth
and then she swallows you whole

06:06.721 --> 06:08.139
and barfs out your bones.

06:09.682 --> 06:11.434
Oh, man.

06:14.645 --> 06:15.521
LIFESAVERS

06:15.521 --> 06:16.606
You forgot where you put your stuff.

06:17.273 --> 06:19.901
No, I'm just zeroing in on it.

06:19.901 --> 06:22.695
- It's been a couple of years.
- Okay, well, I'm gonna

06:22.695 --> 06:25.031
take a look around,
see if there's anything good.

06:25.031 --> 06:26.866
Trust me,
it's all been picked over already.

06:26.866 --> 06:28.659
Maybe, maybe not.

06:30.119 --> 06:32.497
- Is there anything bad in here?
- Just you.

06:33.498 --> 06:34.791
Getting funnier.

06:37.960 --> 06:38.878
Fuck.

07:12.537 --> 07:14.664
- You all right back there?
- Yep!

08:20.646 --> 08:22.023
TAMPAX
PEARL

08:22.023 --> 08:23.357
Fuck yeah.

10:22.143 --> 10:23.060
Ellie?

10:30.901 --> 10:31.819
Ellie!

10:39.076 --> 10:40.161
NO
SMOKING

10:40.161 --> 10:41.078
Ellie?

10:43.414 --> 10:45.333
Picked over, my ass.

10:50.254 --> 10:51.881
TAMPAX
PEARL

10:59.096 --> 11:00.890
What are you doing?

11:00.890 --> 11:03.392
There's not much ammo
out there for this thing.

11:03.392 --> 11:04.894
Makes it mostly useless.

11:04.894 --> 11:06.896
Well, if you're just gonna leave it there.

11:08.939 --> 11:10.066
No.

11:24.038 --> 11:26.582
Holy shit.

11:30.211 --> 11:32.171
You fly in one of those?

11:32.171 --> 11:34.799
- Few times, sure.
- So lucky.

11:35.341 --> 11:37.426
Didn't feel like it at the time.

11:37.426 --> 11:40.388
Get shoved into a middle seat,
pay 12 bucks for a sandwich.

11:40.388 --> 11:43.015
Dude, you got to go up in the sky.

11:45.267 --> 11:46.602
Yeah, well, so did they.

11:52.358 --> 11:53.901
Grim.

11:55.569 --> 11:58.155
So everything came
crashing down in one day?

11:58.155 --> 11:59.824
- Pretty much.
- How?

12:00.866 --> 12:02.785
I mean, no one was infected
with Cordyceps,

12:02.785 --> 12:04.078
everybody's fine,

12:04.078 --> 12:07.206
eating in restaurants
and flying in planes.

12:07.206 --> 12:09.708
And then, all at once?

12:09.708 --> 12:11.460
How did it even start?

12:11.460 --> 12:13.504
If you have to get bit to be infected,

12:13.504 --> 12:15.881
then who bit the first person?

12:15.881 --> 12:17.508
Was it a monkey?
I bet it was a monkey.

12:17.508 --> 12:19.427
It wasn't a monkey.
I thought you went to school.

12:19.427 --> 12:20.886
FEDRA school.

12:20.886 --> 12:23.180
They don't teach us
how their shitty government

12:23.180 --> 12:25.015
failed to prevent a pandemic.

12:28.602 --> 12:32.523
No one knows for sure,
but, best guess,

12:33.357 --> 12:35.109
Cordyceps mutated.

12:35.734 --> 12:37.695
And some of it got into the food supply.

12:37.695 --> 12:40.698
Probably a basic ingredient
like flour or sugar.

12:41.907 --> 12:43.868
There were certain brands of food
that were sold everywhere,

12:43.868 --> 12:45.995
all across the country, across the world.

12:45.995 --> 12:49.999
Bread, cereal, pancake mix.

12:51.834 --> 12:54.378
You eat enough of it,
it'll get you infected.

12:56.005 --> 12:58.382
So the tainted food
all hits the store shelves

12:58.382 --> 13:00.217
around the same time, Thursday.

13:01.010 --> 13:04.972
People bought it,
ate some Thursday night or Friday morning.

13:04.972 --> 13:08.476
Day goes on, they started to get sick.

13:08.476 --> 13:12.480
Afternoon, evening, they got worse.

13:14.857 --> 13:16.775
Then they started bitin'.

13:18.861 --> 13:21.780
Friday night, September 26, 2003.

13:25.201 --> 13:27.286
And by Monday, everything was gone.

13:34.752 --> 13:36.879
It makes more sense
than monkeys.

13:37.880 --> 13:38.797
Thanks.

13:41.217 --> 13:42.134
Sure.

13:45.888 --> 13:46.805
What?

13:47.848 --> 13:50.976
- We'll cut across the woods here.
- Isn't the road easier?

13:52.061 --> 13:53.687
Yeah, it's just--

13:53.687 --> 13:56.065
There's stuff up there you shouldn't see.

13:56.065 --> 13:59.860
- Well, now I have to see.
- I don't want you to.

14:00.319 --> 14:02.196
Serious. Ellie.

14:02.196 --> 14:03.906
Can it hurt me?

14:03.906 --> 14:04.907
No.

14:06.408 --> 14:08.202
You're too honest, man.

14:08.202 --> 14:10.204
Should've said axe murderer.

14:16.585 --> 14:18.128
Whatever it was,

14:18.671 --> 14:20.214
think it's gone.

14:41.318 --> 14:43.862
About a week after Outbreak Day, soldiers

14:45.906 --> 14:48.826
went through the countryside,
evacuated the small towns.

14:50.119 --> 14:53.038
Told you you were goin' to a QZ,
and you were,

14:53.914 --> 14:55.457
if there was room.

14:57.293 --> 14:58.836
If there wasn't.

15:07.511 --> 15:09.430
These people weren't sick?

15:09.888 --> 15:11.807
No, probably not.

15:15.894 --> 15:17.438
Why kill them?

15:18.731 --> 15:20.649
Why not just leave 'em be?

15:21.191 --> 15:23.736
Dead people can't be infected.

15:35.789 --> 15:39.793
SEPTEMBER 30th, 2003

15:49.386 --> 15:51.597
Mommy's here. Mommy's here.

16:21.502 --> 16:24.296
No, sir. We're in the basement now.
There's no one here.

16:24.296 --> 16:26.298
<i>Let's check back with the others.</i>

- No.
- Why did you take that long to answer?

22:10.851 --> 22:12.144
I don't know.

22:13.061 --> 22:14.604
I thought about lying for some reason,

22:14.604 --> 22:17.232
but a reason didn't come.

22:17.899 --> 22:20.694
Look, I'm just trying to get to Boston.

22:20.694 --> 22:21.903
Alone?

22:23.447 --> 22:24.865
We started with 10.

22:25.449 --> 22:26.908
But yeah, I'm alone.

22:26.908 --> 22:28.326
From where?

22:28.326 --> 22:30.245
Baltimore QZ.

22:31.079 --> 22:32.622
It's gone.

22:35.417 --> 22:36.752
Are ya hurt?

22:38.128 --> 22:40.005
There's just a bruise.

22:51.933 --> 22:53.477
Oh fuck.

23:12.496 --> 23:13.330
Stop there.

23:19.586 --> 23:20.504
How'd you get that?

23:45.403 --> 23:46.655
Boston is that way.

23:47.572 --> 23:51.159
- You can make it by nightfall.
- I'm really hungry.

23:51.159 --> 23:52.786
I haven't eaten in two days.

23:55.747 --> 23:58.291
It doesn't sound very
long out loud, does it?

23:59.459 --> 24:01.962
- It feels long.
- I'm letting you go, so go.

24:01.962 --> 24:03.588
All right, look.

24:04.631 --> 24:06.383
- First, my name's Frank--
- Oh, yeah?

24:06.383 --> 24:07.801
Here's the thing, Frank.

24:07.801 --> 24:10.637
If I feed you,
then every bum you talk to about it

24:10.637 --> 24:13.598
is gonna show up here
lookin' for a free lunch,

24:13.598 --> 24:15.809
and this is not an Arby's.

24:16.810 --> 24:19.729
Well, Arby's didn't have free lunch.
It was a restaurant.

24:22.774 --> 24:28.697
I won't talk about it to any bums,
or hobos or vagabonds, I promise.

24:35.704 --> 24:38.623
You already know I'm bad at lying.

25:15.076 --> 25:17.204
I left some clothes here for ya.

25:18.705 --> 25:20.040
What?

25:20.665 --> 25:21.791
Clothes!

25:22.250 --> 25:24.794
Thank you! Almost done.

25:26.504 --> 25:29.090
Although can I have five more minutes?

25:29.090 --> 25:30.091
Sure.

25:30.717 --> 25:32.135
Sure!

25:32.135 --> 25:35.347
Thank you! This is amazing!

27:05.478 --> 27:06.604
What the fuck?

27:07.939 --> 27:10.108
Everything tastes good
when you're starving.

27:10.108 --> 27:12.319
Yeah, but not like this.

My God.

27:28.668 --> 27:30.879
I know I don't seem like the type.

27:31.963 --> 27:33.089
No, you do.

28:06.206 --> 28:08.708
- There is more, if--
- No, I can't.

28:09.667 --> 28:11.461
I want to, believe me.

28:11.461 --> 28:12.379
But...

28:15.590 --> 28:16.758
Thank you.

28:21.388 --> 28:22.514
Thank you.

28:26.184 --> 28:27.519
You're welcome.

28:37.695 --> 28:40.031
So, I guess I'll be going then.

28:48.665 --> 28:49.999
But first.

28:55.255 --> 28:57.424
I've been staring at this the whole time.

28:57.424 --> 29:00.135
- Is it antique?
- 1948.

29:00.135 --> 29:01.136
Wow.

29:01.136 --> 29:03.054
You know how much these are worth?

29:03.054 --> 29:04.764
Currently, nothing.

29:06.266 --> 29:09.602
"Fur Elise." "Tales of Hoffmann"?
Yuck.

29:09.602 --> 29:12.772
- These aren't yours.
- My mother's. Could you not--

29:13.565 --> 29:14.858
This is you.

29:20.488 --> 29:23.408
Oh, my God, It's my favorite.

29:25.702 --> 29:28.830
THE BEST OF LINDA RONSTADT

30:01.446 --> 30:04.741
No. No. No, no, no, no.
No, thank you. Sorry.

30:04.741 --> 30:08.203
- Not this song. Not this song.
- Well, I'm not a professional.

30:08.203 --> 30:09.829
Well, neither am I, but--

30:16.961 --> 30:18.505
And then I'll leave.

32:05.945 --> 32:08.072
So, who's the girl?

32:09.365 --> 32:11.284
Girl you're singing about?

32:14.287 --> 32:15.830
There is no girl.

32:20.668 --> 32:22.003
I know.

32:57.246 --> 32:58.790
What's your name?

33:02.335 --> 33:03.252
Bill.

33:13.262 --> 33:15.181
Go take a shower, Bill.

33:16.224 --> 33:17.558
Okay.

34:39.599 --> 34:41.726
Have you ever done this before?

34:43.102 --> 34:44.645
Not with anyone?

34:46.230 --> 34:49.358
- With a girl a long time ago--
- Yeah, I know, so.

34:51.652 --> 34:54.447
I'm gonna start with the simple things.

34:56.199 --> 34:58.326
- Okay.
- Okay.

35:00.119 --> 35:04.040
But before I do, I want you to know
that I'm not a whore.

35:06.042 --> 35:10.171
I don't have sex for lunches,

35:11.839 --> 35:13.758
not even great ones.

35:18.054 --> 35:20.014
So, if I do this,

35:20.014 --> 35:23.643
I am gonna stay for a few more days.

35:25.937 --> 35:27.271
Is that okay?

35:27.730 --> 35:28.940
Yeah.

35:28.940 --> 35:29.941
Yes.

36:06.644 --> 36:07.979
Fuck you!

36:07.979 --> 36:08.938
Come on!

36:08.938 --> 36:09.939
THREE YEARS LATER 2010

36:09.939 --> 36:11.649
Hey! Would you stop?

36:11.649 --> 36:13.943
Do I ask for things? Ever?

36:15.027 --> 36:16.195
Why am I even saying that?

36:16.195 --> 36:18.322
This isn't for me.
This is for us.

36:18.322 --> 36:19.740
Who cares what they look like?

36:19.740 --> 36:21.158
I do!

36:21.659 --> 36:23.619
Our home isn't just our house.

36:23.619 --> 36:25.037
It's everything around us!

36:25.037 --> 36:28.332
- Give me a fuckin' break!
- I'm sorry, I forgot.

36:28.332 --> 36:29.792
I live in this world.

36:29.792 --> 36:33.045
You live in a psycho bunker
where 9/11 was an inside job

36:33.045 --> 36:35.089
and the government are all Nazis.

36:35.089 --> 36:39.594
- The government are all Nazis!
- Well, yeah, now! But not then!

36:44.515 --> 36:46.684
I am asking for some paint

36:46.684 --> 36:48.561
and some gasoline for the lawnmower.

36:48.561 --> 36:50.938
That's all.
I'll do everything else myself.

36:50.938 --> 36:53.941
- It is not a mat--
- Bill, if you say "resource management,"

36:53.941 --> 36:56.944
so help me,
I will run through one of your trip wires.

37:02.033 --> 37:03.409
Okay, okay.

37:05.161 --> 37:07.705
- Just tell me why.
- I did.

37:08.789 --> 37:11.125
Paying attention to things,

37:12.043 --> 37:14.378
it's how we show love.

37:15.588 --> 37:17.423
This is my street, too.

37:18.215 --> 37:20.801
Just let me love it the way I want to.

37:23.638 --> 37:25.890
And I'm fixing up some of the shops.

37:27.183 --> 37:28.225
Not the stupid ones.

37:28.225 --> 37:31.228
Just the wine shop
and the furniture store.

37:32.521 --> 37:34.065
And the clothing boutique.

37:35.149 --> 37:36.484
The boutique?

37:37.360 --> 37:39.904
Are we hosting
formal garden parties now?

37:39.904 --> 37:41.113
No.

37:42.698 --> 37:45.034
But we are gonna have friends.

37:47.620 --> 37:48.955
Excuse me?

37:52.291 --> 37:53.876
We're gonna make friends,

37:53.876 --> 37:56.629
and we will invite them to visit.

37:58.839 --> 38:03.511
We don't have friends, Frank.

38:03.511 --> 38:07.890
We will never have friends
because there are no friends to be had.

38:07.890 --> 38:10.643
Well, I've actually
been talking to a nice woman on the radio.

38:12.687 --> 38:14.230
You what?

38:14.730 --> 38:17.316
Well, this really is just-- it's amazing.

38:17.316 --> 38:18.192
Right?

38:18.901 --> 38:20.027
Can you not, please?

38:25.574 --> 38:28.577
- I'm the same way.
- You're a paranoid schizophrenic, too?

38:28.577 --> 38:30.413
I'm not schizophrenic.

38:35.501 --> 38:39.714
Well, can I just say, gun aside,
which I get, by the way,

38:40.214 --> 38:44.385
how nice this is to have a civilized meal
in such a beautiful place?

38:44.385 --> 38:46.220
It's been so long.

38:46.220 --> 38:48.347
I mean, I wanna thank you.

38:48.347 --> 38:50.808
Even if we don't end up working together.

38:50.808 --> 38:52.226
I really needed this.

38:52.685 --> 38:54.437
We are working together.

38:58.566 --> 38:59.692
We are.

39:01.694 --> 39:03.738
You know what? Let's go inside.

39:03.738 --> 39:04.780
Tess, I wanna show you something.

39:04.780 --> 39:07.033
- I have been wanting to see inside.
- Bring your wine.

39:07.033 --> 39:07.992
- Not inside.
- Thank you.

39:07.992 --> 39:09.201
- Yes.
- Frank.

39:09.201 --> 39:10.161
Frank!

39:20.963 --> 39:21.964
I understand.

39:23.007 --> 39:24.008
If my,

39:26.385 --> 39:27.344
if mine,

39:30.264 --> 39:33.851
brought strangers into our situation,
I wouldn't be happy either.

39:33.851 --> 39:36.312
But of all the people
he could've found on the radio,

39:36.312 --> 39:39.065
we're actually
decent people just tryin' to get by.

39:41.025 --> 39:42.735
Well, aren't I the lucky one?

39:42.735 --> 39:44.779
There's stuff we have in the QZ
that you don't have here.

39:46.072 --> 39:48.783
Books, medicine, machine parts.

39:48.783 --> 39:52.119
We can help each other,
and get that gun outta my face.

40:02.671 --> 40:04.590
So, what, you were a

40:06.425 --> 40:08.219
prepper or somethin'?

40:08.219 --> 40:09.845
"Survivalist."

40:10.805 --> 40:13.682
Maybe you are decent people, maybe not.

40:13.682 --> 40:14.683
Doesn't matter.

40:15.226 --> 40:16.977
We're self-sufficient here.

40:18.229 --> 40:22.775
I don't need you or your friend
complicating our lives.

40:23.317 --> 40:24.860
Is that clear?

40:27.863 --> 40:29.990
That fence has got a year on it, tops.

40:31.534 --> 40:34.078
Galvanized wire
already started to corrode.

40:36.247 --> 40:39.166
I can get you 10 spools
of high-tensile aluminum.

40:39.917 --> 40:41.669
Last you the rest of your life.

40:45.089 --> 40:46.215
Lives.

40:51.011 --> 40:54.265
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah. It's not a gift.

40:54.265 --> 40:56.475
- You'll come back, we'll trade.
- All right.

40:56.475 --> 40:58.769
And I had this idea that we should

40:58.769 --> 41:01.522
use codes for the radio
in case anyone's listening.

41:01.522 --> 41:03.399
That's a good idea.
Like, with what?

41:03.399 --> 41:05.401
I was thinking, like, the decades.

41:05.401 --> 41:08.279
- Like, '80s, trouble, of course.
- Yeah.

41:08.279 --> 41:10.197
'70s...

41:10.197 --> 41:12.199
FEDRA's never gonna come up here.

41:13.325 --> 41:15.870
And you're well-protected
against stray Infected.

41:17.454 --> 41:21.000
But sooner or later, there'll be raiders.

41:21.959 --> 41:24.795
And they'll beat that fence
and your tripwires.

41:24.795 --> 41:26.755
They'll come at night,

41:26.755 --> 41:28.757
quiet and armed.

41:33.220 --> 41:34.763
We'll be fine.

41:53.532 --> 41:56.744
THREE YEARS LATER 2013

42:02.082 --> 42:06.462
- Pick it up.
- Hey, I can't.

42:06.462 --> 42:08.464
Just one more loop around.

42:08.923 --> 42:10.716
I got something to show you.

42:12.968 --> 42:14.011
Not that.

42:19.892 --> 42:21.268
Nearly there.

42:24.688 --> 42:25.898
You can make it.

42:27.733 --> 42:28.609
What?

42:28.609 --> 42:30.319
It's okay.

42:31.904 --> 42:34.031
- Ready?
- Yes.

42:41.956 --> 42:45.125
I traded Joel and Tess
one of your guns for a packet of seeds.

42:46.168 --> 42:47.503
Which gun?

42:48.712 --> 42:50.047
A little one.

43:44.184 --> 43:45.519
I'm sorry.

43:47.062 --> 43:48.188
For what?

43:51.233 --> 43:52.860
Gettin' older faster than you.

43:53.569 --> 43:54.945
I like you older.

43:57.489 --> 43:59.408
Older means we're still here.

44:05.581 --> 44:06.498
What?

44:10.294 --> 44:13.213
I was never afraid before you showed up.

44:29.563 --> 44:32.941
Not on the strawberries.

44:32.941 --> 44:33.942
Right.

45:11.146 --> 45:11.980
Shit.

45:15.943 --> 45:16.902
Bill!

45:18.278 --> 45:19.071
Bill!

45:21.031 --> 45:21.949
Bill?

45:22.616 --> 45:23.409
Bill!

46:02.906 --> 46:04.867
Bill! Bill!

46:04.867 --> 46:06.160
Get inside!

46:11.415 --> 46:13.709
- No!
- We gotta get you inside.

46:13.709 --> 46:18.046
- No! No! No!
- Bill, inside, now! Hold on to me.

46:18.046 --> 46:20.674
I gotcha. I gotcha.

46:25.095 --> 46:26.096
Okay.

46:29.183 --> 46:30.517
There we go.

46:32.352 --> 46:35.189
Okay, okay. We got this.

46:35.189 --> 46:36.648
We got this.

46:36.648 --> 46:38.066
You hold your hand there for me?

46:38.066 --> 46:39.902
Hold, hold your hand there.

46:43.572 --> 46:44.448
Frank.

46:46.200 --> 46:47.367
- Frank!
- I'm right here.

46:47.367 --> 46:49.369
- Frank, leave the gas on!
- I'm right here.

46:49.369 --> 46:51.038
- I'm right here. I'm right here.
- Leave the gas on.

46:51.038 --> 46:53.415
The fence,
the fence'll kill the rest of 'em.

46:53.415 --> 46:54.833
Okay, yep.

46:55.584 --> 46:56.960
I made a list for you.

46:58.337 --> 46:59.463
Tell me about the list.

46:59.463 --> 47:02.090
I have copies of all the keys.

47:02.090 --> 47:03.300
Good.

47:05.219 --> 47:07.221
Call Joel.

47:08.764 --> 47:10.557
You can't be here alone.

47:10.557 --> 47:12.267
Well, I'm not alone.

47:12.267 --> 47:14.061
- You're here.
- No.

47:14.895 --> 47:16.271
Call Joel.

47:16.271 --> 47:19.691
- Okay, here we go.
- No.

47:19.691 --> 47:22.694
- It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
- Call Joel. Call Joel.

47:26.490 --> 47:29.368
- He'll take care of ya.
- There we go.

47:37.918 --> 47:39.044
Okay.

47:40.128 --> 47:41.213
Okay.

47:49.805 --> 47:51.348
<i>Bill?</i>

47:53.850 --> 47:54.768
Bill.

47:58.939 --> 48:00.107
It's getting cold.

48:00.107 --> 48:01.400
Okay.

48:01.400 --> 48:03.402
- Let me bring ya inside.
- Yeah.

48:09.449 --> 48:10.867
Okay. There we go.

48:10.867 --> 48:13.620
TEN YEARS LATER 2023

48:14.663 --> 48:15.747
Okay?

48:16.540 --> 48:19.084
- We'll get you warmed up.
- Yeah.

49:39.373 --> 49:41.917
- Did you take your pills?
- No.

50:02.729 --> 50:04.815
One orangey,

50:08.318 --> 50:12.656
a little whitey, and a big roundy.

51:19.765 --> 51:23.310
Took most of the night.
I'm exhausted.

51:24.144 --> 51:25.687
Goddamnit.

51:26.813 --> 51:28.356
You gotta be kidding me.

51:29.733 --> 51:31.526
I don't want you fallin' asleep
in the chair.

51:31.526 --> 51:33.820
- I won't.
- You will, and then your feet get blue.

51:33.820 --> 51:35.322
- Bill--
- I'm not fighting about it.

51:35.322 --> 51:37.699
- Back in bed.
- I promise you, I'm gonna stay up.

51:37.699 --> 51:40.702
- Why?
-'Cause this is my last day.

51:53.673 --> 51:54.591
What,

51:55.550 --> 51:56.927
what if we find a doctor?

51:56.927 --> 52:00.180
What if someone shows up who can help?

52:00.180 --> 52:03.767
Who's coming, Bill?
The door-to-door MRI salesman?

52:03.767 --> 52:08.230
There wasn't anything to cure this
before the world fell apart.

52:09.064 --> 52:10.816
I've made up my mind.

52:16.655 --> 52:17.572
Bill.

52:21.535 --> 52:22.577
Bill.

52:29.876 --> 52:31.002
Come here.

52:44.224 --> 52:45.684
Well, I'm not gonna give you the

52:45.684 --> 52:48.228
"every day was a wonderful gift from God"
speech.

52:48.228 --> 52:50.856
I've had a lot of bad days.

52:51.898 --> 52:53.817
I've had bad days with you, too.

52:56.403 --> 53:01.324
But I've had more good days with you
than with anyone else.

53:02.492 --> 53:05.036
Just give me one more good day.

53:09.207 --> 53:10.667
Starting now. Make me some toast.

53:14.713 --> 53:18.133
Then take me to the boutique,

53:18.925 --> 53:21.469
where I'll pick outfits for us.

53:21.970 --> 53:23.889
You'll wear what I ask,

53:26.933 --> 53:28.685
and we'll get married.

53:30.687 --> 53:33.231
And you'll cook a delicious dinner.

53:36.985 --> 53:38.904
Then you will crush all of these up,

53:39.654 --> 53:41.573
put them in my wine.

53:44.910 --> 53:46.536
I will drink it.

53:48.330 --> 53:50.874
Then you will take me by my hand,

53:51.708 --> 53:53.627
bring me to our bed,

53:57.505 --> 53:59.841
and I will fall asleep in your arms.

54:14.481 --> 54:16.107
I can't.

54:19.277 --> 54:20.612
Do you love me?

54:25.700 --> 54:26.618
Yes.

54:29.955 --> 54:32.290
Then love me the way I want you to.

54:56.398 --> 54:58.817
MAIN ST

55:01.236 --> 55:03.780
MAIN ST

56:48.843 --> 56:50.720
BEAUJOLAIS VILLAGES

59:01.434 --> 59:02.977
Will it be enough?

59:05.313 --> 59:06.314
Yeah.

59:51.776 --> 59:54.696
Were there already pills in the bottle?

59:55.989 --> 59:57.907
Enough to kill a horse.

1:00:00.034 --> 1:00:03.204
This isn't the tragic suicide
at the end of the play.

1:00:03.913 --> 1:00:05.039
I'm old.

1:00:07.667 --> 1:00:09.419
I'm satisfied.

1:00:12.797 --> 1:00:15.341
And you were my purpose.

1:00:24.892 --> 1:00:27.020
I do not support this.

1:00:28.604 --> 1:00:30.523
I should be furious.

1:00:33.943 --> 1:00:36.487
But from an objective point of view,

1:00:40.700 --> 1:00:42.827
it's incredibly romantic.

1:00:59.302 --> 1:01:00.845
Take me to bed.

1:02:09.580 --> 1:02:12.125
WELCOME TO LINCOLN
SETTLED IN 1764

1:02:22.468 --> 1:02:24.011
Stay there.

1:02:27.557 --> 1:02:31.185
DANGER
HIGH VOLTAGE

1:03:10.266 --> 1:03:13.186
- What the fuck?
- Bill?

1:03:16.481 --> 1:03:17.398
Frank?

1:03:21.861 --> 1:03:25.406
You stay there.
Ya hear anything, you see anything,

1:03:26.240 --> 1:03:27.158
yell.

1:03:27.867 --> 1:03:29.619
What if they're gone?

1:04:22.797 --> 1:04:23.714
Ellie?

1:04:32.848 --> 1:04:34.183
It's from Bill.

1:04:39.855 --> 1:04:42.692
"To whomever, but probably Joel."

1:04:43.693 --> 1:04:46.237
I figured I fell under "whomever."

1:04:47.530 --> 1:04:49.073
Came with this.

1:04:59.292 --> 1:05:00.543
So they're dead?

1:05:08.968 --> 1:05:10.720
You wanna?

1:05:12.972 --> 1:05:14.515
Go ahead. You do it.

1:05:19.854 --> 1:05:22.773
"August 29, 2023.

1:05:24.066 --> 1:05:27.278
"If you find this,
please do not come into the bedroom.

1:05:27.945 --> 1:05:30.615
"We left a window open
so the house wouldn't smell,

1:05:30.615 --> 1:05:32.617
"but it will probably be a sight.

1:05:33.451 --> 1:05:34.952
"I'm guessing you found this, Joel,

1:05:34.952 --> 1:05:37.038
"because anyone else
would've been electrocuted

1:05:37.038 --> 1:05:41.667
"or blown up by one of my traps. Hehehehehehehehe.

1:05:44.128 --> 1:05:45.671
"Take anything you need.

1:05:46.255 --> 1:05:49.091
"The bunker code is the same
as the gate code but in reverse.

1:05:49.925 --> 1:05:52.803
"Anyway, I never liked you,

1:05:52.803 --> 1:05:56.807
"but still,
it's like we're friends, almost.

1:05:57.350 --> 1:05:58.893
"And I respect you.

1:05:59.352 --> 1:06:01.729
"So, I'm gonna tell you something
because you're probably

1:06:01.729 --> 1:06:04.148
"the only person who will understand.

1:06:04.774 --> 1:06:08.319
"I used to hate the world
and I was happy when everyone died.

1:06:10.196 --> 1:06:15.117
"But I was wrong, because there was
one person worth saving.

1:06:16.202 --> 1:06:17.745
"That's what I did.

1:06:18.412 --> 1:06:19.747
"I saved him.

1:06:20.247 --> 1:06:21.791
"Then I protected him.

1:06:22.500 --> 1:06:25.169
"That's why men like you and me are here.

1:06:25.169 --> 1:06:27.004
"We have a job to do,

1:06:27.588 --> 1:06:30.925
"and God help any motherfuckers
who stand in our way.

1:06:32.802 --> 1:06:35.721
"I leave you all of my weapons
and equipment.

1:06:36.222 --> 1:06:37.765
Use them to keep--"

1:06:48.943 --> 1:06:53.447
TO KEEP TESS SAFE

1:06:59.787 --> 1:07:01.122
Stay here.

1:08:12.902 --> 1:08:15.571
SULF

1:08:27.458 --> 1:08:29.001
Show me your arm.

1:08:40.513 --> 1:08:41.889
I just finished makin' a truck battery.

1:08:41.889 --> 1:08:43.974
It's charging right now.

1:08:43.974 --> 1:08:46.435
- Okay.
- And I have a brother out in Wyoming.

1:08:46.435 --> 1:08:49.480
He's in some kinda trouble,
and I'm heading out there to find him.

1:08:50.272 --> 1:08:52.024
He used to be a Firefly.

1:08:52.775 --> 1:08:55.152
And my guess is he knows
where some of them are out there.

1:08:55.152 --> 1:08:57.446
Maybe they can get you
to wherever this lab is.

1:08:57.446 --> 1:08:58.656
All right.

1:09:01.116 --> 1:09:02.493
Listen, about Tess.

1:09:06.789 --> 1:09:09.750
If I'm takin' you with me,
there's some rules you gotta follow.

1:09:10.876 --> 1:09:13.087
Rule one, you don't bring up Tess. Ever.

1:09:13.671 --> 1:09:16.382
Matter of fact, we can just
keep our histories to ourselves.

1:09:16.382 --> 1:09:19.301
Rule two,
you don't tell anyone about your

1:09:20.302 --> 1:09:21.428
condition.

1:09:22.263 --> 1:09:24.139
They see that bite mark,
they won't think it through.

1:09:24.139 --> 1:09:25.891
They'll just shoot you.

1:09:25.891 --> 1:09:29.103
Rule three,
you do what I say when I say it.

1:09:29.103 --> 1:09:30.855
- We clear?
- Yes.

1:09:30.855 --> 1:09:32.147
Repeat it.

1:09:34.567 --> 1:09:36.318
What you say goes.

1:09:44.952 --> 1:09:46.036
Okay.

1:09:50.541 --> 1:09:51.584
So what now?

1:09:53.210 --> 1:09:55.087
We grab what we can.

1:10:04.638 --> 1:10:08.392
Ho-ly shit.

1:10:10.728 --> 1:10:12.354
This guy was a genius.

1:10:14.148 --> 1:10:15.900
Why was the music on?

1:10:15.900 --> 1:10:18.903
If he didn't reset the countdown
every few weeks,

1:10:18.903 --> 1:10:21.906
this playlist would run over the radio.

1:10:22.364 --> 1:10:23.282
'80s.

1:10:25.284 --> 1:10:26.827
Grab some cans from over there.

1:10:27.703 --> 1:10:30.247
Nothin' dented or swollen.

1:10:32.583 --> 1:10:33.918
- Dude.
- No.

1:10:36.170 --> 1:10:37.922
There's a wall of them.

1:10:57.149 --> 1:10:59.235
WOMAN'S SHIRTS
SM - MED

1:11:02.613 --> 1:11:04.490
ALL PURPOSE CHARGER

1:11:04.490 --> 1:11:06.158
Needs another hour.

1:11:06.158 --> 1:11:08.619
They have hot water!

1:11:08.619 --> 1:11:10.162
I'm takin' a shower.

1:11:10.162 --> 1:11:11.830
And then you're showering

1:11:11.830 --> 1:11:13.457
because seriously.

1:11:58.585 --> 1:11:59.712
Oh shit.

1:12:01.630 --> 1:12:03.549
Well, don't you look pretty.

1:12:04.258 --> 1:12:05.175
Shut up.

1:12:07.052 --> 1:12:07.970
Nice.

1:12:31.118 --> 1:12:33.704
- It's your first time in a car?
- It's like a spaceship.

1:12:33.704 --> 1:12:35.706
No, it's like a piece of shit Chevy S10,

1:12:35.706 --> 1:12:38.834
but it'll get us there, I think.

1:12:39.710 --> 1:12:40.711
Seatbelt.

1:12:47.342 --> 1:12:48.469
Seatbelt.

1:12:50.262 --> 1:12:51.764
So cool.

1:13:05.027 --> 1:13:06.361
Would ya leave it?

1:13:07.362 --> 1:13:08.489
Put it back.

1:13:08.489 --> 1:13:09.490
Ellie.

1:13:14.661 --> 1:13:15.537
Oh, no, wait.

1:13:15.537 --> 1:13:17.039
No, leave it. Leave it.

1:13:17.039 --> 1:13:19.208
This is good. This is Linda Ronstadt.

1:13:19.208 --> 1:13:20.751
Do you know who Linda Ronstadt is?

1:13:20.751 --> 1:13:22.753
You know I don't know
who Linda Ronstadt is.

1:13:30.677 --> 1:13:32.012
Oh, man.

1:13:34.807 --> 1:13:36.308
It's better than nothing.
