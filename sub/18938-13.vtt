00:05.963 --> 00:07.338
Kate: Previously on
"Workin' Moms"

00:07.338 --> 00:08.672
- Kate.

00:08.672 --> 00:10.588
- I could sell a scuba tank
to a sea horse.

00:10.588 --> 00:12.463
- And that's why you're here.

00:12.463 --> 00:14.797
- You sure about this?
- Yeah, I'm so sure.

00:14.797 --> 00:16.422
- Jenny, is that a nipple ring?

00:16.422 --> 00:19.505
- I'm sorry, I-I don't know
what's going on with me.

00:19.505 --> 00:21.172
- Did you sell our baby?

00:21.172 --> 00:23.005
- I sold our house.
- Excuse me?

00:23.005 --> 00:24.713
- You wanna dress me?

00:24.713 --> 00:28.672
- Would you allow me
to arrange something for you?

00:28.672 --> 00:32.005
- I'm drowning, Frankie.
I can't do this anymore.

00:35.922 --> 00:38.713
(Alarm clock blares)
(Startled waking gasp)

00:38.713 --> 00:41.755
(Glass shatters)
Oh, God dammit.

00:43.130 --> 00:46.213
(Alarm clock blares)
Ugh.

00:46.213 --> 00:47.547
Mmm.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.297
Shhh. Enough.

00:51.422 --> 00:54.255
Ugh.

00:54.255 --> 00:56.547
(Video chat messenger rings)
(Charlie cries)

00:56.547 --> 00:59.338
- It's a rash.
Charlie's got a rash.

00:59.338 --> 01:02.338
- Mm, good morning.
How did you sleep?

01:02.338 --> 01:05.005
- Sorry, not such a good
morning on this end.

01:05.005 --> 01:07.255
Sarah got some last minute gig

01:07.255 --> 01:09.380
and left me to fend
for myself today.

01:09.380 --> 01:11.755
and then this guy woke up
hysterical.

01:11.755 --> 01:13.838
- I'm sorry. Okay,
Do you wanna try my mom or...

01:13.838 --> 01:15.963
- Believe me,
I've been up for hours.

01:15.963 --> 01:17.797
I've tried everyone,
no one can swing it.

01:17.797 --> 01:19.838
- Nathan, he gets rashes
all the time.

01:19.838 --> 01:21.422
You know, give him
a lukewarm bath,

01:21.422 --> 01:23.338
followed up with a heavy
hint of rash cream.

01:23.338 --> 01:25.130
Make him pound water all day.

01:25.130 --> 01:26.922
It should be clear by tonight.
I promise.

01:26.922 --> 01:29.130
- Okay, I get it.
Let's move on.

01:29.130 --> 01:31.297
Are you nervous about today?
- Mm-mm.

01:31.297 --> 01:33.088
I'm feeling really good
about it.

01:33.088 --> 01:36.630
Finally time to flex my muscles
in front of the Stromanger.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.880
God, I hope I do her justice.
She's a tough cookie.

01:38.880 --> 01:40.255
- You're gonna kill it.

01:40.255 --> 01:42.088
And then I'm gonna be the one
breaking out in hives.

01:42.088 --> 01:45.172
Okay, I gotta get this kid
in a hot bath.

01:45.172 --> 01:47.588
- Lukewarm, Nathan.

02:41.880 --> 02:43.963
where do you get most
of your clothes?

02:43.963 --> 02:45.922

02:45.922 --> 02:47.797
I get most of my clothes
online.

02:47.797 --> 02:50.547
- Oh, so you don't make them
yourself?

02:50.547 --> 02:53.422
- No. Some kid in Bangladesh
makes my clothes.

02:53.422 --> 02:56.088
- You know, making your own
clothes isn't that crazy.

02:56.088 --> 02:58.255
I knit all my scarves.

02:58.255 --> 03:00.088
I even made my own moccasins.

03:00.088 --> 03:01.755
- Is this before or after
you foraged for berries?

03:01.755 --> 03:03.672

03:03.672 --> 03:06.338
By the way, how're you feeling?

03:06.338 --> 03:08.922
- Uh, I'm all right.

you all know that I,

03:26.755 --> 03:29.713
I filled the fridge with snacks.

03:29.713 --> 03:32.213
- What kind of snacks?

03:32.213 --> 03:33.838
- Lots of good stuff.

03:33.838 --> 03:36.880
I went to the organic market,
so it's all pretty high shelf.

03:36.880 --> 03:38.463

03:44.963 --> 03:47.422
They dump everything

04:13.713 --> 04:16.088
Being the leader in 20 consumer

04:16.088 --> 04:17.713
is quite a feat.

04:34.880 --> 04:36.838

04:36.838 --> 04:38.172
and he served you well,

04:38.172 --> 04:40.088
but you're competing
in a new market now.

04:40.088 --> 04:42.297
Where sleek images
have a greater impact.

04:42.297 --> 04:44.672
Look, your product's quality
shouldn't be touched.

04:44.672 --> 04:46.838
It is, hands down,
the finest on the market.

04:46.838 --> 04:49.963
But packaging matters.
We've tested both images

04:49.963 --> 04:52.005
and this one has gotten more
traction. Period.

04:52.005 --> 04:53.630
- But I specifically
told Victoria,

04:53.630 --> 04:55.588
I wanted to keep the pig.

04:55.588 --> 04:57.672
- But you didn't come here
to get placated.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.463
And I'm willing
to risk our business

04:59.463 --> 05:03.088
to show you that this is
what's best for Westwood Foods.

05:06.380 --> 05:08.797

05:16.713 --> 05:18.088
Piera: I am so sorry.

05:18.088 --> 05:20.255
I would never interrupt
if it wasn't urgent.

05:22.297 --> 05:24.213

for just one moment.

05:24.213 --> 05:26.130

I don't normally bother people
like that, I promise you.

05:30.797 --> 05:32.338
- What is it? Is it Charlie?

05:32.338 --> 05:34.463
- So, he's running
a pretty serious fever,

05:34.463 --> 05:35.838
so I brought him to the hospital

05:35.838 --> 05:37.380
and they gave him a blood test.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.297
Kate, what if he's got
the measles?

05:39.297 --> 05:41.755
Did you know babies can die
from the measles?

05:41.755 --> 05:44.005
- The measles? Did the doctor
actually say that?

05:44.005 --> 05:46.922
- No, they're running the test
right now.

05:46.922 --> 05:50.963
- So it can be something else,
something less measle-y?

05:50.963 --> 05:52.880
- Less measle-y? Jesus, Kate.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.838
That's a little bit too calm,
even for you.

05:54.838 --> 05:56.505

05:56.505 --> 05:58.255
you know, on the spectrum
of freaking out,

05:58.255 --> 06:00.338
there's the Measles: holy shit.

06:00.338 --> 06:02.713
And then there's: I don't know,
hand, foot and mouth disease.

06:02.713 --> 06:04.755
- Well, fingers crossed for
hand, foot and mouth disease.

06:04.755 --> 06:07.713
- No. (Exhales)

06:07.713 --> 06:09.880
- I assume you're still doing
that presentation?

06:09.880 --> 06:11.880

06:11.880 --> 06:14.088

06:50.838 --> 06:53.213
So, uh, the pig...

I'm so sorry, I just found out
my son is in the hospital

07:00.338 --> 07:04.088

not even one--

07:04.088 --> 07:07.505
- Well, let's take a 5 minute
repose, shall we?

07:07.505 --> 07:10.630

So sorry.

07:22.880 --> 07:25.213
- Are you out of your damn mind?
- What?

07:25.213 --> 07:28.755
- You never reveal negative
truths to the client.

07:28.755 --> 07:30.797
When they think Gaze,
they should think about

07:30.797 --> 07:32.172
all the money that we're gonna
make them,

07:32.172 --> 07:36.755
not about sick children.
- I'm sorry, um...

07:36.755 --> 07:39.755
how am I supposed to continue
talking about cold cuts,

07:39.755 --> 07:42.380
when I know my one year old
is in the hospital?

07:42.380 --> 07:44.838
You are a mother,
what would you do?

07:44.838 --> 07:47.047
- Think about what is
important to you

07:47.047 --> 07:50.672
because this is a slippery
slope.

07:50.672 --> 07:53.797
Was I at every school play? No.

07:53.797 --> 07:56.255
- But this...this isn't
a school play, okay--

07:56.255 --> 07:59.213
- Thank God for you, you have
a capable husband at home.

07:59.213 --> 08:01.755
Anyone can be a mother, Kate.

08:03.297 --> 08:06.380
Going to the hospital
might ease your guilt,

08:06.380 --> 08:09.130
but think about what you lose.

08:11.630 --> 08:15.422
- What... I'm sorry. What-
what exactly would I lose?

08:16.922 --> 08:20.422
- I will see you back
in that room, Kate.

08:23.213 --> 08:25.963
I am so sorry,
but everything is fine.

08:28.838 --> 08:30.713
- Thank you for moving
the inspection up.

08:30.713 --> 08:34.505
- Yeah, no problem.
So, let's start on this floor.

08:34.505 --> 08:37.005
- Yes. Let's...

08:37.005 --> 08:39.797
- Um... did we get the wrong
time?

08:39.797 --> 08:42.463
- No. You got the right time.

08:42.463 --> 08:44.005
I wanted to meet
the buyer in person

08:44.005 --> 08:47.005
before they got in deep
with this sinking ship.

08:47.005 --> 08:49.505
- Sorry, "sinking ship"?

08:49.505 --> 08:52.463
- I am here to provide
some valuable insight.

08:52.463 --> 08:54.255
Like this wall, for example:

08:54.255 --> 08:56.005
supposedly a load-bearing wall,
but it's weak.

08:58.297 --> 09:00.005
My partner and I
made love against it,

09:00.005 --> 09:01.672
the night we moved in.

09:01.672 --> 09:05.130
Listen, (knocking)
practically hollow.

09:05.130 --> 09:08.172
- Uh, seems fine to me.
- Okay, Dale is known

09:08.172 --> 09:10.255
for playing fast and loose
with homes.

09:10.255 --> 09:12.547
- He came highly recommended.

09:12.547 --> 09:14.963
- Okay, well you know what
doesn't come high recommended?

09:14.963 --> 09:17.213
Is this closet.

09:17.213 --> 09:20.380
It is ripe with mold.

09:20.380 --> 09:23.130
Listen, this dump is gonna be
a real handful

09:23.130 --> 09:25.547
for somebody who doesn't have
a personal stake in it.

09:25.547 --> 09:27.172
- Oh, well,
I'm planning to gut it,

09:27.172 --> 09:28.963
so none of this really matters.
- What?

09:28.963 --> 09:31.713
- Um, if we could just
move things right along?

09:31.713 --> 09:34.297
- Maybe we'll start upstairs.
- Right. (Polite laugh)

09:42.255 --> 09:43.922
- Shit.

09:45.297 --> 09:48.047
Alice, put your damn unicorns
away.

10:01.713 --> 10:04.797
Okay, this is happening.

Pioneer Day Woman".

10:10.797 --> 10:12.713
In pioneer times,

10:12.713 --> 10:15.338
families often make their
own clothes by shearing sheep

10:15.338 --> 10:17.672
and then making wool
on their spinning wheels.

10:17.672 --> 10:19.630
- Oh, I get it.

10:19.630 --> 10:23.297
- You don't make them yourself?
- What? No. (Laughs)

10:23.297 --> 10:25.755

makes my clothes.

10:25.755 --> 10:27.713

have sucked more.

How was yours?

10:53.630 --> 10:55.547
- Um, sorry, could you not?

10:55.547 --> 10:58.338
I'm just, I am in the middle
of this really pivotal scene.

10:58.338 --> 11:02.130
He's right about to confront
the leader of the park nannies.

11:04.797 --> 11:07.255
- I feel like you've been weird
around me.

11:07.255 --> 11:09.005
- Okay.

11:10.297 --> 11:12.380
- What? No, no, no-no-no!

11:14.130 --> 11:17.422
Fine. Okay, you wanna do this?
Let's do this.

11:17.422 --> 11:19.005
- I just wanna connect with you.

11:19.005 --> 11:21.255
- Why? Why would you ever
get a nipple ring?

11:21.255 --> 11:22.588

It's this amazing thing
that's finally happened to me

11:30.172 --> 11:32.922
and you couldn't care less.
- Of course I care--

11:32.922 --> 11:35.630
- Your hugs, straight up,
suck lately!

11:35.630 --> 11:38.047
Hugging my own wife is like
hugging an unconscious woman--

11:38.047 --> 11:39.213
- No.

11:39.213 --> 11:42.255
