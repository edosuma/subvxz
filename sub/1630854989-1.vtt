29:42.880 --> 29:44.240
...I'm sorry.

29:46.640 --> 29:48.160
Don't worry about it.

29:48.160 --> 29:51.280
You were right. We should leave.

29:51.280 --> 29:52.960
Let's head back
to Uncle Tony's club.

29:52.960 --> 29:55.000
Get some money from him
and go through the slips.

29:55.000 --> 29:56.240
Alright.

29:57.360 --> 29:58.400
Look at you.

29:59.640 --> 30:01.000
So beautiful.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.120
I love you.
I love you too.

30:13.320 --> 30:16.200
Money-lending, protection, brasses.

30:16.200 --> 30:18.640
But his greed fucked him.

30:18.640 --> 30:20.760
Now he's just another ageing mug.

Youngest and the most unlikely.

All we know about him
is he works in a print mill.

31:04.800 --> 31:08.200
But he's just boarded a flight
to Malaga with a female companion.

No, no. That's the one thing I own.
