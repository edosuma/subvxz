Tatiana,
hustle your ass down here!

02:18.712 --> 02:21.112
Tatiana, now!

02:21.114 --> 02:23.650
Hey, sexpot.

02:24.985 --> 02:27.453
I just wanted to say

02:27.455 --> 02:29.721
I had a really nice time
last night.

02:29.723 --> 02:33.525
And, um,

02:33.527 --> 02:35.727
I'm sorry about
what I said in the car.

02:35.729 --> 02:39.465
I... I know how mad
it makes you,

02:39.467 --> 02:41.900
and I promise
I won't say it again.

02:41.902 --> 02:45.670
It's just,
I couldn't help myself. I...

02:45.672 --> 02:47.939
I think I am
in love with you.

02:57.517 --> 03:00.818
I thought I threw
those boots in the trash.

03:00.820 --> 03:02.187
You did.

03:02.189 --> 03:04.021
If you keep
fishing them out,

03:04.023 --> 03:06.624
you're going to break
your neck.

03:06.626 --> 03:08.659
You know, I got
better things to do than

03:08.661 --> 03:11.131
push you around in a wheelchair
the rest of my life.

03:14.868 --> 03:16.168
Morning.

03:48.802 --> 03:50.535
You should've seen the way

03:50.537 --> 03:51.802
he was looking
at me last night.

03:51.804 --> 03:53.572
I mean, it's real.

03:53.574 --> 03:55.873
And he's so smart.

03:55.875 --> 03:58.075
I shouldn't have said it.
I shouldn't have said it.

03:58.077 --> 04:00.078
You never tell 'em
you love 'em.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.747
Everybody knows.
It's textbook.

04:01.749 --> 04:03.080
Everyone except you,
apparently.

04:03.082 --> 04:05.082
Hey, I deserve
a little respect.

04:05.084 --> 04:08.020
No, no. You're right on track,
sleeping with a married man.

04:08.022 --> 04:10.289
A soon-to-be divorced
married man.

04:10.291 --> 04:11.993
Okay, sure.

04:19.833 --> 04:21.833
Could you at least try
to fix your hair?

04:21.834 --> 04:24.903
I am fixing it.
I'm fixing it to cover my face.

04:24.905 --> 04:27.572
Not that you give a shit,
but you look pretty cute

04:27.574 --> 04:30.108
when people can actually
see your face.

04:30.110 --> 04:33.011
And ditching that thing in your
nose wouldn't hurt either.

04:33.013 --> 04:34.846
You're the one
who took me to get it.

04:34.848 --> 04:37.315
What can I say?
I'm an idiot.

04:37.317 --> 04:38.716
Nnn!

04:38.718 --> 04:40.718
No comment.

04:49.730 --> 04:51.932
Walk much?

05:23.196 --> 05:25.665
I think I might yark.

05:29.836 --> 05:32.637
1975 Mustang Stocker,

05:32.639 --> 05:34.072
blue-and-red tampo.

05:34.074 --> 05:37.242
Original package.
Never played with.

05:37.244 --> 05:39.211
Wow.

05:39.213 --> 05:41.812
That is so... neat.

05:41.814 --> 05:43.714
I always said
when I was a dentist,

05:43.716 --> 05:45.750
I was going to have
the coolest waiting room.

05:45.752 --> 05:47.386
Well, you succeeded.

05:47.388 --> 05:49.821
Hey, so, um,

05:49.823 --> 05:52.023
did you get
my message?

05:52.025 --> 05:54.925
I had a really good
time last night.

05:54.927 --> 05:56.995
Not here, Darlene.

05:56.997 --> 05:59.967
There's a cleaning in Exam 4.

06:01.335 --> 06:03.137
Hmph.

06:06.372 --> 06:08.939
Hey, Tats.

06:08.941 --> 06:10.675
- What's up?
- Hey.

06:10.677 --> 06:12.778
So, did you read it?

06:12.780 --> 06:14.211
Yeah.
I have to be honest.

06:14.213 --> 06:16.081
I'm not sure
those books are religious.

06:16.083 --> 06:17.783
I get them
from my church.

06:17.785 --> 06:19.785
It's basically
torture porn.

06:19.787 --> 06:21.086
That chapter on
the left leg of hell,

06:21.088 --> 06:23.689
with the demon making that
other guy drink molten lead?

06:23.691 --> 06:24.990
- Mm-hmm.
- That was disgusting.

06:24.992 --> 06:26.992
Right?
I mean, who knew

06:26.994 --> 06:28.526
that hell was divided
into parts of the body?

06:28.528 --> 06:32.030
You haven't even gotten to the
best chapter yet: the bowels.

06:32.032 --> 06:33.898
- Mm.
- When people are in there,

06:33.900 --> 06:35.367
it's like they're
swimming in acid.

06:35.369 --> 06:36.701
Their skin burns off.

06:36.703 --> 06:38.069
It's awesome.

06:38.071 --> 06:39.437
Yeah, I'll take
your word for it.

06:39.439 --> 06:41.839
I don't know. It's just
not that fun to read about

06:41.841 --> 06:44.108
the place where my skanky mom's
probably going to end up.

06:44.110 --> 06:46.244
Happens to everyone who
commits sins of the flesh.

06:46.246 --> 06:49.447
That's her.
Biggest slut in the game.

06:49.449 --> 06:51.949
Here. This one's
even sicker.

06:51.951 --> 06:53.884
It's the next one
in the series.

06:53.886 --> 06:55.052
The devil's
actually a parasite

06:55.054 --> 06:56.286
that eats a person
from the inside out.

06:56.288 --> 06:58.824
I put Post-It notes
on all the good parts.

06:58.826 --> 07:01.595
- Catch you later.
- Thank you.

07:03.196 --> 07:04.999
Mm-hmm.

07:07.100 --> 07:11.168
Sophomores, you have proven
that teenagers can in fact

07:11.170 --> 07:14.338
survive the ancient art
of letter writing.

07:14.340 --> 07:16.942
You have personally corresponded
with luminaries

07:16.944 --> 07:19.177
who have inspired you.

07:19.179 --> 07:21.879
Does anyone care
to share whom...

07:21.881 --> 07:24.249
not who, whom...

07:24.251 --> 07:27.185
you selected?

07:27.187 --> 07:29.954
I wrote to Mark Zuckerberg,
'cause he's so rich.

07:29.956 --> 07:33.290
Inspiring choice.
Anyone else?

07:33.292 --> 07:35.761
Miss Miles,

07:35.763 --> 07:37.963
care to tell us
who you wrote to?

07:37.965 --> 07:39.463
Anton Vincent.

07:39.465 --> 07:41.836
The dictator?

07:43.035 --> 07:46.004
Miss Miles,
the assignment was

07:46.006 --> 07:48.773
to write to a role model,
someone you admire.

07:48.775 --> 07:50.475
I admire his style.

07:50.477 --> 07:52.310
You shouldn't admire
anything about him.

07:52.312 --> 07:54.346
- He's evil.
- Okay, well,

07:54.348 --> 07:56.480
so were the Khmer Rouge,
and they had good style.

07:56.482 --> 08:00.886
Well,

08:00.888 --> 08:03.788
I certainly appreciate
the shock-and-awe,

08:03.790 --> 08:05.923
Tatiana,

08:05.925 --> 08:08.894
but honestly,
you're smarter than that.

08:08.896 --> 08:11.862
There is a reason
27 countries

08:11.864 --> 08:16.000
have united to overthrow
Anton Vincent.

08:16.002 --> 08:19.339
- He's a horrible person.
- Who looks cool.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.915
You found the evidence
on their computers, yes?

08:29.917 --> 08:31.882
They did not
have computers.

08:31.884 --> 08:34.485
Then-Then how did you know
they were traitors?

08:34.486 --> 08:36.254
You said
they were, sir.

08:36.256 --> 08:38.423
You ordered
their executions.

08:38.424 --> 08:41.993
If they had evidence
on their computers!

08:41.995 --> 08:43.894
But they didn't
have computers.

08:43.895 --> 08:45.230
Fire!

08:45.232 --> 08:47.365
Sir, I'm sorry.

08:47.367 --> 08:49.234
I thought you said that
you had the evidence.

08:49.236 --> 08:52.370
I am so sorry, sir.
I misunderstood.

08:52.372 --> 08:54.004
Sir, I'm sorry!

08:54.006 --> 08:56.240
Sir, I misunderstood
what you said!

08:56.242 --> 08:59.446
Sir! Please!
Please forgive me, sir. Please!

09:00.580 --> 09:02.415
Sir! Sir!

09:57.304 --> 09:59.037
Oh.

09:59.039 --> 10:00.471
Oh!

10:00.473 --> 10:03.107
Oh!

10:03.109 --> 10:05.277
Charles, stop it.
You're...

10:09.549 --> 10:12.984
Ooh! Oh!
That feels so good.

10:12.986 --> 10:14.919
Ah!

10:14.921 --> 10:16.654
You are so sexy.

10:16.656 --> 10:20.124
Oh, my God.
Dr. Charles.

10:20.126 --> 10:23.628
Patty won't let me
do this to her.

10:23.630 --> 10:25.697
She thinks it's strange.

10:25.699 --> 10:29.567
Oh, my God.
<i>She's</i> strange.

10:29.569 --> 10:32.037
It's liberating, right?

10:32.039 --> 10:33.574
Here.

10:36.075 --> 10:37.408
- Ah!
- Keep recording.

10:37.410 --> 10:39.345
I'll watch it again
later at home.

10:41.247 --> 10:44.081
Oh, my God.
You're amazing.

10:44.083 --> 10:46.083
Chrissake.

10:46.085 --> 10:49.155
Hold that thought.
Darlene Miles.

10:51.558 --> 10:53.091
What?

10:53.093 --> 10:55.393
So what are
you gonna do?

10:55.395 --> 10:57.028
Who knows?

10:57.030 --> 10:58.562
Maybe we'll be
pen pals.

10:58.564 --> 11:01.231
Right. You can ask him
his favorite color,

11:01.233 --> 11:02.701
his favorite movie,

11:02.703 --> 11:06.037
and how many people
he's tortured this week.

11:06.039 --> 11:08.539
Dictators get
such a bad rap.

11:08.541 --> 11:11.009
I wonder why.

11:11.011 --> 11:13.244
Look, he mailed me
his armband, okay?

11:13.246 --> 11:15.316
He can't be
that horrible.

11:18.517 --> 11:20.384
When we freed our country

11:20.386 --> 11:23.388
from the dirty
capitalist swine,

11:23.390 --> 11:26.591
we expected
a better life.

11:26.593 --> 11:28.293
Yet I regret to say

11:28.295 --> 11:30.461
there are still challenges.

11:30.463 --> 11:33.697
The surpluses we expected
in milk production

11:33.699 --> 11:36.100
were ill-considered.

11:36.102 --> 11:39.169
There are critical shortages
of gas,

11:39.171 --> 11:43.041
bread, and soap.

11:43.043 --> 11:45.409
I ask that you please
try harder.

11:45.411 --> 11:47.077
We are trying harder!

11:47.079 --> 11:50.248
I too must sacrifice.

11:50.250 --> 11:52.517
This morning I learned
that my brother-in-arms

11:52.519 --> 11:56.687
sold military secrets
to the United States.

11:58.692 --> 12:01.292
Oh, my God!

12:01.294 --> 12:05.230
For this,
I blame the enemy.

12:05.232 --> 12:07.164
They can take away
our friends,

12:07.166 --> 12:09.667
but they cannot take away
our spirit.

12:09.669 --> 12:12.336
Homeland... or death!

12:12.338 --> 12:15.440
Homeland or death!

12:15.442 --> 12:16.774
You don't belong here!

12:16.776 --> 12:18.610
Put your sunblock on
and go home!

12:18.612 --> 12:20.314
Shoot this guy.

12:21.548 --> 12:23.514
Did I tell you
I can't practice next week?

12:23.516 --> 12:26.317
- Oh, yeah. The Bible retreat.
- Mm-hmm.

12:26.319 --> 12:29.053
What exactly do you do
on those things?

12:29.055 --> 12:31.557
We worship. It's rad.

12:35.594 --> 12:38.363
I... I'm sorry.
I don't know why I did that.

12:38.365 --> 12:40.465
It's okay. It's okay.

12:40.467 --> 12:43.168
Um, it's just temptation.

12:43.170 --> 12:44.769
You can shun it.

12:44.771 --> 12:47.072
You're right.

12:47.074 --> 12:49.374
I feel like
such a reject.

12:49.376 --> 12:51.477
The Lord will
show you the way.

13:16.203 --> 13:17.802
Tatiana,

13:17.804 --> 13:19.770
what the hell
is wrong with you?

13:19.772 --> 13:22.639
Your forehead vein
looks like it's gonna pop.

13:22.641 --> 13:23.941
You should chill.

13:23.943 --> 13:26.244
I'm sorry. How am I supposed
to chill when I get a call

13:26.246 --> 13:27.778
from the high-school
principal saying

13:27.780 --> 13:29.514
my kid's a total fuck-up?

13:29.516 --> 13:31.216
I'm sure she used
those exact words.

13:31.218 --> 13:32.783
She did,
and then she says that

13:32.785 --> 13:36.287
you need more guidance...
like it's my fault.

13:36.289 --> 13:38.755
You know, you try having a kid
when you're in high school,

13:38.757 --> 13:41.525
- and you see how well you do.
- No, thank you.

13:41.527 --> 13:43.760
You don't think I want
to be some smart-ass

13:43.762 --> 13:48.133
writing letters to a dictator
for a school project?

13:48.135 --> 13:51.536
I don't even know
what that means!

13:51.538 --> 13:53.671
- I used to be a rebel once.
- No.

13:53.673 --> 13:56.673
That's fine. That's fine.
Put it away. Okay, I get it.

13:56.675 --> 13:59.476
No, you can stop now.
You're not funny.

13:59.478 --> 14:02.880
You're disgusting.
Get away from me. Stop!

14:02.882 --> 14:05.817
I'm just saying,
look where it got me.

14:05.819 --> 14:09.455
I got you extra Sriracha.
You're welcome very much.

14:27.373 --> 14:29.706
- I need you to come with me.
- I'm busy.

14:29.708 --> 14:31.308
You don't even know
where I want you to go.

14:31.310 --> 14:32.610
Yeah, to your
geezer boyfriend's,

14:32.612 --> 14:35.179
so you can sit outside
and see if he's cheating on you.

14:35.181 --> 14:37.182
I'm sure he's with
someone else.

14:37.184 --> 14:38.883
Like his wife?

14:47.861 --> 14:49.860
Okay, go up.
Look in the windows.

14:49.862 --> 14:52.496
He said he was going
to be home, but...

14:52.498 --> 14:54.966
he hasn't returned
any of my texts.

14:54.968 --> 14:57.235
The lights are on.

14:57.237 --> 14:58.639
Go.

15:02.442 --> 15:05.610
March up there and scout out
the target, soldier.

15:05.612 --> 15:07.247
Go!

15:13.987 --> 15:16.490
Oop!

15:43.415 --> 15:45.718
Come on, come on!

15:49.955 --> 15:52.291
Let's go!

15:58.931 --> 16:01.365
Was he there?

16:01.367 --> 16:03.033
What do you think?
He lives there,

16:03.035 --> 16:04.668
With his lovely wife
and his two kids.

16:04.670 --> 16:05.870
Those kids aren't even
his kids.

16:05.872 --> 16:07.639
They're her kids,
from another marriage.

16:07.641 --> 16:09.606
And that Patty bitch
isn't so lovely.

16:09.608 --> 16:11.542
She is a psycho bitch

16:11.544 --> 16:13.378
who spends all his money
and acts like...

16:13.380 --> 16:16.980
Like what?
Like she's married to him?

16:16.982 --> 16:19.283
Shit! My armband!

16:19.285 --> 16:21.588
Mom, we got to go back.

16:32.866 --> 16:34.666
<i>Dear Anton,
thanks for the armband.</i>

16:34.668 --> 16:37.567
<i>I'm wearing it right now
even though my mom hates it,</i>

16:37.569 --> 16:41.004
<i>but I hate my mom,
so that makes us even.</i>

16:41.006 --> 16:44.442
<i>Okay, to be honest,
I'm not wearing it right now,</i>

16:44.444 --> 16:46.711
<i>because it fell off when I was
running away from someone.</i>

16:46.713 --> 16:48.178
<i>Long story.
I hope everything</i>

16:48.180 --> 16:50.447
<i>is going good
with your country.</i>

16:50.449 --> 16:52.185
<i>From, Tatiana.</i>

16:53.852 --> 16:56.553
<i>Dear Tatiana, I'm sorry</i>

16:56.555 --> 16:58.755
<i>you and your mother
are feuding.</i>

16:58.757 --> 17:00.892
<i>I have a daughter who is
a little older than you,</i>

17:00.894 --> 17:04.560
<i>and at times
she does not like me either.</i>

17:04.563 --> 17:07.632
<i>Things in my country
are difficult right now.</i>

17:07.634 --> 17:09.467
<i>There is a rebel faction</i>

17:09.469 --> 17:11.469
<i>that wants to overthrow
the government</i>

17:11.471 --> 17:13.904
<i>and behead me
and my family.</i>

17:13.906 --> 17:15.405
<i>It is stressful.</i>

17:15.406 --> 17:18.076
<i>It feels like there is
no one I can trust.</i>

17:18.078 --> 17:20.010
<i>Oh, I can totally relate</i>

17:20.012 --> 17:21.377
<i>about the trust thing.</i>

17:21.380 --> 17:23.047
<i>I just got dicked over
by a teacher</i>

17:23.049 --> 17:25.883
<i>who's got a stick up his butt
'cause I wrote to you.</i>

17:25.885 --> 17:28.519
<i>To give you an idea
of the loser-dom at my school,</i>

17:28.521 --> 17:31.455
<i>there's a group of girls who
call themselves "slushies."</i>

17:31.457 --> 17:33.590
<i>It stands for
"sluts and lushes."</i>

17:33.592 --> 17:35.759
<i>Sarvia is the one
they all worship,</i>

17:35.761 --> 17:37.095
<i>which is a joke,
if you ever saw her.</i>

17:37.097 --> 17:39.630
<i>She thinks
whale tails look good.</i>

17:39.632 --> 17:41.798
<i>And somehow,
everyone agrees with her.</i>

17:41.800 --> 17:44.501
<i>Borderline retarded, right?</i>

17:44.503 --> 17:45.970
<i>Anyway, I'm sorry that</i>

17:45.972 --> 17:47.771
<i>people want to kill you
and your family.</i>

17:47.773 --> 17:49.374
<i>That's messed up.</i>

17:49.376 --> 17:52.009
<i>By the way,
what's your favorite color?</i>

17:52.011 --> 17:53.544
<i>Your letters have been</i>

17:53.546 --> 17:55.179
<i>a welcome respite
from my struggles.</i>

17:55.181 --> 17:58.548
<i>In addition to making threats
of invasion,</i>

17:58.550 --> 18:01.652
<i>the United States supports
the rebel army</i>

18:01.654 --> 18:04.721
<i>and has placed an embargo
around our borders.</i>

18:04.723 --> 18:07.892
<i>It is impossible for goods
to come in or out.</i>

18:07.894 --> 18:11.496
<i>My people cannot get
medical supplies,</i>

18:11.498 --> 18:14.664
<i>and many people are dying.</i>

18:14.666 --> 18:16.800
<i>My favorite color is purple.</i>

18:16.802 --> 18:18.536
<i>I like purple too.</i>

18:18.538 --> 18:21.939
<i>Does the embargo mean that
you can't download cool music?</i>

18:21.941 --> 18:23.507
<i>That blows.</i>

18:23.509 --> 18:26.109
<i>Maybe I can rip a CD
for your daughter.</i>

18:26.111 --> 18:29.079
<i>Does she like
classic '80s hardcore?</i>

18:29.081 --> 18:32.016
<i>Bands like the Meatmen,
the Dead Kennedys,</i>

18:32.018 --> 18:33.550
<i>Gangrene, Dead Milkmen,</i>

18:33.552 --> 18:37.422
<i>the Butthole Surfers,
Agent Orange?</i>

18:37.424 --> 18:39.760
<i>Oh, definitely
the Circle Jerks.</i>

18:41.694 --> 18:43.693
<i>Thank you
for your lively music.</i>

18:43.695 --> 18:45.695
<i>My daughter enjoyed it.</i>

18:45.697 --> 18:48.301
<i>The rebels have surrounded
the capital.</i>

18:50.036 --> 18:51.402
<i>I know it sounds psycho</i>

18:51.404 --> 18:53.237
<i>'cause we've never even met,
but...</i>

18:53.239 --> 18:56.943
<i>sometimes I feel like you're
the only one who gets me.</i>

18:58.711 --> 19:00.444
<i>My correspondence</i>

19:00.446 --> 19:02.315
<i>will be less frequent.</i>

19:03.883 --> 19:05.281
<i>Big bummer.</i>

19:05.283 --> 19:09.619
<i>P.S.,
I drew you a picture.</i>

19:11.523 --> 19:13.827
Mom, what's going on
in there?

19:16.029 --> 19:18.865
You better not O.D.
on cough syrup again!

19:24.604 --> 19:26.540
What happened?

19:33.913 --> 19:36.750
He fired me.

19:38.585 --> 19:40.684
He said I was

19:40.686 --> 19:43.753
causing him added stress.

19:43.755 --> 19:47.059
He didn't complain about
added stress when...

19:48.761 --> 19:50.795
when I was doing that thing

19:50.797 --> 19:53.029
that his... that his wife
won't let him do.

19:53.031 --> 19:56.233
- No, ew, Mom. Too much.
- No, it's not what you think.

19:56.235 --> 19:58.635
God, I let him put my...

19:58.637 --> 20:02.205
No, no, no. I really
don't need to know.

20:02.207 --> 20:04.575
But, um,

20:04.577 --> 20:05.976
I think
it's safe to say

20:05.978 --> 20:09.513
Mr. Sexpot wasn't your ticket
to the American dream.

20:09.515 --> 20:11.083
It's okay.

20:37.076 --> 20:38.712
Hey, Den.

20:40.780 --> 20:42.012
You know this maxi pad?

20:42.014 --> 20:44.315
Yeah, we know each other.
We jam together.

20:44.317 --> 20:47.151
Tatiana, Sarvia.

20:47.153 --> 20:48.986
Sarvia, Tatiana.

20:48.988 --> 20:50.153
We're already acquainted.

20:50.155 --> 20:52.323
So when'd you get back
from Jesus camp?

20:52.325 --> 20:53.958
I tried your cell all night.

20:53.960 --> 20:55.226
That must've been
when we were...

20:55.228 --> 20:57.028
busy.

20:57.030 --> 20:58.962
Okay, well, I just
wanted to let you know

20:58.964 --> 21:00.730
that I wrote back
to the dictator.

21:00.732 --> 21:02.999
Oh, I heard about that little
genius plan of yours.

21:03.001 --> 21:05.102
I don't mean to crush
your dreams or anything,

21:05.104 --> 21:07.305
but, you know,
your pen pal's probably dead.

21:07.307 --> 21:09.973
- What do you know about it?
- It's all over Twitter.

21:09.975 --> 21:12.609
We droned the shit out of
his country this morning.

21:12.611 --> 21:15.448
Everything's
all blown up.

21:25.157 --> 21:26.656
<i>The palace
of communist dictator</i>

21:26.658 --> 21:28.960
<i>Anton Vincent
has been under siege</i>

21:28.962 --> 21:30.661
<i>for the past three days.</i>

21:30.663 --> 21:32.328
<i>U.S.-backed
island nationals</i>

21:32.330 --> 21:36.601
<i>have ousted what would be the
last of the colonial families.</i>

21:36.603 --> 21:39.336
<i>Vincent,
a third-generation strongman,</i>

21:39.338 --> 21:40.904
<i>is still unaccounted for.</i>

21:40.906 --> 21:42.740
- Why aren't you in school?
- Shh!

21:42.742 --> 21:44.808
Don't shush me.

21:44.810 --> 21:46.943
Honey, you're
already on thin ice.

21:46.945 --> 21:49.313
<i>...to the islanders,
who are now shelling his palace</i>

21:49.315 --> 21:51.182
<i>and pillaging his residence.</i>

21:51.184 --> 21:54.119
- Off.
- Leave me alone, all right?

22:07.399 --> 22:09.299
Hey, Tats.

22:09.301 --> 22:11.736
Did you miss me?

22:11.738 --> 22:14.404
What kind of name
is Sarvia anyway?

22:14.406 --> 22:16.272
Biblical.
From the Old Testament.

22:16.274 --> 22:19.410
Oh. I bet her dad
would be mighty proud

22:19.412 --> 22:21.979
to find out how skanky
his daughter really is.

22:21.981 --> 22:26.185
It's not just... her.

22:27.753 --> 22:30.223
Tats, me and Sarvia...

22:31.991 --> 22:35.028
we uh...
we had sex.

22:38.431 --> 22:40.865
Liar.

22:40.867 --> 22:42.866
She brought some Molly
on the trip,

22:42.868 --> 22:45.903
and we took it,
and it-it was crazy.

22:45.905 --> 22:47.837
I'm going to hell, Tats.

22:47.839 --> 22:50.240
I don't believe you.
You're lying.

22:50.242 --> 22:51.741
I wish I were.

22:51.743 --> 22:54.047
She made me record
the whole thing.

22:58.784 --> 23:00.451
I don't want
to see that!

23:00.453 --> 23:02.752
I'm sending it to you anyway.

23:02.754 --> 23:05.355
There. Sent.

23:05.357 --> 23:07.124
Maybe it'll purge me.

23:07.126 --> 23:09.292
Say something.

23:09.294 --> 23:11.394
Please?

23:11.396 --> 23:14.432
- Get out.
- Tats, I don't know what...

23:14.434 --> 23:16.366
Get out!

23:16.368 --> 23:19.202
Get the fuck out!
Go!

23:19.204 --> 23:21.073
Get out!

23:41.394 --> 23:43.394
It's you.

23:43.396 --> 23:46.098
Yes. It's me.

23:49.902 --> 23:52.737
Don't make a sound.

23:52.739 --> 23:55.806
I want some water,
some food,

23:55.808 --> 23:59.242
and a computer
for the World Wide Web.

23:59.244 --> 24:01.045
Okay?

24:01.047 --> 24:03.346
I'm going to remain here.

24:03.348 --> 24:05.915
And don't do
anything foolish,

24:05.917 --> 24:08.986
because if they find me here,

24:08.988 --> 24:11.521
we could both die.

24:11.523 --> 24:14.258
You understand? Okay?

24:14.260 --> 24:17.830
- Go. Go on.
- Oh, my God.

24:27.072 --> 24:29.807
Do we have any
real food in this house?

24:29.809 --> 24:31.978
What are you,
on a health kick?

24:33.378 --> 24:35.179
No, but it would be nice

24:35.181 --> 24:38.050
if we had something
other than candy.

24:45.925 --> 24:47.791
I'm here.

24:47.793 --> 24:49.028
Okay.

24:51.062 --> 24:53.963
Did you bring
the provisions?

24:53.965 --> 24:57.468
The modem's in my room.

24:57.470 --> 24:59.303
The-The World Wide Web?

24:59.305 --> 25:02.338
But you have to wait
till my mom's gone.

25:02.340 --> 25:04.374
- Oh.
- Okay?

25:04.376 --> 25:06.343
I apologize

25:06.345 --> 25:08.444
if I frightened you.

25:08.446 --> 25:10.181
It's okay.

25:10.183 --> 25:14.151
Uh, did you bring
your daughter with you?

25:14.153 --> 25:16.153
No, she's hidden
on the island.

25:16.155 --> 25:18.087
I'm waiting till
I contact

25:18.089 --> 25:21.291
my comrades tomorrow.

25:21.293 --> 25:23.493
With your help.

25:23.495 --> 25:25.962
Okay. Also, um,

25:25.964 --> 25:28.999
this is all we had...
Red Bull, Fun Dust...

25:29.001 --> 25:31.836
but it's a pretty sick
combination, I think.

25:31.838 --> 25:33.039
Give here.

25:38.176 --> 25:40.376
Yeah, it's a little strong.

25:40.378 --> 25:42.579
Here.

25:42.581 --> 25:44.983
Hold out your hand.

25:46.618 --> 25:48.253
Okay.

25:52.491 --> 25:55.124
You're smaller
than I imagined.

25:55.126 --> 25:57.896
And you're older.

26:26.325 --> 26:29.026
What the hell?
You can't be in here!

26:29.028 --> 26:31.895
I'm trying to contact
my comrades.

26:31.897 --> 26:33.329
How do you use
this device?

26:33.331 --> 26:35.332
Okay, you're not even
in my mail program.

26:35.334 --> 26:37.166
Listen, if my mom sees you,
she'll wig out.

26:37.168 --> 26:38.368
I'm not even half-joking.

26:38.370 --> 26:40.371
This is no time
for petty matters.

26:40.373 --> 26:43.339
Tatiana,
two minutes, and I'm dust!

26:43.341 --> 26:46.076
I have to go to school!
What am I supposed to tell her?

26:46.078 --> 26:48.077
Uh, tell her you're sick.

26:48.079 --> 26:50.079
You'll learn far more
with me than you will

26:50.081 --> 26:52.449
from the U.S.
education system.

26:52.451 --> 26:54.386
Tatiana!

27:04.664 --> 27:06.931
Are you on meth?

27:06.933 --> 27:08.699
Why aren't you dressed?

27:08.701 --> 27:11.335
I... I think I'm sick.

27:11.337 --> 27:13.202
Oh. Great.

27:13.204 --> 27:15.239
Dragged my ass
out of bed for nothing.

27:15.241 --> 27:18.177
Well, you need to find
a job, don't you?

27:19.412 --> 27:22.246
Look who's telling who
what's what.

27:22.248 --> 27:24.949
Worry about yourself, missy.

27:24.951 --> 27:28.419
I am. You don't work,
I don't eat.

27:35.094 --> 27:37.493
- Has she gone?
- She will be.

27:37.495 --> 27:39.496
Good.

27:39.498 --> 27:42.132
My comrades are waiting
for me for instructions.

27:42.134 --> 27:44.969
I'm organizing
a revolutionary force,

27:44.971 --> 27:48.038
and I will re-take
the capital.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.074
For this,
I need your help.

27:50.076 --> 27:53.042
- You mean, my help?
- Your...

27:53.044 --> 27:55.179
I'm not exactly
a revolutionary.

27:55.181 --> 27:58.182
No, you are infinitely

27:58.184 --> 28:01.053
more capable
than you think you are.

28:02.253 --> 28:03.519
The only people
who agree with you

28:03.521 --> 28:05.489
are right here
in this room,

28:05.491 --> 28:07.758
and I'm not
one of them.

28:07.760 --> 28:09.425
I'm going!

28:09.427 --> 28:11.260
If you so much as
step out of this house,

28:11.262 --> 28:13.297
I'm gonna kick you
in the ass when I'm back!

28:13.299 --> 28:15.399
Love you too, Mom.

28:15.401 --> 28:18.301
I assume you have
a video camera.

28:18.303 --> 28:20.671
Why would you
assume that?

28:20.673 --> 28:24.008
You Americans fill your homes
with things you don't need.

28:24.010 --> 28:26.376
Okay, but apparently
you need it.

28:26.378 --> 28:28.211
We don't have
video cameras,

28:28.213 --> 28:30.713
We have cell phones
with cameras on them.

28:30.715 --> 28:32.281
Oh, well,

28:32.283 --> 28:33.682
we'll use that then, eh?

28:33.684 --> 28:37.121
Um, you're not taking hostages
or anything, are you?

28:37.123 --> 28:40.723
'Cause just so you know,
I am un-cool with that.

28:40.725 --> 28:42.526
No, no, no.

28:42.528 --> 28:44.127
Okay.

28:44.129 --> 28:47.663
Oh, and I need
a, uh, clean shirt.

28:47.665 --> 28:51.300
My mom got that
at a hygienist convention.

28:51.302 --> 28:53.202
It's nice, yeah?

28:53.204 --> 28:55.071
Okay, action.

28:58.174 --> 29:01.045
Comrades, countrymen,
brothers-in-arms,

29:01.047 --> 29:04.181
Anton Vincent is alive

29:04.183 --> 29:07.183
and building an army
of thousands.

29:07.185 --> 29:09.819
I will return,
and together,

29:09.821 --> 29:13.589
we will repel
the invaders.

29:13.591 --> 29:16.192
Never give up.
Never falter.

29:16.194 --> 29:19.730
Homeland or death.

29:19.732 --> 29:22.167
How was that?

29:24.470 --> 29:26.737

29:34.480 --> 29:38.214
Okay. A classic song of revolt,
but it's your call.

29:38.216 --> 29:40.249
We must hand-deliver
a copy of the video

29:40.251 --> 29:42.719
to the offices of CNN.

29:42.721 --> 29:45.355
Dude, you
really are in the Dark Ages.

29:45.357 --> 29:47.223
We can just post it.

29:47.225 --> 29:49.292
No posts!
A hard copy.

29:49.294 --> 29:51.295
Fine. I'll burn a DVD.

29:51.297 --> 29:53.763
There's a local
news studio...

29:53.765 --> 29:55.833
Then we bring it there.

29:55.835 --> 29:58.868
Okay, sorry to be a buzz-kill,
but we're lacking wheels.

29:58.870 --> 30:00.604
In my country,

30:00.606 --> 30:03.707
we ride on legs,
not foreign oil.

30:03.709 --> 30:06.609
We can't ride our bikes there.
It's like two miles.

30:06.611 --> 30:08.479
We ride.

30:08.481 --> 30:10.717
Fine. But you need
a disguise.

30:15.154 --> 30:18.424
Well, you're a better
well-dressed man than I was.

30:21.359 --> 30:24.795
The well-dressed man?
<i>Blue Velvet?</i>

30:24.797 --> 30:28.132
That was my Halloween
costume last year.

30:28.134 --> 30:29.732
What's that?

30:29.734 --> 30:31.201
It's a bicycle.

30:31.203 --> 30:34.137
No, it's not.
That's a tricycle.

30:34.139 --> 30:36.539
Okay, well, you said
you wanted to ride with legs.

30:36.541 --> 30:39.143
Yeah,
but not on a tricycle.

30:39.145 --> 30:42.248
It was my grandma's. She didn't
know how to ride a bike.

- Good work, comrade.
- Thank you.

31:46.912 --> 31:49.415
I need A-C.

31:51.383 --> 31:53.383
Dude, you need
a new outfit.

31:53.385 --> 31:55.384

32:44.869 --> 32:46.671
Oh, no. No, no.

33:02.421 --> 33:03.953
What size are you?

33:03.955 --> 33:05.857
I have no idea.

33:07.292 --> 33:08.592
How's that possible?

33:08.594 --> 33:10.760
Don't be embarrassed.
You're not a heifer or anything.

33:10.762 --> 33:12.863
Only my tailor
knows my size.

33:12.865 --> 33:16.700
He's been making my uniforms
for 26 years.

33:16.702 --> 33:19.303
Does everyone in your country
have a personal tailor?

33:19.305 --> 33:21.038
Go and get the clothes.

33:21.040 --> 33:22.875
I found just
the thing for you.

33:52.771 --> 33:54.438
This...

33:54.440 --> 33:56.709
is me.

34:01.780 --> 34:04.013
Hey, I think he's looking
at me. Look.

34:04.015 --> 34:06.016
Look down.
Don't look at him.

34:06.018 --> 34:07.750
Don't make eye contact.

34:07.752 --> 34:09.719
- Excuse me. Sir.
- Don't look up.

34:09.722 --> 34:11.455
Don't look up.
Don't look up.

34:11.456 --> 34:13.389
Oh, shoot!

34:13.391 --> 34:15.391
Sir, you've got to wait.

34:15.393 --> 34:18.397
Hey! Stop!

34:30.943 --> 34:32.641
What the hell, buddy?

34:32.643 --> 34:34.777
Okay, listen,

34:34.780 --> 34:37.112
he is not who
you think he is.

34:37.114 --> 34:39.581
I don't care who he is.

34:39.583 --> 34:42.886
When somebody with a badge
tells you to stop, you stop!

34:42.888 --> 34:46.455
I'm so sorry. My uncle's
not from around here.

34:46.456 --> 34:48.591
Now, can you produce
a receipt for those items?

34:48.592 --> 34:49.792
- Receipt?
- Uh-huh.

34:49.793 --> 34:52.027
- Yeah, yeah. Of course.
- Let me see it.

34:52.030 --> 34:53.431
Of course.

35:05.644 --> 35:08.944
Nobody leaves the store
without a hole punch.

35:08.946 --> 35:11.617
- Got it?
- Yep.

35:13.618 --> 35:15.852
Darlene. What...
What are you doing here?

35:15.854 --> 35:17.988
You don't own
the parking lot, Charles.

35:17.990 --> 35:19.288
Actually, I do.

35:19.290 --> 35:21.957
But that's beside the point.
Why are you here?

35:21.959 --> 35:25.529
I want things to go back
to the way they were,

35:25.531 --> 35:28.564
or I'm going to sue
for sexual harassment.

35:28.566 --> 35:30.600
And I'm going to
tell Patty.

35:30.602 --> 35:33.437
We both know I have video
to prove it.

35:33.439 --> 35:34.740
You're insane.

35:36.107 --> 35:38.977
I thought that's what
you liked about me.

35:42.113 --> 35:43.913
Work it out.

35:43.915 --> 35:46.017
And this is
my daughter's.

35:50.789 --> 35:52.992
- Tatiana!
- Oh, shit! Denny!

35:56.160 --> 35:57.963
Tatiana, open the door.

35:59.031 --> 36:00.866
Hey.

36:05.838 --> 36:07.703
Is he looking for me?

36:07.705 --> 36:09.673
Worse.
He's looking for me.

36:09.675 --> 36:12.676
You deserve better, Tatiana.

36:12.678 --> 36:14.778
You don't even know him.

36:14.780 --> 36:18.013
I heard what he said about
the other woman in the garage.

36:18.015 --> 36:21.720
If he doesn't see your worth,
he's not worth seeing.

36:24.522 --> 36:25.758
Come on.

36:27.024 --> 36:30.627
I feel like one of your
soldiers, wounded in battle.

36:30.629 --> 36:32.696
You're not
a foot soldier.

36:32.698 --> 36:34.698
You're a commander.

36:34.700 --> 36:36.500
Commander of what?
Loser-ville?

36:36.502 --> 36:38.602
Over your world,

36:38.604 --> 36:40.569
you have power.

36:40.571 --> 36:43.707
But you don't know
how to wield it.

36:43.709 --> 36:46.609
Your classmates
are bourgeoisie.

36:46.611 --> 36:48.678
You're proletariat.

36:48.680 --> 36:50.779
You must rise up
and conquer.

36:50.781 --> 36:52.147
It's easy
for you to say.

36:52.149 --> 36:54.049
You don't go to Seely.
They're like royalty.

36:54.051 --> 36:56.953
Well, be easy
to topple 'em.

36:56.955 --> 37:00.290
The masses
despise royalty.

37:00.292 --> 37:01.924
Oh.

37:01.926 --> 37:04.162
I want to use
your World Wide Web.

37:05.631 --> 37:07.930
You can just say "Internet."

37:07.932 --> 37:09.933
No, no, no.
The address has to go

37:09.935 --> 37:12.035
in the address field,
not in the subject.

37:12.037 --> 37:14.970
Then down here, this is
where you write your letter.

37:14.972 --> 37:17.874
And when you're done,
you hit "send."

37:17.876 --> 37:20.209
How long till
they receive it?

37:20.211 --> 37:22.546
Point-5 seconds.

37:22.548 --> 37:24.548
Point-5 seconds?

37:24.550 --> 37:26.950
Ah.

37:26.952 --> 37:29.553
Are you sure you want
to go back there?

37:29.555 --> 37:31.854
My people need me.

37:31.856 --> 37:34.624
The people who drove
a tank through your house?

37:34.626 --> 37:37.160
They will realize
their error,

37:37.162 --> 37:40.062
and I will lead
the revolution.

37:40.064 --> 37:43.299
Mm-hmm. I'm not trying
to be negative here,

37:43.301 --> 37:47.102
but didn't they just have
a revolution to get rid of you?

37:47.104 --> 37:49.305
Uh-oh.

37:49.307 --> 37:50.973
Crap, my mom's here.
Okay.

37:50.975 --> 37:54.611
Uh, hide in the closet.
Go.

37:54.613 --> 37:57.616
Go, go!
Don't make a sound!

37:59.685 --> 38:02.051
- Tatiana?
- Hmm?

38:02.053 --> 38:03.722
Hey.

38:06.091 --> 38:08.158
What's going on
in there?

38:08.160 --> 38:09.859
Nothing.

38:09.861 --> 38:11.962
I thought
you were sick.

38:11.964 --> 38:13.029
I was.

38:13.031 --> 38:14.997
I mean, I am.

38:14.999 --> 38:16.600
Even barfed.

38:16.602 --> 38:19.602
- Is your friend Denny in there?
- No.

38:19.604 --> 38:20.870
Look, I've got
my bullshit detector on,

38:20.872 --> 38:22.605
so don't even try
lying to me.

38:22.607 --> 38:24.240
- No. No. No.
- Is Denny in there?

38:24.242 --> 38:27.743
No. He is not in there.

38:27.745 --> 38:30.613
You should...
No, no, no, no,

38:30.615 --> 38:32.982
no, no, no!

38:32.984 --> 38:35.820
No!

38:42.928 --> 38:44.961
Ah.

38:44.963 --> 38:48.163
You know, it does
really burn me up

38:48.165 --> 38:50.933
- when you hide things from me.
- I'm not.

38:50.935 --> 38:53.269
- So you shouldn't feel that way.
- Really?

38:53.271 --> 38:55.037
Because when it comes to
the opposite sex,

38:55.039 --> 38:57.073
I could really
lend you some pointers.

38:57.075 --> 38:58.207
Thank you.

38:58.209 --> 38:59.975
Like number one,

38:59.977 --> 39:01.211
when you're hiding
a guy in your room,

39:01.213 --> 39:04.180
the worst place you can hide him
is in that closet.

39:04.182 --> 39:06.383
- First place everybody looks.
- Really?

39:06.385 --> 39:09.919
And the second-worst place is

39:09.921 --> 39:12.689
under the bed.

39:12.691 --> 39:15.325
Hello?

39:15.327 --> 39:18.928
Now, behind the door
is the best place,

39:18.930 --> 39:20.897
because as soon as the parental
goes for the closet,

39:20.899 --> 39:22.966
the guy slips out,
and he's home free.

39:22.968 --> 39:26.770
You know so much. Mom, I'm
actually feeling really sick.

39:26.772 --> 39:29.238
Can you go and make me
some tea or some soup?

39:29.240 --> 39:31.241
- Of course.
- Okay. Thank you.

39:31.243 --> 39:33.877
I'm just gonna...
check the closet!

39:33.879 --> 39:36.345
No, no, Mom. Don't...
No. Mom! Mom, don't!

39:41.086 --> 39:42.951
- Stop screaming.
- Mom, please, don't be mad.

39:42.953 --> 39:45.020
I was gonna tell you
about him, I swear.

39:45.022 --> 39:46.890
I'm not going
to hurt you.

39:46.892 --> 39:49.225
I'm a friend
of your daughter's.

39:49.227 --> 39:51.694
- My name is Anton Vincent.
- It's okay, Mom.

39:51.696 --> 39:54.129
He's not a creepy child
molester. He's a dictator.

39:54.131 --> 39:56.866
No, I'm here to
contact my comrades.

39:56.868 --> 39:58.368
It's true.
He's totally M.I.A.

39:58.370 --> 40:01.738
I'm waiting for instructions
from the resistance,

40:01.740 --> 40:03.238
and I'll be
on my way tomorrow.

40:03.240 --> 40:05.140
Don't be scared.
He's the good kind of dictator,

40:05.142 --> 40:06.810
not the kind
that tortures people.

40:06.812 --> 40:08.712
Right, Anton?

40:08.714 --> 40:11.781
Well, in-in the name
of-of the revolution,

40:11.783 --> 40:15.118
I've done things that
I'm-I'm not proud of.

40:15.120 --> 40:18.020
Whatever, but he didn't
torture anyone, so it's fine.

40:18.022 --> 40:21.390
Sometimes, to protect
the right of the majority,

40:21.392 --> 40:24.259
you have to infringe
the rights of the minority.

40:24.261 --> 40:27.830
Okay, but you didn't
torture people. Tell her.

40:27.832 --> 40:30.332
I chose the lesser
of two evils.

40:30.334 --> 40:32.000
You tortured people?!

40:32.002 --> 40:33.870
They were traitors,
jeopardizing

40:33.872 --> 40:36.973
the security of
thousands of citizens!

40:36.975 --> 40:40.343
You think there's no blood
on your hands? Eh?

40:40.345 --> 40:43.747
Have you seen what your country
has done round the world

40:43.749 --> 40:45.848
so that you can all have
a big TV screen?

40:45.850 --> 40:48.517
- We don't have a big TV screen.
- But you could have.

40:48.519 --> 40:51.053
You could have anything.

40:51.055 --> 40:53.256
That's what drives you...

40:53.258 --> 40:56.024
what you could have,
not what you have.

40:56.026 --> 40:58.026
You're a country
of greedy swine.

40:58.028 --> 41:00.796
You just keep eating,
eating, eating,

41:00.798 --> 41:03.299
until you can't speak!

41:03.301 --> 41:05.167
All right.

41:05.169 --> 41:08.104
If you want me to go,
I will.

41:08.106 --> 41:11.274
But please let me leave
the way I came:

41:11.276 --> 41:13.176
quietly.

41:13.178 --> 41:15.111
Will you excuse us
for a second?

41:15.113 --> 41:18.180
Oh, oh, yes, I'm sorry.

41:18.182 --> 41:19.417
Please.

41:24.388 --> 41:26.191
Bloody hell.

41:32.263 --> 41:33.897
I just want to
let you know

41:33.899 --> 41:35.098
that I had nothing
to do with this, okay?

41:35.100 --> 41:36.399
I never invited him here.

41:36.401 --> 41:38.868
He just showed up, and then
when the principal called

41:38.870 --> 41:39.935
and you got really
mad at that,

41:39.937 --> 41:41.236
I didn't want to
freak you out even more.

41:41.238 --> 41:43.439
- Tatiana. Tatiana.
- He is a political refugee.

41:43.441 --> 41:45.475
And by law, we're supposed
to give him asylum.

41:45.477 --> 41:47.877
Tatiana, for Chrissake!

41:47.879 --> 41:50.046
Why didn't you tell me?

41:50.048 --> 41:53.116
Okay, I swear I will
never not tell you

41:53.118 --> 41:55.888
I'm hiding a dictator
ever again.

41:59.957 --> 42:02.360
Uh, so can he stay?

42:08.867 --> 42:11.937
Do you think he could fix
the garage door?

42:13.104 --> 42:14.970
Hey, my mom got us Subway.

42:14.972 --> 42:17.540
- Thank you.
- And, uh, here's a list

42:17.542 --> 42:20.843
of all the junk she wants you
to do around the house.

42:20.845 --> 42:22.412
Okay.

42:22.414 --> 42:24.116
Just put that there.

42:25.350 --> 42:28.317
Have you got any more
of that colored powder?

42:28.319 --> 42:30.053
- Fun Dust?
- Yeah.

42:30.055 --> 42:32.257
Huh. You're hooked.

42:34.359 --> 42:36.158
Remember when you said
I had the power

42:36.160 --> 42:39.162
to change stuff
at my school?

42:39.164 --> 42:42.298
Do you really
think that's true?

42:42.300 --> 42:44.169
Oh, yes.

42:46.403 --> 42:47.905
Okay.

42:50.575 --> 42:53.575
Do you have factions
at your high school?

42:53.577 --> 42:55.410
You mean like cliques?

42:55.412 --> 42:58.180
Mm, those only exist
in movies about high school.

42:58.182 --> 43:00.883
Yeah, well, I don't watch
high-school movies.

43:00.885 --> 43:03.019
Well, what movies
do you watch?

43:03.021 --> 43:05.154
I don't watch movies.

43:05.156 --> 43:06.354
- Seriously?
- Mm.

43:06.356 --> 43:08.625
You're missing out.
There are some great movies.

43:08.627 --> 43:11.627
Okay, my favorite,
it's called <i>Maniac Cop 2.</i>

43:11.629 --> 43:14.897
It's about this cop...
actually, he's a dead cop.

43:14.899 --> 43:17.165
So then he dies,
he comes back to life,

43:17.167 --> 43:20.303
and then he leads a revolution
with the guys on death row.

43:20.305 --> 43:22.238
- <i>Maniac Cop?</i>
- <i>2.</i>

43:22.240 --> 43:24.073
First one
isn't as political.

43:24.075 --> 43:25.540
Oh, I'll bear that
in mind.

43:25.542 --> 43:29.013
Now, let's get down to
things that matter.

43:30.314 --> 43:32.314
Factions.

43:32.316 --> 43:34.517
Let's assume the factions
in your school

43:34.519 --> 43:37.587
orbit around the ones
you have dubbed slushies.

43:37.589 --> 43:40.223
How is it
that the few

43:40.225 --> 43:42.225
always rule the many?

43:42.227 --> 43:45.662
Two methods:
love and fear.

43:45.664 --> 43:47.596
Many must love
these slushies,

43:47.598 --> 43:49.499
and many more
must fear them.

43:49.501 --> 43:52.200
Either way,
it creates the same effect...

43:52.202 --> 43:55.971
they have power, and they use it
to maintain a stable state.

43:55.973 --> 43:57.506
Sounds about right.

43:57.508 --> 44:00.176
What happens
if you disrupt that power

44:00.178 --> 44:03.011
with swift,
decisive action?

44:03.013 --> 44:04.247
Confusion.

44:04.249 --> 44:06.149
The masses won't have
a figurehead

44:06.151 --> 44:08.084
to love and fear,
and they need one.

44:08.086 --> 44:09.384
It's human nature.

44:09.386 --> 44:11.955
There's infighting,
revolt, chaos.

44:11.957 --> 44:16.058
You must gird yourself
for blood in the streets.

44:16.060 --> 44:18.060
Metaphorically, right?

44:18.062 --> 44:20.229
Oh, yeah.
Metaphorically. Yes.

44:20.231 --> 44:23.433
Some innocents will,
metaphorically, fall.

44:23.435 --> 44:27.035
But this cannot sway
a determined leader.

44:27.037 --> 44:29.973
When the moment is ripe,
like a grape,

44:29.975 --> 44:33.008
you will crush the fruit.

44:33.010 --> 44:35.011
The mere presence
of authority

44:35.013 --> 44:38.113
will return the state
to its natural order.

44:38.115 --> 44:40.616
Have you heard the term
"coup d'etat,"

44:40.618 --> 44:43.618
the seizure of power
from the establishment?

44:43.620 --> 44:45.654
Yeah, we learned about it
in history class.

44:45.656 --> 44:49.861
Well, this could be yours,
your "coup d'Tatiana."

It's the same wiring as
the bombs the enemy drops on us.

46:38.368 --> 46:41.238
Okay, people,
let's move it along.

46:42.307 --> 46:44.506
Mom, keep it in check.

46:44.508 --> 46:47.576
He's not a bad handyman,
for a dictator.

46:47.578 --> 46:50.279
- That's not what I meant.
- Goodbye.

46:50.281 --> 46:52.781
He's got this
sort of... mm...

46:52.783 --> 46:54.616
forceful manliness.

46:54.618 --> 46:56.384
Okay,
that's what I meant.

46:56.386 --> 46:57.886
If you're entertaining
any fantasies about him,

46:57.888 --> 46:59.154
press "delete."

46:59.156 --> 47:03.125
He is the kind of guy who'd
break into your bedroom,

47:03.127 --> 47:04.759
tie you up,
and make you feel...

47:04.761 --> 47:07.529
Ew! That's so gross!
He's like 1,000 years old!

47:07.531 --> 47:10.332
Do you want me to lie?
Fine.

47:10.334 --> 47:12.368
Anton's a wuss.

47:17.508 --> 47:20.411
Peace out.
Stay out of trouble.

47:21.546 --> 47:22.444
Bye.

47:22.446 --> 47:25.281
Excuse me.
Miss Miles?

47:25.283 --> 47:27.582
- That's me.
- Wow.

47:27.584 --> 47:30.653
You and Tatiana
could be sisters.

47:30.655 --> 47:32.455
I'm sorry.
I'm Mr. Spines,

47:32.457 --> 47:34.423
your daughter's
social studies teacher.

47:34.425 --> 47:36.825
Well, aren't you
the yummy one?

47:36.827 --> 47:38.160
I, um, I was wondering

47:38.162 --> 47:40.798
if you'd be interested
in grabbing an herbal tea?

47:42.399 --> 47:44.299
That is so flattering.

47:44.301 --> 47:45.901
I'd love to go
on a date with you.

47:45.903 --> 47:47.770
Oh. Oh, no.

47:47.772 --> 47:51.207
No, I'm sorry. I'm afraid
you have the wrong idea.

47:51.209 --> 47:54.176
No, I wanted to
talk to you about

47:54.178 --> 47:55.845
Tatiana's situation
at home.

47:55.847 --> 47:58.948
I have some concerns,
and I was hoping

47:58.950 --> 48:01.584
I could learn a little more
about her background.

48:01.586 --> 48:03.451
You know what you can
learn about?

48:03.453 --> 48:05.624
How to shove sand
up your ass!

48:12.196 --> 48:13.962
There's more
where that came from.

48:13.964 --> 48:15.800
Way more.

48:19.437 --> 48:23.275
Sarvia Siemers?
My office. Now.

48:49.734 --> 48:50.602
Mr. Willow...

48:52.236 --> 48:54.539
This is my station.
Beat it!

48:56.406 --> 48:58.274
You can start drilling,
Doctor.

48:58.276 --> 48:59.778
Uh...

49:01.345 --> 49:04.346
Jose, hold the sombrero.

49:04.348 --> 49:05.982
Hey, you want to earn
50 bucks

49:05.984 --> 49:07.383
and a six-pack
of Corona?

49:07.385 --> 49:09.819
<i>Oh, sí, señor.
Mucho gracias.</i>

49:09.821 --> 49:12.787
Just do the lawn
and trim the fichus.

49:12.789 --> 49:15.491
Yeah? Oh...

49:15.493 --> 49:18.326
You're not Latino.
I'm sorry.

49:18.328 --> 49:21.631
No, I'm Latino
in spirit.

49:21.633 --> 49:24.267
Uh, either way,
you're a great gardener.

49:24.269 --> 49:25.468
Thank you.

49:25.470 --> 49:27.470
It's about time
the girls had some help.

49:27.472 --> 49:29.772
You know her parents
left her this place, right?

49:29.774 --> 49:32.808
But after two years
of Darlene... disaster.

49:32.810 --> 49:35.544
She's been bringing up
her daughter.

49:35.546 --> 49:37.680
Another disaster.

49:41.051 --> 49:42.817
Jose, where are you going?

49:42.819 --> 49:46.455
How dumb do you have to be
to sign your own name?

49:46.457 --> 49:48.723
It was 20 grand
worth of damage.

49:48.725 --> 49:51.394
She's totally not
capable of that.

49:51.396 --> 49:53.662
Yeah, they found the stencil
in her locker.

49:53.664 --> 49:56.464
I mean, it'll go on her
permanent record for sure.

49:56.466 --> 49:57.769
So embarr...

50:00.972 --> 50:03.673
Holy shit. We're dying.
Tell us everything.

50:03.675 --> 50:05.875
- About what?
- Sarvia. Duh.

50:05.877 --> 50:09.444
- I heard she's getting expelled.
- That is so messed up.

50:09.446 --> 50:11.580
I thought
only dirt-bags tagged.

50:11.582 --> 50:13.716
Maybe 'cause
she is a dirt-bag?

50:13.718 --> 50:16.986
Well if that ain't the tranny
callin' the queen a homo.

50:16.988 --> 50:19.854
Okay, call me whatever you want,
but how come your friend went

50:19.856 --> 50:21.756
and spray-painted
the whole school?

50:21.758 --> 50:24.426
And she forgot
about you, huh?

50:24.428 --> 50:25.995
I didn't see
any "Chivas rules"

50:25.997 --> 50:27.763
- or "Gigi."
- So?

50:27.765 --> 50:28.964
She probably didn't
want to include us

50:28.966 --> 50:30.899
'cause she didn't want
to get us busted.

50:30.901 --> 50:33.102
Or not. Remember Hilton Head?
She got us busted then.

50:33.104 --> 50:36.104
- Fat bitch.
- You're such a backstabber.

50:36.106 --> 50:38.874
Oh, not like it matters.
She's never coming back.

50:38.876 --> 50:41.877
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Oh, excuse me?

50:41.879 --> 50:44.216
You just want to be
top bitch, don't you?

50:51.622 --> 50:54.622
In case you're wondering
why I'm so jazzed,

50:54.624 --> 50:56.959
I got my old job back.

50:56.961 --> 50:58.794
Praise the Lord.

50:58.796 --> 51:00.696
Oh, you've been
a busy bee.

51:00.698 --> 51:02.798
- Mm-hmm.
- The lawn looks great.

51:02.800 --> 51:05.667
I also mowed
your neighbor's grass.

51:05.669 --> 51:08.604
You're a man
of many accomplishments.

51:08.606 --> 51:10.506
- Tatiana?
- Hmm?

51:10.508 --> 51:12.540
Any accomplishments
your end?

51:12.542 --> 51:14.542
Well, if you call
deposing the slushies

51:14.544 --> 51:16.979
an accomplishment,
then yes.

51:16.981 --> 51:18.881
And did you seize power?

51:18.883 --> 51:20.649
Step three.

51:20.651 --> 51:23.752
Hmm. She's not like
most Americans, you know.

51:23.754 --> 51:25.888
They accept
what they are fed.

51:25.890 --> 51:30.526
Mega-plexes, McMansions,
mortgages.

51:30.528 --> 51:34.062
And in the end,
they accept death.

51:34.064 --> 51:35.631
But she will not.

51:35.633 --> 51:37.899
A rebel never accepts.

51:37.901 --> 51:41.069
A rebel questions,
a rebel challenges,

51:41.071 --> 51:43.406
a rebel charges.

51:43.408 --> 51:45.073
And in that event,

51:45.075 --> 51:46.944
she will not die.

51:48.178 --> 51:50.879
You know a lot
about this stuff.

51:50.881 --> 51:52.881
<i>Never give up. Never falter.</i>

51:52.883 --> 51:56.419
- <i>Homeland or death.</i>
- Anton, it's you!

51:56.421 --> 52:00.555
<i>Experts are still investigating
the authenticity of the video...</i>

52:00.557 --> 52:03.526
- I like you better clean-shaven.
- Oh, thank you.

52:03.528 --> 52:05.093
<i>That video was left
anonymously</i>

52:05.095 --> 52:07.196
<i>at On Scene News KSDD.</i>

52:07.198 --> 52:10.098
<i>Now, Vincent's whereabouts
are unknown at this time,</i>

52:10.100 --> 52:13.569
<i>but authorities do suspect
that he could be hiding out</i>

52:13.571 --> 52:15.136
<i>in the mountains
outside of the capital.</i>

52:15.138 --> 52:17.705
<i>Right, and the strange image
of actor Jennifer Lawrence</i>

52:17.707 --> 52:20.209
<i>has prompted the Oscar winner
to step up security.</i>

52:20.211 --> 52:23.178
- <i>Isn't that odd?</i>
- <i>Very. It's a strange story.</i>

52:23.180 --> 52:24.712
It's only a matter of time

52:24.714 --> 52:27.584
before my comrades
contact me.

52:28.852 --> 52:31.754
Tell you what,
let's cook something.

52:31.756 --> 52:34.189
Celebrate all our successes,
you know.

52:34.191 --> 52:36.125
Not American fast food.

52:36.127 --> 52:38.093
Don't get all worked up.
She doesn't cook.

52:38.095 --> 52:40.162
I do.

52:40.164 --> 52:43.131
In the siege of 1992,

52:43.133 --> 52:45.533
we were in the mountains,

52:45.535 --> 52:47.470
and we had to forage for food

52:47.472 --> 52:50.673
and cook it for ourselves.

52:50.675 --> 52:53.843
I-I imagine
you have chocolate.

52:53.845 --> 52:55.611
Always.

52:55.613 --> 52:57.912
Tatiana, in the pocket
of my uniform,

52:57.914 --> 53:01.183
you'll find a dried
cayenne pepper.

53:01.185 --> 53:02.787
- Got it.
- Great.

54:40.117 --> 54:43.151
I had a Latina
come with us,

54:43.153 --> 54:46.354
and this is her famous
mole Maria.

54:46.356 --> 54:48.723
No shit,
I have never seen

54:48.725 --> 54:50.725
anything so pretty.

54:50.727 --> 54:52.727
Mm-mm. Not in this kitchen,
you haven't.

54:52.729 --> 54:54.095
I got to
document this

54:54.097 --> 54:55.866
before we go
and ruin it.

55:10.948 --> 55:13.182
Now I remember
why I don't cook.

55:13.184 --> 55:16.752
It's hard with no help.

55:16.754 --> 55:20.089
Yeah. It's always
just been...

55:20.091 --> 55:22.625
her and me.

55:22.627 --> 55:24.826
Where's your husband?

55:24.828 --> 55:26.763
I never had that.

55:27.897 --> 55:30.332
- You?
- Oh, she passed away.

55:30.334 --> 55:32.801
Oh, shit.

55:32.803 --> 55:34.937
Oh, we were separated
before that.

55:34.939 --> 55:36.272
Oh.

55:36.274 --> 55:40.109
I was a good leader of men
and a bad companion of women.

55:40.111 --> 55:42.176
I'm like you.

55:42.178 --> 55:45.948
I'm... I'm a bad
companion to men.

55:45.950 --> 55:47.785
You're a good leader
of women.

55:49.185 --> 55:51.256
Tatiana has
tremendous potential.

55:52.756 --> 55:54.323
No one's ever said that
to me before.

55:54.325 --> 55:57.060
Then no one's been
paying attention.

55:59.763 --> 56:01.196
I don't know
what it is about you,

56:01.198 --> 56:03.301
but you just make me
want to be better.

56:05.135 --> 56:08.272
- Good night, General Vincent.
- Good night, Miss Miles.

56:24.021 --> 56:26.087
You're not actually
going to eat this crap?

56:26.089 --> 56:28.057
I happen to like
my tacos, bitch.

56:28.059 --> 56:31.060
Oh, how very "street" of you.
I'd rather eat antifreeze.

56:31.062 --> 56:35.330
- You mean "drink."
- Whatever, brain surgeon.

56:35.332 --> 56:36.999
What are you doing?

56:37.001 --> 56:39.401
- Cutting.
- You can't just cut.

56:39.403 --> 56:41.169
Why not?
You do it.

56:41.171 --> 56:43.037
Go back, maxi pad.

56:43.039 --> 56:46.908
I don't use maxi pads,
reject.

56:46.910 --> 56:49.377
Oh, my God. What...
What is she doing?

56:49.379 --> 56:51.846
Uggh!

56:51.848 --> 56:54.249
Here's some ketchup
for your salad.

57:02.059 --> 57:05.060
She totally
Red Lobster'ed you.

57:05.062 --> 57:07.796
Chiv, help me up!

57:07.798 --> 57:10.267
No, you're covered
in nastiness.

57:23.046 --> 57:26.314
Whale tails are the opiates
of the masses!

57:26.316 --> 57:28.151
Oohh....

57:56.546 --> 57:58.046
All right, Teddy,

57:58.048 --> 58:00.314
just count backwards
from 10.

58:00.316 --> 58:03.820
Ten, nine...

58:08.359 --> 58:09.892
Okay.

58:13.830 --> 58:16.497
You said you wanted things to
go back to the way they were.

58:16.499 --> 58:19.234
Right now?

58:19.236 --> 58:21.973
This is the way
things were.

58:31.347 --> 58:33.350
Mm, Dr. Charles.

58:35.852 --> 58:37.819
Oh.

58:37.821 --> 58:40.157
Oh, put your tongue
all over me.

58:42.126 --> 58:45.294
Oh, yeah.
Oh, you're such a man.

58:46.897 --> 58:49.397
<i>Coalition forces
are still searching for clues</i>

58:49.399 --> 58:52.000
<i>to the whereabouts
of Anton Vincent.</i>

58:52.002 --> 58:54.069
Get down! Stay down!

58:54.071 --> 58:56.037
- Stay!
- Don't move! Don't move!

58:56.039 --> 58:58.240
Stay on the ground.
Stay down.

58:58.242 --> 59:00.107
- Why do you have this?
- Stay on the ground.

59:00.109 --> 59:02.845
Why do you have this?
Where'd you get it?

59:02.847 --> 59:05.980
<i>Hey, where'd you get it?
Where'd you get this?</i>

59:05.982 --> 59:08.149
<i>Donde esta?</i>
You guys speak Spanish?

59:10.921 --> 59:12.890
<i>Anton Vincent?</i>

59:13.990 --> 59:16.524
You're back early.

59:16.526 --> 59:19.394
Tough day.
All that jazz.

59:19.396 --> 59:21.263
Look.

59:21.265 --> 59:24.600
I fixed the tap.
No drip.

59:24.602 --> 59:27.002
What do you say

59:27.004 --> 59:28.904
you and I go out
for a couple drinks

59:28.906 --> 59:30.638
and just laugh
our asses off?

59:30.640 --> 59:34.276
Well, I wouldn't want to
put you in any danger.

59:34.278 --> 59:37.247
We'll go somewhere
no one will recognize you.

59:40.316 --> 59:43.051
This is the only place
Charles ever brought me

59:43.053 --> 59:45.223
because he knew his wife
wouldn't show up.

59:46.923 --> 59:49.156
Can you believe it?

59:49.158 --> 59:51.162
Here. Try again.

59:54.031 --> 59:56.298
Oh. At last.

59:56.300 --> 59:59.169
- Well.
- Well, you get an automatic 6.

01:00:01.071 --> 01:00:04.238
- How was his game?
- Charles?

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:07.209
He sucked
worse than you.

01:00:07.211 --> 01:00:09.410
I always had to miss
on purpose.

01:00:09.412 --> 01:00:14.015
Sometimes I wish
I could be a lesbian, you know?

01:00:14.017 --> 01:00:16.218
Like, I have spent

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:19.087
my whole life chasing men,

01:00:19.089 --> 01:00:22.156
like they're gonna come in
and fix all my problems.

01:00:22.158 --> 01:00:24.225
They're men.
I mean, think about it.

01:00:24.227 --> 01:00:27.462
There are no girl rapists
or serial killers...

01:00:27.464 --> 01:00:30.598
except for that one chick
they made a movie about,

01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:33.435
but that doesn't count,
'cause she looked like a dude.

01:00:33.437 --> 01:00:35.604
When was the last time
you heard

01:00:35.606 --> 01:00:37.538
about a woman
child molester?

01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:40.241
Hmm? I mean, like,
when there's an Amber Alert,

01:00:40.243 --> 01:00:42.944
are they ever looking
for a 5'2" blonde

01:00:42.946 --> 01:00:45.180
driving a VW Bug? No!

01:00:45.182 --> 01:00:48.616
Because women don't have
that whole power trip deal.

01:00:48.618 --> 01:00:52.053
I mean, there's never even been
a lady dictator, has there?

01:00:52.055 --> 01:00:55.022
Some women who
married dictators

01:00:55.024 --> 01:00:57.959
carried on after
their husband died.

01:00:57.961 --> 01:01:00.696
But, I mean, I agree with you.
Men have written history,

01:01:00.698 --> 01:01:03.365
not always justly.

01:01:03.367 --> 01:01:05.500
Women who feel
like you do

01:01:05.502 --> 01:01:08.002
should take power.

01:01:08.004 --> 01:01:10.071
And if they do better,

01:01:10.073 --> 01:01:12.108
I'd be the first
to applaud.

01:01:15.044 --> 01:01:17.279
- You're right.
- Wait.

01:01:17.281 --> 01:01:19.413
- What?
- Behind you,

01:01:19.415 --> 01:01:21.216
by the children's
toddler ride.

01:01:21.218 --> 01:01:25.153
Someone
is watching us.

01:01:25.155 --> 01:01:27.057
What do we do?

01:01:27.758 --> 01:01:29.526
Drop your club.

01:01:41.205 --> 01:01:45.107
I paid three cents
for that on Amazon,

01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:47.609
plus the shipping
and handling.

01:01:47.611 --> 01:01:50.511
That should be read
by every military leader.

01:01:50.513 --> 01:01:53.682
Just be careful ordering stuff
on the Internet, okay?

01:01:53.684 --> 01:01:55.716
Now is the time, you know,

01:01:55.718 --> 01:01:58.252
to expand your power base,

01:01:58.254 --> 01:02:00.287
bring your teachers
under your yoke...

01:02:00.289 --> 01:02:02.290
oh, and the, uh,

01:02:02.292 --> 01:02:04.658
the boy in the garage.

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:07.328
- Denny?
- You have emotion for him.

01:02:07.330 --> 01:02:09.698
- He could be a threat.
- Wait. No, no, no.

01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:12.767
First off, I don't have
any emotions for Denny.

01:02:12.769 --> 01:02:15.504
Let's get that straight.
Second, he's too scared

01:02:15.506 --> 01:02:17.406
of his dad to be
a threat to anyone.

01:02:17.408 --> 01:02:19.674
- He's afraid of his father?
- Yeah.

01:02:19.676 --> 01:02:21.676
His dad's, like
a superhero-level Christian.

01:02:21.678 --> 01:02:25.147
I mean, like, he would ground
him for life if he found out

01:02:25.149 --> 01:02:26.247
that he had sex with Sarvia.

01:02:26.249 --> 01:02:29.316
Well, you should
expose him, then.

01:02:29.318 --> 01:02:31.352
No. I could never do that.

01:02:31.354 --> 01:02:34.589
I mean, okay, I am pissed
at him for being an idiot,

01:02:34.591 --> 01:02:37.392
but that would be
way too harsh.

01:02:37.394 --> 01:02:39.528
That's why you do it.

01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:41.529
Making them fear you
is just as good,

01:02:41.531 --> 01:02:43.631
if not better,
than making them love you.

01:02:43.633 --> 01:02:45.332
Aren't you supposed
to be focusing

01:02:45.334 --> 01:02:46.533
on your own revolution
right now?

01:02:46.535 --> 01:02:50.206
I mean, your men
aren't exactly punctual.

01:02:54.410 --> 01:02:56.343
Are you questioning

01:02:56.345 --> 01:02:58.345
the loyalty of my men?

01:02:58.347 --> 01:03:00.549
No, I-I just thought,
like, maybe you had

01:03:00.551 --> 01:03:02.750
your own problems
to deal with.

01:03:02.752 --> 01:03:06.520
They are bivouacking
in the mountains,

01:03:06.522 --> 01:03:09.825
and I could get a communique
from them at any hour.

01:03:09.827 --> 01:03:12.593
Okay. You don't have to
get all hissy.

01:03:12.595 --> 01:03:14.231
I get it.

01:03:31.582 --> 01:03:33.615
Please,

01:03:33.617 --> 01:03:35.250
Father,

01:03:35.252 --> 01:03:37.321
relieve my burden.

01:03:40.656 --> 01:03:42.790
Dennis, get
your heinie down here

01:03:42.792 --> 01:03:44.625
and wash these dishes.

01:03:44.627 --> 01:03:47.164
Coming.
Just saying my prayers.

01:03:52.401 --> 01:03:54.535
Who wins the human race?

01:03:54.537 --> 01:03:55.404
I do.

01:04:09.318 --> 01:04:12.888
<i>♪ That girl thinks she's
the queen of the neighborhood ♪</i>

01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:22.531
Where'd you get that?

01:04:22.533 --> 01:04:25.167
- Good one.
- I'm serious.

01:04:25.169 --> 01:04:27.271
You forwarded it.
To everyone.

01:04:29.305 --> 01:04:30.337
Where's Denny?

01:04:30.339 --> 01:04:32.542
Probably digging
his own grave.

01:04:46.856 --> 01:04:48.656
What?

01:04:48.658 --> 01:04:50.758
Denny,
I didn't do it.

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:51.727
You were supposed to be

01:04:51.729 --> 01:04:54.328
the only other person
who saw it.

01:04:54.330 --> 01:04:56.497
Do you realize
what a bag of crap

01:04:56.499 --> 01:04:58.732
my life is about
to turn into?

01:04:58.734 --> 01:05:00.334
I'm sorry.

01:05:13.883 --> 01:05:16.786
Anton, open up!

01:05:19.555 --> 01:05:21.890
I told you not to mess with
Denny, and you did it anyway.

01:05:21.892 --> 01:05:23.290
You cyber-bullied him.

01:05:23.292 --> 01:05:25.627
That's, like, the worst thing
you can do to someone!

01:05:25.629 --> 01:05:27.895
Oh, I can think
of a few worse things.

01:05:27.897 --> 01:05:31.566
- He thinks I did it.
- You should have.

01:05:31.568 --> 01:05:34.301
"Conscience doth make
cowards of us all."

01:05:34.303 --> 01:05:37.238
That's Hamlet.
A leader for the ages.

01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:39.274
Who got assassinated.

01:05:39.276 --> 01:05:41.479
Yes. A noble end.

01:05:42.511 --> 01:05:44.912
- Screw you!
- You too.

01:05:51.421 --> 01:05:54.622
Pick up.

01:05:54.624 --> 01:05:57.392
Hi, Denny, it's me.

01:05:57.394 --> 01:05:59.928
Look, I swear
I did not leak that video.

01:05:59.930 --> 01:06:02.430
You have no idea how insane
it is over here.

01:06:02.432 --> 01:06:05.569
Please, please, please
call me back, okay? Bye.

01:06:18.548 --> 01:06:20.548
Mom, did you hear that?

01:06:20.550 --> 01:06:23.417
Anton, what's that noise?

01:06:23.419 --> 01:06:25.287
There you go.

01:06:25.289 --> 01:06:26.453
Anton, no!

01:06:26.455 --> 01:06:28.689
What are you doing?

01:06:28.691 --> 01:06:31.493
- He was spying on me.
- Are you milk-boarding him?

01:06:31.495 --> 01:06:33.794
Well, I'm-I'm procuring
information.

01:06:33.796 --> 01:06:36.830
- He's a government agent.
- I know this guy.

01:06:36.832 --> 01:06:38.732
Mr. Spines?

01:06:38.734 --> 01:06:42.370
Mr. Spines? This is
my social studies teacher!

01:06:42.372 --> 01:06:43.437
Damn it.

01:06:45.008 --> 01:06:47.841
I'm sorry! I'm not a spy!

01:06:47.843 --> 01:06:49.711
I'm not a spy!
I'm not a spy!

01:06:49.713 --> 01:06:51.578
I was concerned about Tatiana.

01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:53.647
I thought there might be
some trouble at home,

01:06:53.649 --> 01:06:56.750
so I called Child Protective
Services, and they told me...

01:06:56.752 --> 01:06:59.620
Wait a minute. You called
Child Services on me?!

01:06:59.622 --> 01:07:01.622
Well, no. Well, yeah.

01:07:01.624 --> 01:07:04.591
No, I thought when you refused
to discuss the situation,

01:07:04.593 --> 01:07:06.560
I thought it was a red flag,
so I just...

01:07:06.562 --> 01:07:07.662
But now I can see everything...

01:07:07.664 --> 01:07:09.596
No, everything's
perfectly normal.

01:07:09.598 --> 01:07:12.600
- You were spying on me?
- What? Take my camera.

01:07:12.602 --> 01:07:14.502
I'll tear up the report!
It's all good!

01:07:14.504 --> 01:07:16.504
Mom, no! Mom, stop it!

01:07:16.506 --> 01:07:18.073
Mom, wait! Stop, stop!

01:07:18.075 --> 01:07:19.607
Have you gone
completely bat-shit!

01:07:22.979 --> 01:07:26.948
You think I'm a bad mother?
I'm a seriously bad mother!

01:07:28.952 --> 01:07:31.821
I'm sorry.
I've gotten the wrong man.

01:07:41.497 --> 01:07:43.700
What the hell is wrong
with you people!

01:08:20.837 --> 01:08:22.136
Fraud.

01:08:22.138 --> 01:08:23.904
Excuse me?

01:08:23.906 --> 01:08:26.174
I didn't hear
what you said.

01:08:26.176 --> 01:08:28.777
You are a fraud.

01:08:28.779 --> 01:08:32.179
A fraud is someone
who is pretending to be

01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:34.883
something he isn't.

01:08:34.885 --> 01:08:37.719
I am what I am...

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:40.020
a man with a past,
and certainly

01:08:40.022 --> 01:08:41.990
a man with a future.

01:08:41.992 --> 01:08:43.524
Yeah.

01:08:43.526 --> 01:08:45.160
Torturing innocent dudes
in suburbia.

01:08:45.162 --> 01:08:46.294
What an awesome future.

01:08:46.296 --> 01:08:49.798
It's better that
a man loses his head

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:52.901
than a country
loses a war.

01:08:52.903 --> 01:08:54.001
What war?

01:08:54.002 --> 01:08:56.537
Don't you get it?
The war is over.

01:08:56.538 --> 01:08:58.540
The war is never over.

01:08:58.542 --> 01:08:59.741
There's no one
left to fight.

01:08:59.743 --> 01:09:01.843
What are you gonna do,
blow up my school?

01:09:01.845 --> 01:09:04.144
I am a rebel,
and I will keep going

01:09:04.145 --> 01:09:06.850
until someone stops me.

01:09:07.984 --> 01:09:10.854
You think you're
going to be that someone?

01:09:13.721 --> 01:09:16.590
My daughter Chloe
and I

01:09:16.591 --> 01:09:18.626
are estranged.

01:09:18.627 --> 01:09:20.761
I can see why.

01:09:20.763 --> 01:09:22.863
And she was engaged
to a man

01:09:22.865 --> 01:09:25.934
who we suspected
of treason.

01:09:25.935 --> 01:09:27.602
A dissident.

01:09:27.604 --> 01:09:30.037
A threat to the state.

01:09:30.038 --> 01:09:32.607
And my daughter

01:09:32.609 --> 01:09:34.742
was in love with him.

01:09:34.743 --> 01:09:36.979
So what did you do?

01:09:38.214 --> 01:09:41.115
I had him executed,

01:09:41.117 --> 01:09:44.886
and my daughter spent
three years in prison.

01:09:46.756 --> 01:09:49.122
You must have the courage

01:09:49.124 --> 01:09:52.727
to do what you believe in,

01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:55.196
even if it hurts

01:09:55.198 --> 01:09:57.034
the ones that you love.

01:10:00.035 --> 01:10:03.140
Do you have that kind
of courage, Tatiana?

01:10:07.142 --> 01:10:08.578
Do you?

01:10:11.515 --> 01:10:13.915
That's sad.

01:10:13.917 --> 01:10:17.020
I thought you were a rebel,
but you're just a punk.

01:10:28.198 --> 01:10:30.798
Some jack-wagon
egged our house.

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.966
<i>It has been decades
since these island people</i>

01:10:32.968 --> 01:10:35.836
<i>have seen a free
and fair election.</i>

01:10:35.838 --> 01:10:38.740
<i>Turnout at the polls
is said to be 90%,</i>

01:10:38.742 --> 01:10:41.242
<i>and the mood on the streets
is jubilant.</i>

01:10:41.244 --> 01:10:44.011
<i>It's almost as if
the outcome doesn't matter,</i>

01:10:44.013 --> 01:10:47.081
<i>as long as Anton Vincent
isn't the winner.</i>

01:10:49.052 --> 01:10:51.152
You want some brekkie?
We have, like,

01:10:51.154 --> 01:10:53.554
six different kinds
of sugar cereal,

01:10:53.556 --> 01:10:56.256
and doughnuts.

01:10:56.258 --> 01:10:57.959
These ones
are really good.

01:10:57.961 --> 01:11:00.995
Oh, we got a lot left too.

01:11:00.997 --> 01:11:04.197
Anton?

01:11:04.199 --> 01:11:06.233
Anton!

01:11:06.235 --> 01:11:08.036
Anton, stop!

01:11:08.038 --> 01:11:10.103
Anton! Anton!

01:11:10.105 --> 01:11:12.072
Anton! Anton, stop!

01:11:12.074 --> 01:11:13.575
Anton!

01:11:19.248 --> 01:11:20.950
Hi.

01:11:35.899 --> 01:11:38.666
I am so sorry.
I did not mean that.

01:11:38.668 --> 01:11:40.734
- It's okay.
- I am such a klutz.

01:11:40.736 --> 01:11:42.103
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

01:11:42.105 --> 01:11:44.808
- I am really sorry.
- It's fine.

01:11:56.218 --> 01:11:58.353
Dude, he's gonna jump!

01:11:58.355 --> 01:12:00.755
Who's jumping? Who's jumping?

01:12:00.757 --> 01:12:02.223
- Denny.
- Denny?

01:12:06.029 --> 01:12:07.664
He's gonna jump!

01:12:11.066 --> 01:12:12.634
Denny!

01:12:12.636 --> 01:12:15.636
I have broken divine law!

01:12:15.638 --> 01:12:17.938
I have disobeyed my Father.

01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:20.207
- Denny, get down.
- I realize that by taking

01:12:20.209 --> 01:12:24.144
my own life, I am committing
a second mortal sin.

01:12:24.146 --> 01:12:25.647
That's okay.

01:12:25.649 --> 01:12:28.649
The left leg of hell
is too good for me.

01:12:28.651 --> 01:12:30.385
I want to go all the way
to the stomach,

01:12:30.387 --> 01:12:32.219
where the worst people go!

01:12:32.221 --> 01:12:34.988
Denny, stop!

01:12:34.990 --> 01:12:36.158
No!

01:12:45.668 --> 01:12:48.169
What is wrong with you?
Stop it!

01:12:48.171 --> 01:12:50.138
Ow! Ow!

01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:51.438
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:54.845
Ow. This hurts.

01:12:56.212 --> 01:13:00.081
Ow! My legs, uh,
I think they're broken.

01:13:00.083 --> 01:13:01.381
Ow. Ow. Ow.

01:13:01.383 --> 01:13:05.118
Somebody call 911.

01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:09.924
What's with all the hoopla?

01:13:09.926 --> 01:13:13.126
Denny tried to kill himself.
He jumped off the roof.

01:13:13.128 --> 01:13:14.828
Of the school?

01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:16.863
That's not even
two stories.

01:13:16.865 --> 01:13:19.901
Yeah, that's why he didn't die.
He just broke a bunch of bones.

01:13:19.903 --> 01:13:23.103
- Not the sharpest knife, is he?
- Mom, stop.

01:13:23.105 --> 01:13:25.072
- Guess what.
- What?

01:13:25.074 --> 01:13:27.875
Anton thinks that
I could actually

01:13:27.877 --> 01:13:29.710
become a real dentist.

01:13:29.712 --> 01:13:31.179
- Oh, does he?
- Yeah.

01:13:31.181 --> 01:13:32.112
Oh.

01:13:32.114 --> 01:13:34.849
I guess
in his country,

01:13:34.851 --> 01:13:37.251
there's more doctors
per capita than any other

01:13:37.253 --> 01:13:39.252
country in the whole world.
Can you believe that?

01:13:39.254 --> 01:13:41.054
Yeah, that's 'cause all
the idiots who get rejected

01:13:41.056 --> 01:13:43.057
for med school here
go there.

01:13:43.059 --> 01:13:46.027
Why do you have to be
such a downer?

01:13:46.029 --> 01:13:49.162
Anton thinks that
I can do it, and...

01:13:49.164 --> 01:13:51.933
you know, I feel really good
about my knowledge of teeth.

01:13:51.935 --> 01:13:53.901
Anton is a liar.

01:13:53.903 --> 01:13:55.870
I looked him up
on Wikipedia, okay?

01:13:55.872 --> 01:13:58.139
He is not the great
revolutionary he claims to be.

01:13:58.141 --> 01:14:00.174
- Don't say that.
- Did you know that he was

01:14:00.176 --> 01:14:02.477
handed the job
from his dictator dad?

01:14:02.479 --> 01:14:05.078
And this whole rebel thing?
That's bullshit.

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:06.880
He fought one battle
in the mountains

01:14:06.882 --> 01:14:09.149
from a helicopter.

01:14:09.151 --> 01:14:12.853
Oh, Christ.
I'm not even speeding.

01:14:12.855 --> 01:14:15.857
You don't think they're
looking for Anton, do you?

01:14:15.859 --> 01:14:17.192
If they tracked his

01:14:17.194 --> 01:14:19.292
eight zillion emails,
it wouldn't be a shocker.

01:14:19.294 --> 01:14:21.328
I thought you were
being careful.

01:14:21.330 --> 01:14:22.830
I was being careful.

01:14:22.832 --> 01:14:24.131
He's the one
on the Internet 24-7.

01:14:24.133 --> 01:14:25.367
You were supposed
to be helping him.

01:14:25.369 --> 01:14:28.236
He doesn't know
the Internet like you do!

01:14:29.372 --> 01:14:32.305
If they don't have
their flashers on,

01:14:32.307 --> 01:14:34.075
I don't have to
pull over, right?

01:14:34.077 --> 01:14:35.542
That's the law, isn't it?
Look it up.

01:14:35.544 --> 01:14:37.913
Just pull in
and act normal.

01:15:14.484 --> 01:15:16.951
I picked up some ingredients
for fried bananas.

01:15:16.953 --> 01:15:19.152
You see, the secret
is in the oil.

01:15:19.154 --> 01:15:21.923
- See how it caramelizes?
- Mm-hmm.

01:15:21.925 --> 01:15:24.157
Smell it.

01:15:24.159 --> 01:15:25.326
Mm.

01:15:28.964 --> 01:15:30.965
They're all over the place.

01:15:30.967 --> 01:15:32.934
Anton, I told you.

01:15:32.936 --> 01:15:34.568
We have to hide you.
Come on.

01:15:36.105 --> 01:15:37.136
Oh, my God!
What are we gonna do?

01:15:37.138 --> 01:15:40.508
Darlene, I am not
afraid to face them.

01:15:40.510 --> 01:15:42.376
They will extradite me,

01:15:42.378 --> 01:15:45.412
and my people
will welcome me home.

01:15:47.016 --> 01:15:48.849
Please, Anton,
just stay inside.

01:15:48.851 --> 01:15:50.084
Mom,
stop it.

01:15:50.086 --> 01:15:51.419
I don't want you
to go out there.

01:15:51.421 --> 01:15:53.520
Just let him go!
You're gonna get us all killed!

01:15:53.522 --> 01:15:55.590
Shh!

01:16:02.998 --> 01:16:06.367
Exit the house
with your hands raised.

01:16:10.172 --> 01:16:12.173
This is
your final warning.

01:16:12.175 --> 01:16:14.744
Come out of the house now.

01:16:18.647 --> 01:16:22.617
Sir, he's standing there
with his arms raised!

01:16:22.619 --> 01:16:25.518
Ma'am, remain inside.

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:28.257
Well, what more
do you want from him?

01:16:30.159 --> 01:16:34.327
We don't want the grandpa,
we want the girl.

01:16:34.329 --> 01:16:36.229
What girl?

01:16:36.231 --> 01:16:38.534
Tatiana Louise Miles.

01:16:44.172 --> 01:16:47.073
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.

01:16:47.075 --> 01:16:49.546
Come out now,
or we're coming in.

01:17:12.101 --> 01:17:13.968
"Check it out, homies.

01:17:13.970 --> 01:17:16.002
Hashtag slutbag,

01:17:16.004 --> 01:17:17.071
hashtag...

01:17:17.073 --> 01:17:20.073
druggie in da houzzz."

01:17:20.075 --> 01:17:22.276
That was your email.

01:17:22.278 --> 01:17:23.376
Anton said that.

01:17:23.378 --> 01:17:25.211
I would never hashtag
in an email.

01:17:25.213 --> 01:17:27.081
- No one would.
- Excuse me?

01:17:27.083 --> 01:17:29.716
That e-blast was sent from

01:17:29.718 --> 01:17:31.218
your daughter's computer.

01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:32.486
Well, how do you know
she sent it?

01:17:32.488 --> 01:17:34.721
Somebody else
could've sent it.

01:17:34.723 --> 01:17:35.822
It's unlikely.

01:17:35.824 --> 01:17:38.259
Okay, let's say
she did send it...

01:17:38.261 --> 01:17:41.295
which she didn't,
but let's say she did...

01:17:41.297 --> 01:17:43.630
is it a crime
to send an email?

01:17:43.632 --> 01:17:46.634
That depends on the content.
Two teens in bed?

01:17:46.636 --> 01:17:50.203
Both over 18, perv.

01:17:50.205 --> 01:17:52.406
And under covers.
You can't even see anything.

01:17:52.408 --> 01:17:54.140
Did you know
your daughter secretly

01:17:54.142 --> 01:17:56.309
idolized Anton Vincent,
the dictator?

01:17:56.311 --> 01:17:58.979
She wrote as many as
five letters to him,

01:17:58.981 --> 01:18:01.314
letters she believed
he was answering.

01:18:01.316 --> 01:18:03.517
You used
this very computer

01:18:03.519 --> 01:18:06.620
to try to contact
Vincent's associates,

01:18:06.622 --> 01:18:08.255
known arms dealers.

01:18:08.257 --> 01:18:09.523
Your hard drive

01:18:09.525 --> 01:18:12.193
shows inquiries
about assault rifles,

01:18:12.195 --> 01:18:15.161
shoulder-launched missiles,
anti-aircraft ordnance.

01:18:15.163 --> 01:18:17.197
You think
she was gonna use

01:18:17.199 --> 01:18:19.332
anti-aircraft ordnance
on the school?

01:18:19.334 --> 01:18:22.370
It's possible.
There were battle plans

01:18:22.372 --> 01:18:25.171
in your garage,
detailing

01:18:25.173 --> 01:18:28.442
a revolution against
teachers and students.

01:18:28.444 --> 01:18:30.577
No, that was a social
revolution,

01:18:30.579 --> 01:18:32.013
like in <i>Mean Girls?</i>

01:18:32.015 --> 01:18:33.313
Miss Miles,

01:18:33.315 --> 01:18:35.448
I love <i>Mean Girls</i>
as much as the next guy.

01:18:35.450 --> 01:18:38.352
I wish to God
we could go back to a time

01:18:38.354 --> 01:18:40.621
when Regina George
on diet pills was scary,

01:18:40.623 --> 01:18:42.790
but those days
are gone forever.

01:18:42.792 --> 01:18:46.093
The Plastics aren't
a threat we care about.

01:18:46.095 --> 01:18:48.261
Plastic <i>explosives...</i>

01:18:48.263 --> 01:18:50.031
now, that's a threat.

01:18:50.033 --> 01:18:53.200
So, tell us,

01:18:53.202 --> 01:18:55.402
are you hiding weaponry?

01:18:55.404 --> 01:18:57.170
No. I don't have
any weaponry.

01:18:57.172 --> 01:18:59.639
You surfed a Web site
called "Commando Wholesale."

01:18:59.641 --> 01:19:02.175
You bid on, and won,

01:19:02.177 --> 01:19:05.578
a used Soviet T-72 tank!

01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:07.581
What are you hiding,
little girl?

01:19:07.583 --> 01:19:09.649
- Not a tank.
- You're hiding something!

01:19:09.651 --> 01:19:10.654
What is it?

01:19:11.988 --> 01:19:14.220
<i>This is Detective Spano.</i>

01:19:14.222 --> 01:19:16.122
<i>You got anything solid?</i>

01:19:16.124 --> 01:19:19.059
We got nothing.

01:19:19.061 --> 01:19:21.594
<i>Nothing here.</i>

01:19:21.596 --> 01:19:24.398
- We're out of here.
- You're free to go,

01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:26.399
but that doesn't mean
you're free.

01:19:26.401 --> 01:19:28.471
- We'll be watching you.
- Yeah.

01:19:31.406 --> 01:19:33.773
You heard what they said.
Come on.

01:19:33.775 --> 01:19:35.542
I am hiding something.

01:19:35.544 --> 01:19:37.577
- Assault rifles.
- Shoulder-launched missiles.

01:19:37.579 --> 01:19:40.516
I'm not hiding weapons,
you morons.

01:19:42.318 --> 01:19:44.551
I'm hiding a man.
No, Mom, I'm doing this!

01:19:44.553 --> 01:19:47.353
No, my daughter, she's under
duress, and she doesn't know...

01:19:47.355 --> 01:19:49.622
Anton Vincent has been
living in our house.

01:19:49.624 --> 01:19:52.393
No! Don't listen to her.
You said it yourself...

01:19:52.395 --> 01:19:55.429
She believes that he's writing
her letters. She's delusional!

01:19:55.431 --> 01:19:57.398
You're the one
who's delusional, Mom!

01:19:57.400 --> 01:19:59.700
Can't you see that
he wants us to turn him in?

01:19:59.702 --> 01:20:01.268
You can't see
what he's capable of,

01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:02.402
because you're totally
in love with him!

01:20:02.404 --> 01:20:04.205
I am not in love with him!

01:20:04.207 --> 01:20:06.173
What do you think?
He's gonna move in,

01:20:06.175 --> 01:20:07.340
he's gonna fix
all the broken shit,

01:20:07.342 --> 01:20:09.777
he's gonna screw you
and ask you to marry him?

01:20:09.779 --> 01:20:10.747
Shut up!

01:20:17.119 --> 01:20:19.353
Um,

01:20:19.355 --> 01:20:21.658
you still got a 20
on the grandpa?

01:20:28.763 --> 01:20:30.497
Wow.
This is a lot nicer

01:20:30.499 --> 01:20:33.166
than the rehab center
my mom went to.

01:20:33.168 --> 01:20:36.303
Yeah, it's pretty nice.

01:20:36.305 --> 01:20:39.273
So, he told them that
he was holding us hostage,

01:20:39.275 --> 01:20:41.375
and he forced me to do things
I would never do,

01:20:41.377 --> 01:20:43.810
so basically,
they dropped the charges.

01:20:43.812 --> 01:20:46.147
Sounds like
an upstanding dude.

01:20:46.149 --> 01:20:48.816
Kinda,
for a dictator.

01:20:48.818 --> 01:20:51.684
So, um,

01:20:51.686 --> 01:20:53.286
about Sarvia...

01:20:53.288 --> 01:20:55.457
Yeah. I'm an idiot.

01:20:58.694 --> 01:20:59.960
Um, listen,

01:20:59.962 --> 01:21:02.295
if you really liked her,
she seems like a nice girl,

01:21:02.297 --> 01:21:03.496
and maybe I didn't
give her a chance.

01:21:03.498 --> 01:21:05.432
You gave her a chance.

01:21:05.434 --> 01:21:07.537
And she's not so awesome.

01:21:11.173 --> 01:21:14.308
Did I wreck everything?

01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:17.710
If there ever was a chance
for me and you,

01:21:17.712 --> 01:21:20.514
did I blow it?

01:21:20.516 --> 01:21:22.316
No.

01:21:22.318 --> 01:21:24.318
But maybe we should
take it slow,

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:26.187
you know,
see where it all goes.

01:21:26.189 --> 01:21:27.723
- Slow's good.
- Yeah.

01:21:29.324 --> 01:21:30.758
- Ow.
- Sorry.

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:32.361
- Kidding.
- Okay.

01:21:53.682 --> 01:21:55.883
They're not torturing you
or anything, are they?

01:21:55.885 --> 01:21:59.622
Only the food.
It's worse than your mother's.

01:22:00.789 --> 01:22:02.855
"I am tied to the stake,

01:22:02.857 --> 01:22:04.892
but I stand by the cause."

01:22:04.894 --> 01:22:06.762
<i>Hamlet.</i>

01:22:08.230 --> 01:22:09.796
<i>King Lear.</i>

01:22:09.798 --> 01:22:11.868
More apropos.

01:22:14.604 --> 01:22:16.370
- Ah.
- This might help.

01:22:24.346 --> 01:22:25.714
Delicious.

01:22:29.517 --> 01:22:31.587
I wrote to my daughter.

01:22:32.622 --> 01:22:35.892
I only did it
because of you.

01:22:39.262 --> 01:22:41.464
I'm the one
who turned you in.

01:22:43.031 --> 01:22:44.798
I know.

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:46.532
Well, I mean, it's your fault.
You're the one

01:22:46.534 --> 01:22:48.537
who told me to stand up
for what I believe in.

01:22:49.538 --> 01:22:51.938
I'm proud of you, Tatiana.

01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:53.474
Why?

01:22:53.476 --> 01:22:56.546
Because you became a rebel.

01:22:58.314 --> 01:23:00.383
You found your voice.

01:23:02.752 --> 01:23:04.754
Use it wisely.

01:23:23.004 --> 01:23:24.604
How'd it go?

01:23:24.606 --> 01:23:27.476
Did I do the right thing?

01:23:29.912 --> 01:23:32.714
Not that I have any
experience with it, but...

01:23:34.850 --> 01:23:37.520
if it was hard, it was
probably the right thing.

01:23:40.422 --> 01:23:42.456
I got to make a stop.

01:23:42.458 --> 01:23:43.857
- Where?
- Charles.

01:23:43.859 --> 01:23:46.859
Seriously? You're NOT making me
spy on him again. I'm not...

01:23:46.861 --> 01:23:51.400
Pipe down. It's a different
kind of mission.

01:23:56.872 --> 01:23:58.738
Okay, Sharon,
everything's looking...

01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:00.607
- Charles?
- Darlene!

01:24:00.609 --> 01:24:02.009
You said you didn't want
the Saturday...

01:24:02.011 --> 01:24:04.010
I don't want any shift.

01:24:04.012 --> 01:24:05.778
I'm here to quit.

01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:08.717
FYI, your dentist here,
he likes to suck feet.

01:24:12.721 --> 01:24:15.488
<i>Anton Vincent was extradited
to his homeland today.</i>

01:24:15.490 --> 01:24:17.057
<i>Charged with crimes
against humanity,</i>

01:24:17.059 --> 01:24:20.661
<i>the one-time strongman will
face a military tribunal.</i>

01:24:20.663 --> 01:24:22.629
<i>A coup forced
Papa Vincent,</i>

01:24:22.631 --> 01:24:24.697
<i>as he was known,
into exile.</i>

01:24:24.699 --> 01:24:26.700
<i>He fled to the United States
but was captured</i>

01:24:26.702 --> 01:24:29.902
<i>when his mother-daughter
hostages managed to escape.</i>

01:24:29.904 --> 01:24:32.473
<i>On Scene Now News is live</i>

01:24:32.475 --> 01:24:33.840
<i>with reaction.</i>

01:24:33.842 --> 01:24:36.376
<i>You girls have been through
a huge ordeal.</i>

01:24:36.378 --> 01:24:38.379
<i>Do you care to comment?</i>

01:24:38.381 --> 01:24:40.413
<i>It's been completely
life-changing.</i>

01:24:40.415 --> 01:24:43.082
<i>I honestly think
I have PTSD.</i>

01:24:43.084 --> 01:24:45.818
<i>You'd think the leader of
a country wouldn't cyber-bully,</i>

01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:47.920
<i>but, like,
he totally did.</i>

01:24:47.922 --> 01:24:49.723
<i>You know, he seemed like
a pretty nice guy,</i>

01:24:49.725 --> 01:24:51.892
<i>until he did this
to my fichus.</i>

01:24:51.894 --> 01:24:53.660
<i>Oh, you don't even want
to see my lawn.</i>

01:24:53.662 --> 01:24:55.862
<i>And I think he stole
my lawn mower.</i>

01:25:00.936 --> 01:25:02.672
Come on.

01:25:07.008 --> 01:25:08.944
Let's eat.

01:25:11.012 --> 01:25:13.080
Mole Maria,

01:25:13.082 --> 01:25:14.851
in honor of him.

01:25:20.890 --> 01:25:24.425
Hmm. This actually
isn't half bad.

01:25:24.427 --> 01:25:26.527
A compliment.

01:25:26.529 --> 01:25:28.562
Relax.
All I said was,

01:25:28.564 --> 01:25:30.700
"Isn't half bad."

01:25:32.534 --> 01:25:34.568
Not half bad...

01:25:34.570 --> 01:25:36.569
is half good,

01:25:36.571 --> 01:25:39.042
so I'll take it
as a compliment.

01:25:46.848 --> 01:25:49.952
I guess your pal
got his pen back.

01:25:55.658 --> 01:25:57.760
There's one for you too.
