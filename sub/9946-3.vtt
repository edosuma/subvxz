of the lives they were given
by 'im upstairs.

00:13.880 --> 00:17.879
And kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:17.880 --> 00:20.759
What sounds on earth

00:20.760 --> 00:24.759
could ever replace kids needing
money or wives in your face.

00:25.600 --> 00:28.239
Cos this people reckon
and me included

00:28.240 --> 00:32.238
is why pubs and drugs
were kindly invented.

00:33.160 --> 00:36.879
To calm us all down
and stop us going mental.

00:36.880 --> 00:40.559
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:40.560 --> 00:44.559
We are worth every penny.
Grinding your axes

00:45.680 --> 00:49.679
You shit on our head.
But you pay the taxes.

00:52.720 --> 00:56.719
Imagine a Britain without
Chatsworth buccaneers

00:56.800 --> 00:59.239
who'd come on your face
for the price of a beer.

00:59.240 --> 01:00.919
Make poverty history.

01:00.920 --> 01:02.679

old mate Kenny Morris had a Suzuki.'

We're not capitalising.

Better than 50 quid a month
for some sweaty gym.

02:29.240 --> 02:33.239
And I guarantee they'll love it.
What do you think?

02:33.560 --> 02:37.559
You need your head testing.

are usually two completely
different things, Carl.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.559
Thought you'd know that by now.

05:42.560 --> 05:46.439
I said no!

05:46.440 --> 05:49.519
You've got to learn to
attend to her needs, Carl.

can work that one out.

05:55.600 --> 05:58.159

Nothing.

09:20.040 --> 09:21.199
What?

09:21.200 --> 09:23.119
It's got nothing to do with him!

09:23.120 --> 09:24.879
Nothing to do with what?

09:24.880 --> 09:26.959
Don't give me that crap!
I borrowed the money, not him!

09:26.960 --> 09:27.999
Don't give me that crap!
I borrowed the money, not him!
Cool it, Yvonne.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.039
So if you're going to smash
anybody's face in it should be mine.

09:30.040 --> 09:31.839
So if you're going to smash
anybody's face in it should be mine.
I don't know what you're on about!

09:31.840 --> 09:33.559
Stan! He's battered!

09:33.560 --> 09:35.559
That's got nothing to do with me...

09:35.560 --> 09:38.159
I just need a bit more time.

09:38.160 --> 09:42.159

just blanking me.

12:04.240 --> 12:05.359
It's a lot to take on board, mate.

12:05.360 --> 12:08.279
What? A few pints and I missed
a dinner with the in-laws?

12:08.280 --> 12:12.279
Big fuckin' deal.

12:47.280 --> 12:51.279

Hi!

13:09.200 --> 13:10.479
Hi.

13:10.480 --> 13:13.399
Wanna get the tram into town?
Get a burger or something?

13:13.400 --> 13:14.439
Can't.

13:14.440 --> 13:15.519
Why not?

13:15.520 --> 13:16.559
Not allowed.

13:16.560 --> 13:17.639
Veggie?

13:17.640 --> 13:20.239
Knife crime. Dad thinks
I'll end up getting stabbed.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.519

Protect me?

13:24.520 --> 13:27.799
Do my best.

13:27.800 --> 13:30.799
Fancy coming to mine for tea?

13:30.800 --> 13:34.799
It's just tea, Liam,
not a marriage proposal...

13:46.040 --> 13:48.559
Bad move, borrowing off a Maguire.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.479
I had no choice.

13:50.480 --> 13:53.479
Only way I could pay to get
this lot fixed after the fire.

13:53.480 --> 13:57.479
The bank won't touch me.

14:02.520 --> 14:06.519
I can help.

14:10.320 --> 14:12.319
Do you mind if I kiss
you before we go in?

14:12.320 --> 14:13.399
Yeah. I mean...

14:13.400 --> 14:14.479
What about your dad?

14:14.480 --> 14:18.479
I'd sooner kiss you...

14:30.720 --> 14:34.719
So what does your mother do, Liam?

14:35.520 --> 14:37.039
She's a nurse.

14:37.040 --> 14:37.679
And what about your father?

14:37.680 --> 14:39.359
And what about your father?
He passed away.

14:39.360 --> 14:40.959
Sorry, son.

14:40.960 --> 14:42.879
It's not your fault.
It was a long time ago.

14:42.880 --> 14:46.879
Do you remember him?

14:47.800 --> 14:49.839
He was a doctor.

14:49.840 --> 14:52.119
Family of medics, eh?

14:52.120 --> 14:54.719
He was a heart specialist.
Consulted in unexplained

14:54.720 --> 14:56.359
coronaries in young adults.

14:56.360 --> 14:57.919
Really?

14:57.920 --> 15:00.399
Pioneered three drugs
trials at the MRI.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.679
He was up for two
clinical excellence awards.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.599
When they gave him a three-page
spread in The Lancet,

15:09.600 --> 15:11.439
we realised he was something special.

15:11.440 --> 15:13.919
He was up for an MBE but
he was against the monarchy.

15:13.920 --> 15:17.919
Said they were all a bunch of
overpaid, over-privileged idiots.

15:19.480 --> 15:22.199
That's the only thing
we disagreed on.

15:22.200 --> 15:24.399
Personally I'm all
for the Royal Family.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.839
A ray of light in such dark times.

15:26.840 --> 15:30.839
Where they lead, we follow.
Don't you think?

15:32.720 --> 15:35.319
Is it OK if me and Liam go
upstairs? Listen to some music?

15:35.320 --> 15:38.079
I think its probably best I
get Liam back home now, Holly.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.879
It's fine thanks, I'll walk.

15:39.880 --> 15:43.879
Don't be silly, where do you live?

15:52.920 --> 15:56.919
Thanks!

16:18.160 --> 16:19.399
You should go and see her.

16:19.400 --> 16:22.999
What's she said?

16:23.000 --> 16:24.639
It's about her mum and dad.

16:24.640 --> 16:27.439
She can piss off.
I've said sorry. I'm not grovelling.

16:27.440 --> 16:30.319
Carl, I'm only trying to help you.
You get yourself a proper

16:30.320 --> 16:31.919
bird for once then you fuck it
all up is that what you want?

16:31.920 --> 16:35.919
bird for once then you fuck it
all up is that what you want?
Who says I've fucked it up?

16:36.800 --> 16:38.359
Just go and see her.

16:38.360 --> 16:42.359
Talk to her. If you don't
you'll end up losing her.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.279
Pint and two vowels, Karen.

16:50.280 --> 16:53.999
Mimi?

16:54.000 --> 16:56.039
Mimi?

16:56.040 --> 16:58.999
Isn't that enough
practice for one day?

16:59.000 --> 17:02.279
You can make yourself
useful if you like? Clear glasses!

17:02.280 --> 17:05.159
This is useful!

17:05.160 --> 17:07.479
Have you seen what it does
for your triceps?

17:07.480 --> 17:11.479
I don't want bingo
wings at my age do I?

17:17.680 --> 17:21.679
One baby comes into the world
and another brain departs.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.919
Here we go.

17:23.920 --> 17:27.919
As the foetus gestates, it sucks
every bit of goodness from its host.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.279
Protein and calcium.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.679
Vitamins and minerals.

17:32.680 --> 17:36.679
And ounce by ounce as the
baby grows, its mother shrinks

17:38.120 --> 17:40.439
in equal proportion.

17:40.440 --> 17:43.239
(Hello!)

17:43.240 --> 17:45.039
Cut the crap, Frank.

17:45.040 --> 17:49.039

the fridge when she was up the duff.

17:58.560 --> 18:02.559

18:05.640 --> 18:08.879
Do you miss her?

18:08.880 --> 18:10.559
I do.

18:10.560 --> 18:14.559
When she left,
it took me a long, long time to

18:15.400 --> 18:19.399
even begin to come to terms with it.

18:19.560 --> 18:20.999
A good...

18:21.000 --> 18:22.439
few days.

18:22.440 --> 18:25.519
Maybe even a week.

18:25.520 --> 18:27.519
Had this pain...

18:27.520 --> 18:31.519
you see in my chest.

18:31.840 --> 18:35.199
and it made me realise,
it made me understand,

18:35.200 --> 18:37.359
what love is,

18:37.360 --> 18:41.359
what it must be, if it exists,
cos when she was gone...

18:46.560 --> 18:50.559
I made myself feel better
trying to understand the madness,

18:51.200 --> 18:54.199
I missed it.

18:54.200 --> 18:57.239
I even started washing my
hands after taking a piss.

18:57.240 --> 19:00.199
Was she hard to live with?
To cope with...

19:00.200 --> 19:02.199
Fucking nightmare.

19:02.200 --> 19:06.199
But no worse than the
rest of us though. Eh?

19:15.880 --> 19:19.879
You are nothing like her, Karen.

19:21.480 --> 19:24.679
Don't believe that
bollocks about we all eventually

19:24.680 --> 19:26.799
end up turning into our parents.

19:26.800 --> 19:29.879
Cos if it were true,
I'd be an uptight twat

19:29.880 --> 19:33.879
with a penchant for Shirley Bassey.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.839
Thanks.

19:51.840 --> 19:55.839
S'all right...

19:57.120 --> 19:59.159
How do you know when
things are moving too fast?

19:59.160 --> 20:01.199
With a girl.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.719
Blimey.

20:02.720 --> 20:05.439
If you love her?

20:05.440 --> 20:06.959
Do you love her?

20:06.960 --> 20:07.999
I think so.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.719
Have you bought her a soft toy yet?

20:10.720 --> 20:11.759
As if.

20:11.760 --> 20:15.759
Oh, well,
it's not quite love yet, then.

20:16.280 --> 20:19.159
She's nicked one of my pens.

20:19.160 --> 20:21.239
Has she?
That's serious.

20:21.240 --> 20:23.079
So you reckon I
should buy her a teddy?

20:26.200 --> 20:28.199
Ian said I'll lose you.

20:28.200 --> 20:32.199
You better go up, love.

20:35.720 --> 20:39.359
I should've known myself.

20:39.360 --> 20:43.359
Not have him tell me.

20:43.480 --> 20:47.479
Told you what?

20:48.240 --> 20:52.119
That if I carry on
like this I'll lose ya.

20:52.120 --> 20:55.959
There's no point going
over it, is there?

20:55.960 --> 20:57.439
You're right.

20:57.440 --> 21:00.079
Cut the crap, Carl.
Show her how you feel.

21:00.080 --> 21:04.079
Buy her a stuffed puppy or something.

21:05.240 --> 21:07.599
You're the first girl
I've ever said this to.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.279
Leave it, Carl.

21:09.280 --> 21:13.279
I love you.

21:13.640 --> 21:17.639
I want to be with you.
I can't stop thinking about ya.

21:18.640 --> 21:22.639
I never meant for it to go this far.

21:23.040 --> 21:25.919
I'm sorry about your mum and dad.

21:25.920 --> 21:27.399
You don't need to be.

21:27.400 --> 21:31.399
I know how much they mean to you.
I could've fucked that up.

21:34.160 --> 21:38.159
Don't want to come between them
and their little girl, do I?

21:40.000 --> 21:43.999
Daddy's little princess.

21:52.720 --> 21:56.719
I've had an abortion.

22:11.880 --> 22:15.879
Carl?

22:21.440 --> 22:23.479
when you're in love?

22:23.480 --> 22:24.519
You just do.

22:24.520 --> 22:28.519
Have sweaty palms got
anything to do with it?

22:28.760 --> 22:31.359
That is our plumber.

22:31.360 --> 22:31.759
Him?

22:31.760 --> 22:34.639
Him?
Hundred quid and he'll hold
your hand in Pizza Express.

22:34.640 --> 22:36.199
Extortion.

22:36.200 --> 22:37.999
I'm gonna bring him here.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.879
Get a takeaway. Give him
something proper to hold on to.

22:40.880 --> 22:43.039
Cheaper to fuck than to mend a pipe?

22:43.040 --> 22:47.039
You would, though. Wouldn't ya?

22:59.040 --> 23:00.159
(LAUGHS)

23:00.160 --> 23:04.079
What the fuck are you up to?

23:04.080 --> 23:05.879
Rosemary Conley had it right.

23:05.880 --> 23:07.679
She just laid off the cheese.

23:07.680 --> 23:09.479
Moved around a bit.

23:09.480 --> 23:12.199
Got thinner legs!
Hey presto!

23:12.200 --> 23:14.439
She made millions.

23:14.440 --> 23:16.479
Now that's enterprise. Women come up

23:16.480 --> 23:20.479
to me and tell me I look amazing
for a bird that's just dropped a kid.

23:20.920 --> 23:21.959
Yeah, well you do.

23:21.960 --> 23:25.319
I knew I was special.
Like Madonna special. Or Kylie.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.479
Come on you're better than that.

23:27.480 --> 23:30.319
This is my empire, Jamie.

23:30.320 --> 23:34.319
Boing...

24:07.440 --> 24:10.319
What you rattling about
at this hour for?

24:10.320 --> 24:12.759
What she been doing? It's not
normal.

24:12.760 --> 24:14.359
She's fine.

24:14.360 --> 24:16.399
She isn't fine!

24:16.400 --> 24:19.319
Even Frank friggin'
Gallagher's noticed.

24:19.320 --> 24:21.359
People can see it you know!
Why can't you?

24:21.360 --> 24:24.759
Get your father and the lads,
we need to look for her.

24:24.760 --> 24:26.679
Leave it.

24:26.680 --> 24:29.319
That's my grandson that's out there!

24:29.320 --> 24:33.319
And she's my wife!
Now just fuck off!

24:59.890 --> 25:03.769
Karen, everything OK?

25:03.770 --> 25:05.849
Could do with a bit of a hand.

25:05.850 --> 25:08.089
It's a bit early to
be shopping, isn't it?

25:08.090 --> 25:09.209
Once Connor's awake, I'm awake.

25:09.210 --> 25:11.689
Karen where the fuck've you been?

25:11.690 --> 25:14.329
I've been shopping.
Got you some custard tarts.

25:14.330 --> 25:15.529
You didn't bring your mobile.

25:15.530 --> 25:17.169
Who am I going to
call at this time?

25:17.170 --> 25:18.529
For fuck's sake, Karen.

25:18.530 --> 25:19.809
You're over reacting.

25:19.810 --> 25:21.329
You've been gone all night!

25:21.330 --> 25:24.729
Get a grip. He's going to
have me micro-chipped next.

25:24.730 --> 25:25.769
Is he ok?

25:26.970 --> 25:28.609
Anything could've happened.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.649
Have you seen the CCTV in there?

25:30.650 --> 25:33.649
They've got a separate camera over
the disposable razors

25:33.650 --> 25:36.889
because apparently they're the most
nicked item from supermarkets.

25:36.890 --> 25:39.569
Did you know that?
You'd think it would be perfume.

25:39.570 --> 25:42.009
Or cellulite cream. Wouldn't ya?

25:42.010 --> 25:44.729
Let's just go home.

25:44.730 --> 25:48.729
Fine.

25:52.650 --> 25:56.649
You all cheered up now, eh?

26:02.770 --> 26:04.609
You didn't even give me the chance.

26:04.610 --> 26:08.209
If I'd've known I was going to be
a dad I might've started to act
like one.

26:08.210 --> 26:10.889
It wouldn't have made
any difference.

26:10.890 --> 26:13.249
Why? Cos you think I'd be shit?

26:13.250 --> 26:15.409
It's got nothing to do with that.

26:15.410 --> 26:17.609
Just another Frank?

26:17.610 --> 26:21.609
Your words, not mine.

26:21.850 --> 26:22.969
Does Ian know?

26:22.970 --> 26:26.969
No.

26:35.010 --> 26:39.009
We can have kids when
we've both grown up a bit.

26:40.010 --> 26:44.009
Yeah, right.

27:06.650 --> 27:09.729
All right?

27:09.730 --> 27:13.729
Where's your mother?

27:15.050 --> 27:17.929
She owes me money, remember.

27:17.930 --> 27:21.929
None of my business, remember?

27:22.130 --> 27:24.289
You won't find her in there. >

27:24.290 --> 27:27.889
This is my shop now.
I bought it.

27:27.890 --> 27:31.889
New lock.
Lack of stock. And barrel.

27:47.370 --> 27:51.369
Wondered how long it'd take you.

27:51.730 --> 27:55.729
With interest.

28:02.530 --> 28:03.809
Feeling better?

28:03.810 --> 28:05.969
What do you think?

28:05.970 --> 28:07.329
Listen it had nothing to do with me.

28:07.330 --> 28:09.969
Listen it had nothing to do with me.
Right. That's what I
thought when I got smashed in.

28:09.970 --> 28:12.569
I'm not sorry for something
I haven't done.

28:12.570 --> 28:13.089
Course not.

28:13.090 --> 28:16.769
Course not.
It's done. Over.

We should never've decorated.

Who had the right to just wipe
out all trace of her like that?

31:03.290 --> 31:06.169
I'm sure it wasn't intentional.

31:06.170 --> 31:10.169
It's not right, though. Is it?

31:11.690 --> 31:15.689
You miss her, don't you?

31:15.890 --> 31:19.889

We thought you were dead.

37:56.790 --> 37:59.269
Well, half cut, pal,
I'll give you that.

37:59.270 --> 38:03.269
But as God is my witness
I'm anything but dead.

38:05.230 --> 38:06.549
Apparently, they dedicated

38:06.550 --> 38:09.149
a waiting room to your name
when you were mown down.

38:09.150 --> 38:10.509
By a fire engine.

38:10.510 --> 38:12.869
Jumped in front of it, saving
the life of a six-year-old girl?

38:12.870 --> 38:16.869
She was thrown
fifty feet in the air? >

38:21.710 --> 38:22.709
I thought we were good together?

38:22.710 --> 38:25.109
We are.

38:25.110 --> 38:27.829
Listen, kid.
Telling porkies to dazzle the ladies

38:27.830 --> 38:29.989
might seem a good idea at the time

38:29.990 --> 38:32.909
but it's always going to come
back and bite you on the arse.

38:32.910 --> 38:34.469
Mark my words.

38:34.470 --> 38:35.749
Sorry.

38:35.750 --> 38:37.949
Keep your dignity, kid.

38:37.950 --> 38:39.869
You know, we all do it.

38:39.870 --> 38:42.549
Most lads your age would walk
over hot coal to get

38:42.550 --> 38:45.789
a bit of muff.

38:45.790 --> 38:48.029
What's a little white lie
between friends, eh, Mr...

38:48.030 --> 38:50.309
Come on, Holly.
I don't blame you for lying, lad.

38:50.310 --> 38:53.109
I'd've done the same
if he was my father.

38:53.110 --> 38:54.949
Hey, just hang on a minute, pal.

38:54.950 --> 38:58.949
I'm only trying to be polite. And I'm
a good father, for your information.

38:59.030 --> 39:00.469
Admittedly,
not the best in the world...

39:00.470 --> 39:02.709
I'm sorry. Can we just start again?

39:02.710 --> 39:04.109
And where would he fit in?

39:04.110 --> 39:04.829
And I love them.

39:04.830 --> 39:07.509
What if you ask me over for tea
and he's there?

39:07.510 --> 39:09.149
We have a laugh together.

39:09.150 --> 39:12.309
And I'm proud of what I've got.
Proud of each and every one of them.

39:12.310 --> 39:14.949
Will you just shut up?
Are you always this rude?

39:14.950 --> 39:18.949
Foul-mouthed? You're behaving like a
rancid, festering, smelly old tramp.

39:22.470 --> 39:25.069
Dad, can Liam
come in the car with us? >

39:25.070 --> 39:29.069
Please.

39:38.310 --> 39:41.389
Right, it's OK, Son. I understand.

39:41.390 --> 39:43.469
You know where I am if you need me.

39:43.470 --> 39:47.469
Maybe tramp was a bit harsh?

39:57.470 --> 39:58.509
Liam?

40:35.750 --> 40:37.229
Why don't we tell them the truth?

40:37.230 --> 40:37.909
And lose all trade?

40:37.910 --> 40:40.029
Not good for business being cuckoo.

40:40.030 --> 40:44.029
Karen's the reason most blokes come
in here I think they'll find it

40:44.270 --> 40:46.869
in their hearts to forgive her
for a few week's absence?

40:46.870 --> 40:48.989
No-one wants a screaming
banshee pulling pints, though.

40:48.990 --> 40:50.469
She's ill. Why can't you say that?

40:50.470 --> 40:51.549
People aren't stupid.

40:51.550 --> 40:53.629
Oh, really? Is that a fact?

40:53.630 --> 40:55.629
We could say
she's on remand for assault?

40:55.630 --> 40:57.069
A family tiff?

40:57.070 --> 41:01.069
She knocked seven shades of
shite out of one of you two lads?

41:01.430 --> 41:01.789
Yeah...

41:01.790 --> 41:05.789
I like it... Assault it is then.

41:09.990 --> 41:11.229
Dad?

41:11.230 --> 41:12.669
What?

41:12.670 --> 41:16.669
Could you sub us a one, er? I'm late
on my rent and Ian's being a cunt.

41:17.030 --> 41:21.029
As he should be if you're late.

41:29.150 --> 41:31.429
MOBILE PHONE

41:31.430 --> 41:35.429
Hello?

41:36.470 --> 41:40.309
'Hello?'

41:40.310 --> 41:44.309
Pleasure doing business with you.

41:53.190 --> 41:57.189
I take that as a no then.

42:03.230 --> 42:04.869
Shit.

42:04.870 --> 42:08.869
Fuck!

42:13.750 --> 42:15.749
Promise you'll call me every day.

42:15.750 --> 42:19.749
Course I will.

42:23.590 --> 42:27.589
I love you, Son.

42:27.590 --> 42:30.589
Go on.

42:30.590 --> 42:32.629
What kind of mother leaves her son?

42:32.630 --> 42:36.349
A good one. You've done a brilliant
job. He's a good lad. He'll be fine.

42:36.350 --> 42:40.349
Thanks.

42:40.470 --> 42:42.349
(Keep her safe or you're dead meat.)

42:42.350 --> 42:43.909
Course I will.

42:43.910 --> 42:45.589
And you stick with Joe.

42:45.590 --> 42:48.149
He'll look after you.

42:48.150 --> 42:49.309
I can look after myself.

42:49.310 --> 42:53.309
You know what I mean. Be careful.

43:26.550 --> 43:30.189
She asked me to.Why?

43:30.190 --> 43:32.749
She said
she doesn't want any more hassle.

43:32.750 --> 43:33.949
There is no hassle.

43:33.950 --> 43:35.109
I'm only helping out.

43:35.110 --> 43:36.989
I could've done it.

43:36.990 --> 43:40.189
get some space for a few days?

43:40.190 --> 43:42.789
Is that what she said?

43:42.790 --> 43:46.789
We need space? That's right up there
with "it's not you it's me". You'll

43:47.510 --> 43:50.509
be telling me she doesn't deserve
me next. I knew you'd take her side.

43:50.510 --> 43:52.549
I'm not taking sides!

43:55.590 --> 43:59.389
Has she told you everything?

43:59.390 --> 44:02.069
I said what's between you
two is none of my business.

44:02.070 --> 44:03.789
But she.Carl, no.

44:16.910 --> 44:18.909
What's happened now?Pipes.

44:18.910 --> 44:19.749
Again? >

44:19.750 --> 44:22.229
Yeah I'd better give Dan a call.

44:22.230 --> 44:23.309
What's up?

44:23.310 --> 44:25.149
System must be fucked.

44:25.150 --> 44:29.149
We need the whole thing re-doing.
Everything just keeps leaking. >

44:30.790 --> 44:32.669
That's nowt, that.

44:32.670 --> 44:35.549
the trap, that's all.

44:35.550 --> 44:38.589
Someone's been pissing
about with this, haven't they?

44:38.590 --> 44:42.229
What?

44:42.230 --> 44:44.469
Helpless female
course at sixth form.

44:44.470 --> 44:48.469
Just leave it to me.

44:49.310 --> 44:53.309
Nice one.

44:54.510 --> 44:57.069
'Early lesson in being
married to a Jackson.

44:57.070 --> 45:01.069
'Not sometimes but every time

45:58.950 --> 46:00.869

Where the shit am I?

46:02.830 --> 46:05.429
Just point me home, will ya?

46:05.430 --> 46:07.709
This isours. I like what we have.

46:07.710 --> 46:09.109
You're always pleasing me.

46:09.110 --> 46:11.789
Need to liven things up with
a game of pull a pig.

46:11.790 --> 46:14.549
I can't believe I promised him
he'd get laid tonight.

46:14.550 --> 46:15.789
I think we both want
the same thing don't we?

46:15.790 --> 46:18.029
It has been a long time.

46:18.030 --> 46:19.429
Shane made me a promise tonight.

46:19.430 --> 46:21.189
Wash your cock
in the sink and throw on a condom.

46:21.190 --> 46:23.029
Smell my finger.What's that?

46:23.030 --> 46:27.029
Your mum.
