TV ANNOUNCER:
We now return to Jeremy Piven

00:37.471 --> 00:39.338
as   <i>The Incredible Hulk.</i>

00:39.340 --> 00:41.173
You wouldn't like me
when I'm angry.

00:41.175 --> 00:42.875
I don't like you now.

00:42.877 --> 00:44.710
Brian, I need the TV.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.145
Why is Rupert
wearing a top hat?

00:46.147 --> 00:48.347
Because, Brian,
tonight we sup on

00:48.349 --> 00:50.049
the finest feast of
the television season.

00:50.051 --> 00:51.650
It is the
season finale

00:51.652 --> 00:53.252
of <i>The Cadwalliders</i>
<i>of Essex.</i>

00:53.254 --> 00:55.421
The what?
<i>The Cadwalliders</i>
<i>of Essex.</i>

00:55.423 --> 00:56.822
It's groundbreaking.

00:56.824 --> 00:58.690
It's a British show
about a wealthy family

00:58.692 --> 01:00.025
dealing with
slight change.

01:00.027 --> 01:01.493
Oh, I thought
that got cancelled.

01:01.495 --> 01:03.328
No, that was <i>The Caduggans</i>
<i>of Aubrey Muse.</i>

01:03.330 --> 01:05.397
Is that the one where even
the children have muttonchops?

01:05.399 --> 01:07.399
No, that's <i>The Whittakers</i>
<i>of Edgerton Crescent.</i>

01:07.401 --> 01:08.834
All these shows
sound the same.

01:08.836 --> 01:09.902
Who's in this one?

01:09.904 --> 01:11.036
Penelope
Westworth-Harrington.

01:11.038 --> 01:12.371
Who's that?

01:12.373 --> 01:14.540
Penelope Westworth-Harrington?
Oh, come on!

01:14.542 --> 01:16.341
From <i>The Roysters of</i>
<i>Pumbridge on Thames?</i>

01:16.343 --> 01:18.544
Her uncle was steward
to the Queen's Privy!

01:18.546 --> 01:20.112
(sighs)

01:20.114 --> 01:22.414
She got plowed on a pile
of hay in <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

01:22.416 --> 01:23.916
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:23.918 --> 01:24.883
She's hot.

01:24.885 --> 01:26.351
Ugh, you're an idiot.

01:26.353 --> 01:28.087
Like a guy who cheats
on his right hand

01:28.089 --> 01:29.588
with his left hand.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.023
I want to stay,

01:31.025 --> 01:33.058
but I just got called
back into the office.

01:33.060 --> 01:34.560
What do you want from me?

01:34.562 --> 01:35.627
I'm sorry, all right?

01:35.629 --> 01:37.029
Just get off my back!

01:37.031 --> 01:38.764
I'm out of here.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.134
God, it took me forever
to get awa...

01:42.136 --> 01:43.202
(gunshot)

01:43.204 --> 01:44.203
Oh, my God!

01:44.205 --> 01:45.404
No!

01:45.406 --> 01:47.539
What have you done?!

01:47.541 --> 01:48.707
Wait! Stop!

01:48.709 --> 01:49.808
No, please!

01:49.810 --> 01:50.776
I'm begging you!

01:50.778 --> 01:52.778
(gunshot)

01:55.081 --> 01:57.282
(sobbing)

02:02.489 --> 02:03.622
(classical music playing
over TV)

02:03.624 --> 02:04.957
Oh, it's starting!

02:04.959 --> 02:06.492
I'm gonna live-tweet the show

02:06.494 --> 02:08.961
and ruin it for everyone
in other time zones.

02:13.299 --> 02:17.236
I would like to learn
to bathe myself.

02:20.306 --> 02:23.275
Everything I've ever
heard is vexing.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.776
Oh! Oh!

02:24.778 --> 02:26.812
This is the fastest-moving
episode I've ever seen!

02:26.814 --> 02:28.013
Wouldn't it be marvelous

02:28.015 --> 02:30.115
to be a part of
a family like that?

02:30.117 --> 02:31.950
Ah-ha, I found
that chick in the hay.

02:31.952 --> 02:33.919
PETER and CHRIS (chanting):
Unga bunga, unga bunga,

02:33.921 --> 02:35.120
unga bunga.

02:35.122 --> 02:36.922
What is that?
What's happening?

02:36.924 --> 02:40.125
Unga bunga, unga bunga,
unga bunga.

02:40.127 --> 02:41.160
Peter, what are you doing?

02:41.162 --> 02:42.327
Playing Unga Bunga.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.328
It's the championship.

02:43.330 --> 02:44.796
Go away!

02:44.798 --> 02:46.999
This is why Zillow estimates
our house at $4.00.

02:47.001 --> 02:48.433
What the hell is Unga Bunga?

02:48.435 --> 02:49.768
Two guys run
at each other

02:49.770 --> 02:52.004
with mattresses,
and, um...

02:52.006 --> 02:53.372
th-that's kind of it.

02:53.374 --> 02:55.607
Stop explaining it to the dog!

02:55.609 --> 02:57.009
Let's do this!

02:57.011 --> 02:59.444
(yelling wildly)

02:59.446 --> 03:01.280
Stop it!
I'm trying to watch my program!

03:01.282 --> 03:02.948
Whoa, Chris, look!
Mom's naked!

03:02.950 --> 03:04.016
Where?

03:04.018 --> 03:05.250
You creep.

03:06.886 --> 03:08.620
(gasps)
No!

03:08.622 --> 03:10.556
Peter, what's going on in...

03:10.558 --> 03:11.790
Unga Bunga!
(crashing)

03:11.792 --> 03:14.026
You... you imbeciles!

03:14.028 --> 03:15.294
You ruined my night!

03:15.296 --> 03:16.995
I ask for one thing
in this house!

03:16.997 --> 03:19.031
Stewie, just watch
your show upstairs.

03:19.033 --> 03:21.533
I don't want to watch it
upstairs on the small TV!

03:21.535 --> 03:24.336
I want to watch it
downstairs on the big TV!

03:24.338 --> 03:25.370
(sniffling)

03:25.372 --> 03:27.506
I want to watch my show!

03:27.508 --> 03:29.741
(crying, screaming)

03:31.744 --> 03:33.879
Oh, no, Stewie's
having a tantrum.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.614
Come here, sweetie.

03:37.584 --> 03:38.650
Ow!

03:38.652 --> 03:40.185
Screw you, you little turd!

03:40.187 --> 03:41.720
(crying)

03:42.555 --> 03:44.323
What's all that noise?

03:44.325 --> 03:47.559
Aw, do you want a hug
from your big sister?

03:48.661 --> 03:50.128
Ow!

03:52.098 --> 03:55.100
You've earned yourself
a time-out, young man.

03:55.102 --> 03:57.936
Now, you stay in here
until you can behave.

03:57.938 --> 04:00.172
I hate you!
You always ruin everything!

04:00.174 --> 04:02.074
God, it's a family of idiots!

04:02.076 --> 04:03.275
I wish...

04:03.277 --> 04:05.477
I wish I was never born!

04:06.346 --> 04:07.879
Not tonight, Rupert.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.748
I'm much too upset.

04:13.786 --> 04:15.187
Knock, knock.

04:15.189 --> 04:16.188
Stewie?

04:16.190 --> 04:17.856
Hey, I just
wanted to check

04:17.858 --> 04:19.024
on how you're
doing, buddy.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.626
You put on quite
a show last night.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.127
I am done with this family.

04:22.129 --> 04:23.795
They don't deserve me.
They're all just...

04:23.797 --> 04:25.097
Oh, you dick,
you just came in

04:25.099 --> 04:26.298
to charge your phone.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.500
Sorry, Peter's using
all the outlets.

04:29.902 --> 04:31.536
Toast house.

04:31.538 --> 04:34.139
Whatever. I'm gonna be
out of this place soon anyway.

04:34.141 --> 04:35.607
What, are you
running away from home?

04:35.609 --> 04:36.808
Better.

04:39.579 --> 04:40.812
What the hell?

04:40.814 --> 04:42.981
You rebuilt
your time machine?

04:42.983 --> 04:45.217
I thought you
swore off time travel,

04:45.219 --> 04:47.085
'cause you couldn't stop
yourself from altering the past.

04:47.087 --> 04:48.420
Look, Brian,
I need this machine

04:48.422 --> 04:50.122
to alter the past
for the better.

04:50.124 --> 04:51.089
What do you mean?

04:51.091 --> 04:52.824
I loathe this family.

04:52.826 --> 04:55.794
Being born into it was clearly
some sort of cosmic mistake,

04:55.796 --> 04:58.397
so I'm going back in time
to prevent that mistake.

04:58.399 --> 05:00.766
I'm going to break up Lois
and the fat man

05:00.768 --> 05:02.501
before they can conceive me.

05:02.503 --> 05:04.069
Stewie, it's one TV show.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.304
You're overreacting.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.139
It's not just the
TV show, Brian.

05:07.141 --> 05:09.007
I'm tired of
living with morons.

05:09.009 --> 05:12.010
Remember when I tried to open
that lemonade stand with Chris?

05:12.012 --> 05:13.645
All right,
that'll be ten cents.

05:13.647 --> 05:14.946
Chris, pour the man
his lemonade.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.181
CHRIS:
I can't!

05:16.183 --> 05:18.917
The lemonade tricked me
and got away!

05:18.919 --> 05:21.820
Lemons are God's children!

05:21.822 --> 05:23.622
And the fat man
won't even let me

05:23.624 --> 05:25.457
celebrate a
proper birthday.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.426
Happy birthday, Stewie!

05:27.428 --> 05:30.028
And here's your
equal-attention cake, Peter.

05:30.030 --> 05:31.496
Yay!

05:32.165 --> 05:33.131
Oh, come on!

05:33.133 --> 05:34.866
Yay! Double wishes!

05:36.302 --> 05:37.502
One...

05:41.441 --> 05:42.641
...two.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.710
And Meg's the
biggest pig of all.

05:44.712 --> 05:45.844
MEG:
Great.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.013
The string broke again.

05:48.015 --> 05:51.283
Hey, there, tiny hands.

05:51.285 --> 05:53.285
Look, Stewie, I know
you're angry about last night,

05:53.287 --> 05:55.354
but you're talking about
erasing your existence.

05:55.356 --> 05:56.455
That's crazy.

05:56.457 --> 05:59.191
("Barracuda" ringtone plays)

05:59.193 --> 06:01.860
Whose ringtone
is "Barracuda"?

06:01.862 --> 06:04.129
Oh, God,
that's Frumpy Ann.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.497
Frumpy Ann
does everything.

06:05.499 --> 06:07.132
Look, I-I got to
get this call,

06:07.134 --> 06:09.134
but don't do
anything stupid.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.069
Yo, girl,
how you livin'?

06:11.071 --> 06:12.637
Ugh.

06:14.540 --> 06:17.509
All right, Rupert,
prepare to time travel.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.711
Oh, and by the way,
thanks for asking me

06:19.713 --> 06:22.381
if I wanted something
from Subway, too.

06:41.434 --> 06:42.868
Where am I?

06:42.870 --> 06:45.437
This looks like my room,
but something's off.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.372
Oh, that's right,
this isn't my room yet.

06:47.374 --> 06:49.408
Wonder what
they're using it for.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.246
Oh, my God, he had
a public access show?

06:54.248 --> 06:56.581
Live from the shores
of Rhode Island,

06:56.583 --> 06:58.850
it's the fatty
who drives you batty!

06:58.852 --> 07:00.619
Peter Griffin!

07:00.621 --> 07:03.088
(applause)

07:04.257 --> 07:05.791
Hey, hey, hey, douche bags!

07:05.793 --> 07:07.559
We got a great show
for you tonight.

07:07.561 --> 07:09.594
Karen Washington from
the Rhode Island Zoo

07:09.596 --> 07:12.130
and some rejected toys
you're not gonna believe.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.032
So stick around, or...

07:14.034 --> 07:17.402
STUDIO AUDIENCE:
I'll come to your house
and murder you!

07:17.404 --> 07:19.938
I wonder what else is different.

07:21.240 --> 07:23.141
♪ Lucky there's a man who

07:23.143 --> 07:24.743
♪ Positively can do

07:24.745 --> 07:26.378
♪ All the things that make us

07:26.380 --> 07:28.447
♪ La la la...

07:28.449 --> 07:32.017
She is camel toe-ing
the hell out of that leotard.

07:39.492 --> 07:42.561
All right, Rupert, time to
break up Lois and the fat man

07:42.563 --> 07:45.397
before they can conceive me
by pressing butts together.

07:45.399 --> 07:47.365
Well, you don't know, either!

07:48.634 --> 07:51.570
Hey, Lois, I drawed
you a picture.

07:53.172 --> 07:55.307
It's me and you
on the space moon,

07:55.309 --> 07:57.843
'cause I would
love you anywhere.

07:57.845 --> 08:01.046
Oh, Peter.
I'd love you anywhere, too.

08:02.281 --> 08:05.083
Wow, Peter and Lois
were really in love

08:05.085 --> 08:06.485
before I was born.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.820
And this is me getting
you from behind,

08:08.822 --> 08:11.289
'cause in space no one
can hear you scream.

08:11.291 --> 08:13.358
(laughs):
Oh, Peter!

08:13.360 --> 08:16.461
Breaking them up may prove to be
more difficult than I thought.

08:16.463 --> 08:18.597
Though I've faced
bigger challenges before.

08:18.599 --> 08:21.299
Like when I had to ride
that bike in <i>The Muppet Movie.</i>

08:21.301 --> 08:23.168
(folksy music plays)

08:23.170 --> 08:24.436
That's right.

08:24.438 --> 08:26.505
Stewie Long Legs
just blew your mind.

08:29.308 --> 08:31.877
All right, Rupert,
now to break up my parents.

08:31.879 --> 08:34.513
The number one thing
couples fight about is money.

08:34.515 --> 08:36.882
So I've maxed out
Lois's credit card

08:36.884 --> 08:39.117
on vibrating marital aids.

08:41.721 --> 08:43.889
Peter, there's an open box
in the kitchen

08:43.891 --> 08:45.857
addressed to me
with nothing inside.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.293
(vibrating): Uh, yeah, when I
opened it up, it was empty.

08:48.295 --> 08:49.895
Well, that's
very strange,

08:49.897 --> 08:52.497
because it looked large
enough to hold many items.

08:52.499 --> 08:53.565
(doorbell rings)

08:53.567 --> 08:54.833
(vibrating):
It's the mailman!

08:54.835 --> 08:55.734
I'll get it!

08:55.736 --> 08:57.402
No! Me!
I'll get it!

08:57.404 --> 08:59.304
(vibrating):
Huh. Maybe I had more in common

08:59.306 --> 09:01.373
with this family than I thought.

09:13.019 --> 09:14.185
Oh, my God, Peter!

09:14.187 --> 09:15.687
What happened
to your hair?

09:15.689 --> 09:16.888
I don't know. I...

09:16.890 --> 09:18.256
I'm bald!

09:18.258 --> 09:19.491
You did this!

09:19.493 --> 09:21.026
What the hell's
the matter with you?!

09:21.028 --> 09:23.695
I didn't do it, but...
but you look really cool.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.196
I do?

09:25.198 --> 09:28.233
Yeah, you look like you
could be a celebrity.

09:29.101 --> 09:30.902
Hey, can I get
your autograph?

09:30.904 --> 09:33.238
Oh, of course,
here you go.

09:34.507 --> 09:36.274
They think
I'm Bruce Willis.

09:36.276 --> 09:39.177
That was the monster
from <i>Goonies!</i>

09:43.282 --> 09:45.016
None of my attempts
to break them up

09:45.018 --> 09:47.886
has worked thus far,
so I had to up our game.

09:47.888 --> 09:50.121
Lois, what the hell did you do?!

09:50.123 --> 09:51.590
I just got a note from Goodwill

09:51.592 --> 09:53.525
thanking me for
donating all my porn.

09:53.527 --> 09:54.726
What?!

09:54.728 --> 09:56.261
I'm sick and tired
of you blaming me

09:56.263 --> 09:57.562
for things I didn't do!

09:57.564 --> 09:59.564
And I've got a bone
to pick with you!

09:59.566 --> 10:01.466
I don't appreciate
how you spray-painted

10:01.468 --> 10:03.301
"vile woman"
on the bedroom wall.

10:03.303 --> 10:04.369
That wasn't me!

10:04.371 --> 10:05.770
Must've been
one of the kids!

10:05.772 --> 10:07.238
That's ridiculous,
Peter!

10:07.240 --> 10:08.540
Chris can't write,

10:08.542 --> 10:10.709
and we don't allow
Meg upstairs!

10:12.144 --> 10:13.878
Well, you know something,
I'm starting to think

10:13.880 --> 10:15.313
whoever wrote
that is right!

10:15.315 --> 10:17.215
Well, maybe I don't want
to live with someone

10:17.217 --> 10:18.416
who doesn't respect me!

10:18.418 --> 10:20.218
Well, then maybe
I should just leave!

10:20.220 --> 10:21.653
And where are you gonna go?

10:21.655 --> 10:24.055
You got nothing else
and nobody else!

10:24.057 --> 10:25.957
And now for the closer.

10:27.426 --> 10:28.960
(honks)

10:29.996 --> 10:32.197
I might go west.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.901
My God, I've done it, Rupert!

10:36.903 --> 10:38.136
They've broken up!

10:38.138 --> 10:39.904
(gasps) Look!

10:39.906 --> 10:40.972
It's working.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.574
I'm fading away!

10:42.576 --> 10:45.243
Well, Rupert, this means
you and I will never have met.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.479
So I've got
to tell you one thing:

10:47.481 --> 10:50.015
you know that song I wrote you
for Valentine's Day?

10:50.017 --> 10:51.950
It's an Eric Carmen song.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.485
I completely ripped it off.

10:53.487 --> 10:55.720
Ah. Ah, now I feel better.

10:58.924 --> 11:00.158
(Stewie groans)

11:00.160 --> 11:01.626
STEWIE:
<i>Wha...</i>

11:01.628 --> 11:03.094
<i>What the devil?</i>

11:03.096 --> 11:04.095
<i>What's going on?</i>

11:04.097 --> 11:05.530
<i>Where am I?</i>

11:05.532 --> 11:06.865
DOCTOR:
It's a boy!

11:06.867 --> 11:09.167
STEWIE:
<i>I'm in a hospital.</i>

11:09.169 --> 11:11.369
<i>My soul must have</i>
<i>found another carrier.</i>

11:11.371 --> 11:13.204
<i>I've been reborn!</i>

11:13.206 --> 11:15.607
(British accent):
Welcome to the world, baby chap.

11:15.609 --> 11:16.541
(gasps)

11:16.543 --> 11:17.776
I'm British?

11:17.778 --> 11:19.044
All right!

11:19.046 --> 11:20.712
Ooh, I wonder if
I'll have one of those

11:20.714 --> 11:23.915
pug-nosed British dogs
that licks its own snot all day.

11:25.985 --> 11:27.452
Ew, that's gross.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.454
(Cockney accent):
Piss off, you little wanker.

11:29.456 --> 11:32.223
I'm not gonna be the dog
to some poof baby.

11:45.504 --> 11:48.139
Well, lad,
welcome to your home.

11:50.976 --> 11:53.411
Well, this is more like it.

11:53.413 --> 11:55.880
This is your valet,
your gardener,

11:55.882 --> 11:58.750
your cook, your gamekeeper,
your butler, your housekeeper,

11:58.752 --> 12:00.218
your parlor maid,
your housemaid,

12:00.220 --> 12:02.754
your scullery maid,
your shoe de-graveler

12:02.756 --> 12:04.422
and one superfluous employee

12:04.424 --> 12:06.558
who I am not in a gay
relationship with.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.727
Sir, we have a meeting
in the broom shed.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.095
Quite right.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.596
I will now hand you
over to your mother.

12:11.598 --> 12:13.498
This will be our
last physical contact

12:13.500 --> 12:15.400
until I give you
a firm handshake

12:15.402 --> 12:17.669
on your 18th birthday.

12:20.106 --> 12:22.907
My God, this is everything
I've ever wanted.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.677
And let's be honest, if I had
stayed with the Griffins,

12:25.679 --> 12:28.246
I would have ended up like
Rick Springfield today.

12:28.248 --> 12:32.217
♪ I wish that
I had Jesse's job. ♪

12:32.219 --> 12:33.852
(sighs)

12:37.723 --> 12:39.424
Sir, it's 6:00 p.m.

12:39.426 --> 12:43.027
and you're still in
your 5:45 tuxedo.

12:43.029 --> 12:45.363
Nigel, yesterday
I saw you smile.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.966
Is that something I need
to bring up with my father?

12:47.968 --> 12:51.069
I was just imagining
my own death, sir.

12:51.071 --> 12:52.370
You're a good man, Nigel.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.038
May I pull on
your nose hair?

12:54.040 --> 12:55.740
Of course, sir.

12:55.742 --> 12:57.976
(laughing)

13:05.050 --> 13:07.552
My heavens, my father
is the Commander

13:07.554 --> 13:09.587
of the Most Excellent Order
of the British Empire,

13:09.589 --> 13:11.556
Dean of Physics at Oxford,

13:11.558 --> 13:14.492
and he was pre-approved for
a Capital One No-Hassle Card.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.761
Oh, okay, so he's just
framing everything.

13:16.763 --> 13:20.131
Stewart, these are
your brothers, Jaden and Aidan.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.467
Jaden was first form
in his sixth levels

13:22.469 --> 13:25.436
and he's chief scrum-flanker
on his varsity boogling team,

13:25.438 --> 13:27.972
which, as far as we know,
makes us terribly proud.

13:27.974 --> 13:30.508
Finally, siblings
who are doing stuff.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.610
I'm really happy
to meet you guys.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.312
You were an accident.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.514
You're only here because
Father is a heavy sleeper

13:36.516 --> 13:38.516
with a frequent
morning stem.

13:38.518 --> 13:41.319
Okay. Aidan's the ball-breaker,
huh, Jaden?

13:41.321 --> 13:45.256
Father, is "it" going
to live here for a while?

13:45.258 --> 13:47.025
Oh, Aidan is the nice one.

13:47.027 --> 13:49.694
Well, if it's verbal jousting
skills you're looking for,

13:49.696 --> 13:53.932
I'm not afraid to take a little
walk on the Oscar Wilde side.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.967
You are a poopy head.

13:55.969 --> 13:58.102
And you... shut up.

13:58.104 --> 14:00.171
Stewart, I think
your mouth is better

14:00.173 --> 14:02.807
at taking things in
than spewing them out.

14:02.809 --> 14:04.943
(both laughing)

14:04.945 --> 14:08.012
Wow, these guys are a little
sharper than my old family.

14:08.014 --> 14:11.182
I still remember
our Duck Duck Goose disaster.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.350
Duck.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.351
Duck.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.352
Duck.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.354
Duck.

14:16.356 --> 14:19.457
Duck. Duck.

14:19.459 --> 14:20.725
Duck.

14:20.727 --> 14:22.360
Duck. Duck.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.561
Duck.

14:25.664 --> 14:26.865
Duck.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.800
Duck. Duck.

14:28.802 --> 14:30.068
Duck.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.070
Duck.

14:36.642 --> 14:38.476
Duck.

14:38.478 --> 14:41.212
<i>What is that other word?</i>

14:44.016 --> 14:45.516
(Stewie suckling)

14:45.518 --> 14:47.352
(Cockney accent):
There we are.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.821
Sorry I couldn't squeeze
no more juice outta me nippers.

14:49.823 --> 14:51.556
Oh, that's all right.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.259
I can't be mad at someone who
lost seven sons in the war.

14:54.261 --> 14:57.061
All right, my little lord,
it's time for bed.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.830
Why isn't Mommy
tucking me in?

14:58.832 --> 15:00.865
Oh, hush, love,
you're born now.

15:00.867 --> 15:03.601
That's the end of all
this "Mommy" nonsense.

15:06.438 --> 15:08.673
(howling)

15:11.176 --> 15:12.443
What the hell?

15:12.445 --> 15:14.512
I don't even get
a stuffed animal to hug?

15:14.514 --> 15:15.914
The only thing in this crib

15:15.916 --> 15:17.615
is a 19th-century
dueling pistol.

15:17.617 --> 15:18.616
(screams)

15:18.618 --> 15:20.418
It's loaded?!

15:20.420 --> 15:22.887
BRITISH NOBLEMAN: Who dares to
shoot the bow tie off my cat?

15:22.889 --> 15:24.188
We duel at dawn!

15:24.190 --> 15:25.523
I'm just a baby!

15:25.525 --> 15:26.724
So am I!

15:26.726 --> 15:28.726
Good Lord, what have I done?

15:28.728 --> 15:30.561
I don't like it here at all!

15:30.563 --> 15:31.863
I miss my family!

15:31.865 --> 15:34.032
My dumb family!

15:34.034 --> 15:35.433
Dear God.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.568
I wanted to be free
of the family of morons

15:37.570 --> 15:41.039
I was born into,
but now I'm the moron!

15:41.041 --> 15:42.573
Sir, I heard
whimpering.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.642
Shall I fetch
your crying tuxedo?

15:44.644 --> 15:47.045
No! I don't want
any more tuxedos!

15:47.047 --> 15:48.947
And I don't want a cold mother

15:48.949 --> 15:50.748
or an Oxford physics
professor father.

15:50.750 --> 15:51.716
(gasps)

15:51.718 --> 15:53.084
Wait a minute! That's it!

15:53.086 --> 15:54.819
The Oxford physics lab will have

15:54.821 --> 15:56.788
everything I need
to build a time machine.

15:56.790 --> 15:59.123
Then I can go
back to my old life!

16:00.826 --> 16:02.727
Ah, ah!
Stone floor, too cold.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.896
I'll go in the morning.

16:11.236 --> 16:14.238
Let's see, I need plutonium
for the time machine.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.274
But how do I get
past those guards?

16:16.276 --> 16:18.476
Oh, wait, that's right.
I'm in England.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.245
I can just walk past them
holding a cup of tea.

16:21.247 --> 16:22.747
Morning.
Morning.

16:22.749 --> 16:24.415
Morning.
Morning.

16:27.686 --> 16:28.820
Morning.
Morning.

16:28.822 --> 16:30.621
Morning.
Morning.

16:30.623 --> 16:34.025
Did you see something
suspicious about that baby?

16:34.027 --> 16:35.760
Well, I did at first,

16:35.762 --> 16:38.496
but then he's got the tea
vouching for him, doesn't he?

16:51.443 --> 16:52.677
Almost there.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.045
Just a few more adjustments.

16:54.047 --> 16:55.480
BRITISH FATHER:
Stewart!
(gasps)

16:55.482 --> 16:57.181
What are you doing?

17:04.523 --> 17:06.391
All right, Rupert,
I left the fat man's

17:06.393 --> 17:07.792
entire porn collection

17:07.794 --> 17:09.894
on the curb
for Goodwill to pick up.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.865
(screams)

17:17.870 --> 17:19.904
(gasps)
Who the devil are you?

17:19.906 --> 17:21.072
I'm British Stewie.

17:21.074 --> 17:22.640
I don't hear
anything different.

17:22.642 --> 17:23.875
I sound the same,

17:23.877 --> 17:25.243
but I spell some words
very differently.

17:25.245 --> 17:26.511
Let me write
the word "color"

17:26.513 --> 17:28.212
on a piece of
paper for you.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.480
(gasps)

17:29.482 --> 17:31.182
Dear God! You <i>are</i> British!

17:31.184 --> 17:32.550
Listen to me.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.218
You successfully prevented
your own birth,

17:34.220 --> 17:36.487
and instead you were born
into an alternate family.

17:36.489 --> 17:37.755
But you must believe me,

17:37.757 --> 17:40.024
the Griffins are
your true destiny.

17:40.026 --> 17:41.826
No, they're not. They're morons.

17:41.828 --> 17:44.695
But they're your morons,
and they care about you.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.731
Besides, you shine
among these dullards.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.599
Like Bob Weir in
The Grateful Dead.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.835
That joke's for
one of our crew guys, Matty.

17:50.837 --> 17:53.738
He loves The Dead and he's,
uh... he's not doing so well.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.174
We love ya, Captain Trips.
Hang in, bro.

17:56.176 --> 17:59.577
Well, I do like being
better than everyone else.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.446
LOIS: Peter, I had
nothing to do

18:01.448 --> 18:03.047
with donating
your stupid porn!

18:03.049 --> 18:05.016
If what you're
telling me is true,

18:05.018 --> 18:06.517
we can't let
them separate.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.286
If Peter leaves,
I'll be unborn!

18:08.288 --> 18:09.520
Well, she's not
gonna stop him.

18:09.522 --> 18:10.788
She's furious.
(gasps)

18:10.790 --> 18:12.457
You're right!
And if I know her,

18:12.459 --> 18:13.858
she'll be heading
to the fridge

18:13.860 --> 18:15.860
for her angry
afternoon Chardonnay.

18:15.862 --> 18:17.462
I've got an idea!

18:22.034 --> 18:23.901
Okay, there it is.

18:23.903 --> 18:25.603
Noon.

18:36.882 --> 18:38.749
Oh, no! He's leaving!

18:38.751 --> 18:41.285
I'm... I'm fading away!

18:41.287 --> 18:42.553
Peter, wait!

18:42.555 --> 18:44.555
What? You want to yell
at me some more?

18:44.557 --> 18:47.058
No, I want to
tell you I'm sorry.

18:47.060 --> 18:48.993
I... I don't want
you to leave.

18:48.995 --> 18:51.262
Why should I stay if
you don't even trust me?

18:51.264 --> 18:53.297
I do trust you, Peter.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.566
I don't know what's
gotten into us lately.

18:55.568 --> 18:58.769
The important thing is,
we're meant to be together.

18:58.771 --> 19:01.072
I love you, Peter.

19:01.074 --> 19:04.408
Aw, I love you, too, Lois.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.314
I'm glad we're
staying together.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.650
Honestly, I-I don't know
what I would do on my own.

19:12.652 --> 19:16.087
Like, I literally have no
idea where food comes from.

19:16.089 --> 19:17.488
I-Is it that guy?

19:17.490 --> 19:19.490
Is he the food man?

19:22.861 --> 19:25.196
No, Peter, it's not him.

19:25.198 --> 19:26.364
They're making up!

19:26.366 --> 19:27.532
It's working!

19:27.534 --> 19:29.467
That means soon
you will not exist.

19:29.469 --> 19:32.870
Then I guess this
is good-bye, Stewie.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.105
I'll miss you.

19:34.107 --> 19:35.439
You've taught
me so much.

19:35.441 --> 19:36.841
And you've been
a good friend.

19:36.843 --> 19:37.975
And you as well.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.110
Ah! Damn it!

19:39.112 --> 19:40.545
Help me, Stewie!
Lift it off!

19:40.547 --> 19:42.280
Eh, that looks
really heavy.

19:42.282 --> 19:44.348
It is! And it's
incredibly painful!

19:44.350 --> 19:45.483
Please, help!

19:45.485 --> 19:46.817
You know,
you'll be fading away

19:46.819 --> 19:48.452
any moment, you know?

19:48.454 --> 19:50.488
It'd be a lot of effort
ultimately for nothing.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.023
I'm choking on
my own blood!

19:52.025 --> 19:53.024
(gurgles)

19:53.026 --> 19:54.959
Call someone! Please!

19:54.961 --> 19:57.828
Well, again,
it was great knowing you.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.363
Ah! You bastard!

19:59.365 --> 20:01.065
You'll burn in hell...

20:02.367 --> 20:03.734
Ugh, finally.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.403
That was an ordeal.

20:12.644 --> 20:14.178
I... I did it!

20:14.180 --> 20:15.580
I'm back.

20:15.582 --> 20:16.747
Aw, damn it.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.883
I left my ChapStick in the past.

20:20.152 --> 20:21.519
ChapStick!

20:21.521 --> 20:23.754
With smooth lips,
I will finally be able

20:23.756 --> 20:26.924
to be a mayor who kisses babies
with confidence!

20:26.926 --> 20:28.893
Hey, cracked lips!

20:28.895 --> 20:29.927
You'll see!

20:29.929 --> 20:31.929
You'll all see!

20:37.369 --> 20:39.904
Ooh, scrambled eggs!
How delightful.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.172
Thank you, Lois.

20:41.174 --> 20:42.607
Well, you're certainly
in a better mood

20:42.609 --> 20:44.242
since last
night's tantrum.

20:44.244 --> 20:47.078
You know, Brian, I've realized
this is where I belong.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.747
For better or worse,
I'm a Griffin.

20:49.749 --> 20:50.881
(door crashes)

20:50.883 --> 20:53.384
Coward!
I have found you!

20:53.386 --> 20:54.619
Ah!

20:54.621 --> 20:57.021
Well, it took
three years,

20:57.023 --> 21:00.424
but I am finally
through all that porn.
