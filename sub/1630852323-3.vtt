<i>"She's getting her broker license</i>

10:31.631 --> 10:32.465
<i>[sighs]</i>

10:33.257 --> 10:37.637
<i>I mean, this kind of leads me</i>
<i>to stuff that I… I felt some kind of way,</i>

10:38.387 --> 10:42.183
<i>when you're implementing new</i>
<i>commission splits that I don't agree with.</i>

10:43.851 --> 10:47.188
<i>And I was excluded</i>
<i>from some of the marketing materials,</i>

10:47.271 --> 10:52.026
<i>so I do think it's important for me</i>
<i>to have options when I don't agree with…</i>

10:52.109 --> 10:54.862
<i>I don't always</i>
<i>agree with some of the policy changes.</i>

10:54.945 --> 10:57.281
<i>If you're not happy here,</i>

10:59.367 --> 11:02.078

<i>like a soldier in the military.</i>

11:18.135 --> 11:21.847
<i>-When you do that and I say I don't like--</i>
<i>-I didn't get mad you got your license.</i>

11:21.931 --> 11:24.600
<i>I got mad because to</i>
<i>have somebody else come tell me,</i>

11:24.684 --> 11:28.062
<i>it didn't look right and didn't sit right.</i>

<i>I was able to get Peter</i>

13:50.538 --> 13:54.583
<i>-That's major, girl. Major move!</i>
-I mean… [laughing]

13:54.667 --> 13:59.463

<i>We've been together since college.</i>
<i>We're a team.</i>

14:29.952 --> 14:35.207
<i>So, for Michael, I really had to help</i>
<i>that transition to life after football,</i>

14:35.291 --> 14:39.712
<i>and I didn't really focus on me.</i>
<i>Now is my time to focus on Alexis.</i>

14:40.754 --> 14:43.340
<i>Sharelle and I had</i>
<i>a conversation last week,</i>

14:43.424 --> 14:47.344
<i>and she kind of was like, "Alexis,</i>
<i>you need to meet my expectations."</i>

14:47.428 --> 14:48.262
<i>[Michael] Yeah.</i>

14:48.345 --> 14:50.306
<i>And I'm like…</i>
<i>All I could do is just sit there.</i>

14:50.389 --> 14:52.641

<i>be that agent that's "making excuses."</i>

14:52.725 --> 14:53.559
<i>-You know?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

14:53.642 --> 14:56.103

<i>-Remember me telling you about Tennille?</i>
<i>-Yeah, I know.</i>

14:59.231 --> 15:00.441
<i>-All of our issues…</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

15:01.567 --> 15:03.903
<i>That's the girl</i>
<i>who you showed, like, four houses--</i>

15:03.986 --> 15:07.156
<i>Yeah, since I felt like she was</i>
<i>using me and collecting all the money.</i>

15:07.239 --> 15:09.158
<i>-That's, like, not professional.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

15:09.241 --> 15:11.785
<i>You know me, if I'm doin'</i>
<i>work for somebody, it's gonna charge.</i>

15:11.869 --> 15:14.163
<i>-I'm charging you full price.</i>
<i>-[laughs] Right.</i>

15:14.246 --> 15:17.124
<i>It's gonna cost you some money.</i>
<i>She was not liking that.</i>

15:17.207 --> 15:19.501
<i>Tennille had me</i>
<i>show several homes for her.</i>

15:19.585 --> 15:21.712
<i>And when they sold,</i>
<i>she refused to give me a commission.</i>

15:21.795 --> 15:23.088
<i>My time is money.</i>

15:23.172 --> 15:26.008
<i>If I'm gonna do something</i>
<i>for someone, I have to get paid.</i>

15:26.091 --> 15:28.677
<i>If I'm not getting paid,</i>
<i>I'm not showing up to do the job.</i>

15:28.761 --> 15:30.596
<i>[Michael] So how your days been going?</i>

15:31.347 --> 15:35.976
<i>Me and Tennille, we go see</i>
<i>this beautiful $12,000,000 house together.</i>

15:36.060 --> 15:38.354
<i>When we were literally</i>
<i>at the end of the tour,</i>

15:38.437 --> 15:40.272
<i>do you know she asked me,</i>

15:40.356 --> 15:44.860
<i>did I have a buyer I can bring that was</i>
<i>actually pre-qualified or pre-approved?</i>

15:44.944 --> 15:47.738
<i>Like, basically have the funds</i>
<i>to actually buy that house?</i>

15:47.821 --> 15:53.243
<i>I don't know, she almost talks down on me</i>
<i>and just underestimates me as an agent.</i>

15:53.327 --> 15:55.204
<i>That is the most annoying,</i>
<i>frustrating thing,</i>

15:55.287 --> 15:56.914
<i>because I feel she doesn't know me.</i>

15:56.997 --> 15:59.416
<i>I just really want you</i>
<i>to just stay focused.</i>

15:59.500 --> 16:03.921

<i>and getting your clients and…</i>

16:04.004 --> 16:04.922
<i>-Of course.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

16:05.005 --> 16:06.799
<i>I'm gonna make sure I sell that house.</i>

16:06.882 --> 16:11.345
<i>I'm going to make sure I bring a buyer</i>
<i>who's beyond pre-approved for that home.</i>

18:56.552 --> 18:58.720
<i>in your career as an agent?</i>

18:58.804 --> 19:02.599
<i>[sighs] Well, what I will say is that…</i>

19:02.683 --> 19:05.936
<i>definitely something that</i>
<i>I'd probably be open to, to be honest.</i>

19:06.019 --> 19:09.022
<i>-[Rena] Okay.</i>
<i>-When you talk about not feeling valued,</i>

19:09.106 --> 19:10.774
<i>I'm right there with you.</i>

19:11.525 --> 19:13.569
<i>So, just wait a minute.</i>

19:13.652 --> 19:18.365
<i>So you're thinking about opening up your</i>
<i>own brokerage to compete with Sharelle</i>

19:18.448 --> 19:21.910
<i>and recruit two of her best agents?</i>

19:21.994 --> 19:23.203
<i>I mean, really, Rena?</i>

19:23.287 --> 19:26.331
<i>If I were going to leave,</i>
<i>wouldn't I recruit her two best agents?</i>

19:26.415 --> 19:28.917
<i>-[chuckles]</i>
<i>-But that is just… What? And then…</i>

19:29.001 --> 19:31.503
<i>I'm shocked that you</i>
<i>would even consider that.</i>

19:31.587 --> 19:34.882
<i>I mean, considering everything</i>
<i>that's going on at the brokerage,</i>

19:34.965 --> 19:37.551
<i>I don't know why</i>
<i>you wouldn't consider that.</i>

19:38.218 --> 19:44.558
<i>I've expressed to you guys openly that</i>
<i>I'm not feeling valued in my position.</i>

19:44.641 --> 19:47.561
<i>So that's my own issue with Sharelle,</i>

19:47.644 --> 19:50.439
<i>but outside of that, I'm extremely loyal.</i>

19:50.522 --> 19:52.357
<i>[Anne] It's not going against Sharelle--</i>

19:52.441 --> 19:56.236
<i>However, there are relationships</i>
<i>that have been established,</i>

19:56.320 --> 19:59.948
<i>so we can say it's business all day long,</i>
<i>but think about the backstory--</i>

20:00.032 --> 20:03.452
<i>It's not just me saying it's business.</i>
<i>Sharelle said it's business, not personal.</i>

20:03.535 --> 20:05.245
<i>-[Anne] Exactly.</i>
<i>-Well, hey, I just can't.</i>

20:05.329 --> 20:09.458
<i>I mean, great for you. You know,</i>
<i>I love women doing their own thing,</i>

20:09.541 --> 20:13.128
<i>like, more power to you,</i>
<i>but I'm never gonna go against Sharelle.</i>

20:13.212 --> 20:14.296
<i>I think that's crazy.</i>

20:14.379 --> 20:16.340
<i>[Anne] You're looking</i>
<i>from the wrong perspective.</i>

20:16.423 --> 20:20.010
<i>No, I don't think so. I'm looking at it</i>
<i>from exactly what we were talking about.</i>

20:20.093 --> 20:21.720
<i>No! It's not going against Sharelle.</i>

20:21.803 --> 20:24.473
<i>Not one time did Rena say,</i>
<i>"Going against Sharelle."</i>

20:24.556 --> 20:26.266
<i>In the same city? It's like, what?</i>

20:26.350 --> 20:27.935
<i>Rena is just out of line,</i>

20:28.018 --> 20:31.647
<i>because her and Sharelle</i>
<i>had a relationship before real estate,</i>

20:31.730 --> 20:36.485
<i>and now you want to turn around and</i>
<i>do the same thing that Sharelle is doing?</i>

20:36.568 --> 20:37.903
<i>It's just out of line.</i>

20:37.986 --> 20:40.530
<i>Anne has me really</i>
<i>looking at her differently.</i>

20:40.614 --> 20:41.823
<i>I'm just like…</i>

20:41.907 --> 20:43.116
<i>Girl!</i>

20:43.617 --> 20:48.497
<i>I never would have thought</i>
<i>she would even be open to Rena's idea.</i>

20:48.580 --> 20:50.540
<i>At the end of the day,</i>
<i>we're two different people,</i>

20:50.624 --> 20:52.542
<i>we came to Allure at different times, so…</i>

20:52.626 --> 20:55.003
<i>-We've been rocking, me and you, Rena.</i>
<i>-[Rena] Mm-hmm.</i>

20:55.087 --> 20:56.421
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-We're the first agents.</i>

20:56.505 --> 21:00.509
<i>-Rocking with her since day one!</i>
<i>-Rocking hard with Allure since day one.</i>

21:00.592 --> 21:02.552
<i>But if I've come</i>
<i>to the end of my road there,</i>

21:02.636 --> 21:05.681
<i>if there's nothing else I can do</i>
<i>to help other than make it money,</i>

21:05.764 --> 21:09.101
<i>well, then, what am I…</i>
<i>I have to go out on my own.</i>

<i>-How are you ladies doing?</i>
<i>-[Tennille] Hello.</i>

21:26.994 --> 21:29.037
<i>-Good morning!</i>
<i>-Juawana, can I see you for a sec?</i>

21:29.121 --> 21:29.955
<i>Okay.</i>

21:31.081 --> 21:33.041
<i>Mmm. A private meeting.</i>

<i>-Good morning.</i>

21:40.215 --> 21:42.676
<i>-Good, how are you?</i>
<i>-A little frustrated.</i>

21:42.759 --> 21:43.885
<i>Why, what happened?</i>

21:43.969 --> 21:45.721
<i>The Farley mansion is under contract.</i>

21:45.804 --> 21:46.972
<i>With Anne's client?</i>

21:47.055 --> 21:48.807
<i>-No!</i>
<i>-Oh.</i>

21:48.890 --> 21:53.145
<i>I told her, I said,</i>
<i>"Anne, this is a seller's market."</i>

21:53.228 --> 21:54.604
<i>The market is very competitive.</i>

21:54.688 --> 21:57.607
<i>She worried about everything else,</i>
<i>not paying attention to the market.</i>

21:57.691 --> 22:00.193
<i>-I wonder if she even knows it's pending.</i>
<i>-She probably don't.</i>

22:00.277 --> 22:01.987
<i>'Cause she talking too damn much.</i>

22:02.070 --> 22:04.948
<i>And I told her ass,</i>
<i>but she thinks she know everything!</i>

22:05.032 --> 22:06.825
<i>Anne thinks I'm very hard on her.</i>

22:06.908 --> 22:08.577
<i>I'm hard on her because I care.</i>

22:08.660 --> 22:12.331
<i>I'm trying to show her. It's tough love.</i>
<i>I'm telling her, "We can't do this,</i>

22:12.414 --> 22:15.417
<i>just present any offer,</i>
<i>but just because it's a million dollars…"</i>

22:15.500 --> 22:16.960
<i>It makes us look so bad.</i>

22:17.961 --> 22:19.755
<i>-Matter of fact, Juawana, go get her.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

22:20.881 --> 22:24.259
<i>Put yourself in the seller's shoes.</i>
<i>It's a slap in the face, Anne.</i>

22:25.218 --> 22:27.054
<i>-[Anne] You saw my booty?</i>
<i>-[all] Ooh!</i>

22:27.137 --> 22:31.391
<i>Well, that's the point. [laughs]</i>
<i>I just don't want my coochie to show.</i>

22:31.475 --> 22:33.393
<i>Anne-Sophie,</i>
<i>we'd like to see you in the office.</i>

22:33.477 --> 22:36.438
<i>-Oh! To principal's office I go.</i>
<i>-[Rena] What is that about?</i>

22:36.521 --> 22:39.608
<i>-[Tennille] Could be the skirt.</i>
<i>-[Anne] Tennille, mind your business.</i>

22:40.692 --> 22:41.651
<i>[Sharelle] Have a seat.</i>

22:43.779 --> 22:44.988
<i>So, what is this about?</i>

22:45.072 --> 22:47.324
<i>How's everything going with your buyer?</i>

22:47.908 --> 22:50.535
<i>-Which one?</i>
<i>-The one for the Farley mansion.</i>

22:50.619 --> 22:53.955
<i>Oh, Peter. I was actually able</i>
<i>to bring him up about one million,</i>

22:54.039 --> 22:57.000
<i>so we're at four million,</i>
<i>and I plan on submitting that offer.</i>

22:57.709 --> 22:58.710
<i>Hmm.</i>

22:59.294 --> 23:00.379
<i>Okay.</i>

23:01.338 --> 23:02.964
<i>It's pending. Did you know that?</i>

23:04.549 --> 23:08.261
<i>Um, I did not know that,</i>
<i>but I also didn't check this morning.</i>

23:08.345 --> 23:09.721
<i>Um…</i>

23:09.805 --> 23:10.639
<i>Well?</i>

23:10.722 --> 23:12.933
<i>The offer hasn't even been submitted.</i>

23:13.016 --> 23:15.435
<i>You entertained the offer,</i>
<i>you didn't complete the offer,</i>

23:15.519 --> 23:17.229
<i>because nothing has been even submitted.</i>

23:17.312 --> 23:18.939
<i>He asked me to put in an offer.</i>

23:19.022 --> 23:22.192
<i>Um, I guess before I could</i>
<i>submit the offer someone else did,</i>

23:22.275 --> 23:24.319
<i>and, you know,</i>
<i>that's just the way the game rolls.</i>

23:24.403 --> 23:25.821
<i>How much was the offer?</i>

23:25.904 --> 23:27.656
<i>Seven million cash.</i>

23:27.739 --> 23:28.990
<i>Maybe that's good feedback.</i>

23:29.074 --> 23:32.494
<i>-Seven million cash. A big difference.</i>
<i>-[Juawana] That's a significant offer.</i>

23:32.577 --> 23:34.287
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-Okay. Well, that's good for them.</i>

23:34.371 --> 23:37.207
<i>The offer that you brought in,</i>
<i>it's like a slap in the face.</i>

23:37.290 --> 23:39.000
<i>Okay, but my duty is to the client.</i>

23:39.084 --> 23:42.295
<i>The reason why I drove back to</i>
<i>the property was to advise him to come up.</i>

23:42.379 --> 23:44.047
<i>You're wasting everyone's time.</i>

23:44.131 --> 23:47.134
<i>You're not new to this.</i>
<i>You have to be more on your buyers.</i>

23:47.217 --> 23:50.804
<i>You have to keep it real with them</i>
<i>and let them know, "We gotta get on it."</i>

23:50.887 --> 23:54.141
<i>Okay, but it was something. It was</i>
<i>something to open up the conversation.</i>

23:54.224 --> 23:57.227
<i>While y'all getting the conversation</i>
<i>started, someone's putting an offer.</i>

23:57.310 --> 23:59.354
<i>-The home is under contract.</i>
<i>-Right, but why…</i>

23:59.438 --> 24:01.815
<i>Why take no for an answer</i>
<i>and not submit and not try?</i>

24:01.898 --> 24:02.983
<i>Just listen to me, Anne.</i>

24:03.066 --> 24:07.320
<i>The land is worth more than three million</i>
<i>on a waterfront property.</i>

24:07.404 --> 24:08.905
<i>Well, there are many waterfront--</i>

24:08.989 --> 24:13.326
<i>I'm telling you this, get it together.</i>
<i>Stop letting people waste your time.</i>

24:13.410 --> 24:15.245
<i>I'm not in the business</i>
<i>of wasting my time.</i>

24:15.328 --> 24:18.039
<i>However, I'm not in the business</i>
<i>of pressuring people.</i>

24:18.123 --> 24:19.249
<i>It's not pressuring.</i>

24:19.332 --> 24:20.750
<i>It's about keeping it real.</i>

24:20.834 --> 24:22.377
<i>-I keep it real.</i>
<i>-Being realistic.</i>

24:22.461 --> 24:25.547
<i>Anne coming to me</i>
<i>with this $4,000,000 offer…</i>

24:25.630 --> 24:27.757
<i>Anne, come on,</i>
<i>I taught you better than this.</i>

24:27.841 --> 24:30.677
<i>We're not about to look desperate,</i>
<i>we're not about to look like a fool.</i>

24:30.760 --> 24:33.805
<i>A $3,000,000 offer and then</i>
<i>coming up to four, that wasn't--</i>

24:33.889 --> 24:36.057
<i>You should've told him,</i>
<i>"This is a low-ass offer."</i>

24:36.141 --> 24:39.227
<i>The goal was to get</i>
<i>an offer out of this party.</i>

24:39.311 --> 24:41.771
<i>-I did that. I--</i>
<i>-The goal was to sell the home.</i>

24:42.981 --> 24:46.943
<i>Sharelle should be happy that I was</i>
<i>able to bring Peter up an extra million,</i>

24:47.027 --> 24:48.737
<i>not scolding me.</i>

24:48.820 --> 24:50.447
<i>It's just not motivating.</i>

24:50.530 --> 24:53.366
<i>That's all I need to talk to you about.</i>
<i>Meeting adjourned.</i>

24:53.450 --> 24:54.493
<i>[Anne] Thanks.</i>

24:59.581 --> 25:01.500
<i>She still don't fucking get it.</i>

25:05.170 --> 25:06.463
<i>I'm taking a lunch.</i>
