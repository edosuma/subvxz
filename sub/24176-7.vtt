<i>The small, hard-working beavers</i>

00:35.369 --> 00:37.781
<i>keep the waters
of their valleys clean...</i>

00:39.540 --> 00:41.451
Will you get it, Viola?

00:42.209 --> 00:43.950
No, come on...

00:49.049 --> 00:53.839
AUGUST 2nd

00:55.806 --> 00:57.797
- Sir.
- Notte!

00:58.016 --> 01:00.053
- Come in.
- "Denaro lo tentò".

01:00.561 --> 01:02.143
Pardon?

01:02.354 --> 01:06.939
It's an anagram of your name,
it means: "Money tempted him“.

01:07.150 --> 01:07.890
I see.

01:09.695 --> 01:11.936
I heard you had a nice holiday.

01:12.155 --> 01:14.146
I told you I wanted to talk
to Berlusconi.

01:14.366 --> 01:17.984
Fly too close to the sun
and you'll get burnt.

01:18.203 --> 01:22.162
Have you come to fire me?
You can't, I no longer work for you.

01:22.249 --> 01:26.709
Enjoy the rest of your holiday,
we're opening for business again soon.

01:29.131 --> 01:31.042
I persuaded him!

01:32.342 --> 01:34.379
We'll see you at
the Publitalia convention.

01:35.178 --> 01:37.215
See you in Montecarlo.

01:46.148 --> 01:47.513
What's up?

01:48.984 --> 01:51.146
Mum called.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.731
Uncle Fabrizio...

02:08.044 --> 02:10.377
Hey, don't be like this.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.548
He was ill, you saw.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.335
He's no longer suffering now.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.263
I'm not crying about that.

02:26.438 --> 02:29.806
It's because I'll have to go home now.

03:16.238 --> 03:19.902
- You work on Sundays too?
- I've loads of stuff to review.

03:20.742 --> 03:23.484
Lorenzon is testifying
before the Committee.

03:24.121 --> 03:25.987
I need to study.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.369
I'm thirsty.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.262
Veronica!

03:53.358 --> 03:56.100
Don't you recognize me?
It's me, Lucio!

04:00.240 --> 04:02.652
Aren't you going to say hello?

04:02.826 --> 04:06.239
I think I saw you on TV
a while back.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.614
I've made progress with my career.

04:10.208 --> 04:12.165
Great! Congratulations!

04:12.377 --> 04:16.870
I have too, I'm assistant director
of Publitalia now.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.253
And you're still married.

04:21.636 --> 04:23.752
I can see you remember me.

04:28.351 --> 04:32.345
I'm going to Montecarlo next week
for a work convention.

04:32.564 --> 04:35.431
All of TV's best will be there,
even Berlusconi!

04:35.567 --> 04:38.559
If you come with me,
you'll get to meet him.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.483
Five-star hotel, you know...

04:44.534 --> 04:46.866
My boyfriend's coming back.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.741
It's best you go, trust me.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.628
Thank you.

05:03.887 --> 05:06.754
- Who was he?
- Just a guy...

05:10.018 --> 05:14.603
He invited me to Montecarlo
to attend the Publitalia convention.

05:16.316 --> 05:20.776
He wants me to meet Berlusconi
and screw me in a five-star hotel.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.111
And what did you say?

05:28.954 --> 05:33.289
That I already have a man
who takes care of me, right?

05:49.432 --> 05:50.843
- Miss...
- Thank you.

05:51.977 --> 05:53.888
Bibi, wait!

05:56.273 --> 05:57.729
Bibi.

06:00.318 --> 06:02.150
I couldn't do it.

06:02.654 --> 06:07.273
- Leave me alone.
- You didn't change your mind.

06:09.661 --> 06:11.572
They forced you to.

06:12.122 --> 06:15.535
Somebody threatened you,
I'll help you!

06:15.750 --> 06:19.744
Just tell me the truth.
Tell me the truth, Bibi!

06:19.963 --> 06:25.254
The truth is there's no proof
that my father did what you say.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.506
I'm sorry.

06:34.978 --> 06:37.595
- And now you want revenge!
- I want to understand.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.555
Understand what, dammit?

06:39.774 --> 06:43.563
She said she'd help you
then screwed you over.

06:45.572 --> 06:48.280
I'm having another one,
all right?

06:56.833 --> 06:59.746
Anyway,
it's a shit period for me too.

06:59.961 --> 07:01.952
Have you lost more money?

07:02.172 --> 07:04.209
I'm going to a funeral tomorrow.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.339
A colleague.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.961
Who was like a father to me.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.547
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry...

07:12.766 --> 07:16.760
This isn't why you called me,
how can I help you?

07:16.978 --> 07:19.094
I can't get my head round it.

07:19.648 --> 07:22.561
That account could contain
the proof I need,

07:22.776 --> 07:25.859
it may lead to who Mainaghi
bought the blood from.

07:27.572 --> 07:30.234
And if you don't hurry,
she'll make it disappear.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.108
Exactly.

07:33.828 --> 07:37.787
You know what?
When you've been dealt a shit hand...

07:39.376 --> 07:42.368
the only thing you can rely on
is psychology.

07:43.964 --> 07:47.332
Someone must have it in for
Miss Mainaghi, right?

08:12.158 --> 08:15.367
What's happened to your witness,
Honorable Bosco?

08:15.578 --> 08:19.321
He's coming, he was held up.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.323
- He's coming.
- I'm sorry,

08:21.376 --> 08:24.960
but if the witness
Massimo Lorenzon doesn't show up,

08:25.338 --> 08:28.547
I'm afraid that your investigation...

08:30.176 --> 08:32.292
If my colleagues agree,
I propose we move on

08:32.554 --> 08:35.171
to the next point on our agenda.

08:35.974 --> 08:38.341
Waiting for Godot!

08:45.150 --> 08:47.107
Call Lorenzon.

08:47.318 --> 08:49.730
Massimo Lorenzon, first floor.
Move it.

08:49.904 --> 08:54.774
- He's left.
- Like fuck he has! Lorenzon!

08:54.993 --> 08:58.202
He left last night,
with his suitcase.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.533
Three men came to get him.

09:00.749 --> 09:04.162
- Three men came to get him?
- Yes.

09:04.335 --> 09:06.542
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

09:08.173 --> 09:11.165
The public prosecutor knows about
our money in Switzerland.

09:11.301 --> 09:13.963
He's reopening the investigation.

09:15.680 --> 09:19.765
- How did he find out?
- Don't you ever make mistakes?

09:20.018 --> 09:22.430
Is your mistake called Luca Pasture?

09:22.562 --> 09:27.773
I see you all know plenty
about my private life, that's great.

09:27.942 --> 09:30.309
What does one do in these cases?

09:30.570 --> 09:32.311
It's very simple...

09:32.572 --> 09:36.736
You just need to find someone
who takes 5 billion off the books

09:36.951 --> 09:40.160
and makes it disappear,
simple as that.

09:40.330 --> 09:44.540
- Is there someone who can do that?
- Yes, a revenue officer friend.

09:45.168 --> 09:50.334
- What kind of revenue officer?
- Those who don't leave their cards.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.669
I see you know a lot of criminals.

09:53.176 --> 09:57.591
If there weren't any bad people,
there'd be no good lawyers.

10:07.816 --> 10:11.150
- Maggioni!
- What can I do for you?

10:11.903 --> 10:15.567
What have you done to Lorenzon?
Did you make him disappear?

10:15.740 --> 10:18.903
You think we kidnapped him?
Your friend is fine.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.985
Bullshit!

10:21.204 --> 10:23.571
We look after our men.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.373
Even when they make
unfounded accusations.

10:30.755 --> 10:33.122
This is the best clinic in Europe.

10:33.299 --> 10:37.964
Lorenzon will receive top treatment,
at our expense.

10:39.556 --> 10:43.299
If you don't believe me,
go to Switzerland to check.

11:01.703 --> 11:04.115
Pastore, why are you here?

11:05.123 --> 11:06.705
Sir...

11:08.001 --> 11:12.336
Zaffra, Davigo is sending out
the arrest warrant.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.844
Did you have a good trip?

11:26.227 --> 11:29.811
Borsellino was on that black list too.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.028
Why was he still in Palermo?

11:39.073 --> 11:41.940
I don't know,
maybe it was his decision to stay.

11:43.578 --> 11:45.740
Or maybe they didn't warn him.

11:47.916 --> 11:50.203
I'm losing sleep over it.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.333
This country can't change.

11:55.757 --> 11:58.340
They're doing their best
to prevent it.

12:01.095 --> 12:05.089
There's no point in trying,
it's useless.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.592
Those who try, die.

12:09.979 --> 12:12.562
You're changing this country.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.767
They won't allow us to, Pastore.

12:22.325 --> 12:26.569
I'll be next door,
switch everything off when you leave.

12:26.955 --> 12:29.196
I'm not leaving.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.314
I'm not going to disappear.

12:57.402 --> 13:00.144
<i>Milan 's prosecutor has issued
5 more arrest warrants</i>

13:00.321 --> 13:02.028
<i>for 5 industrialists.</i>

13:02.115 --> 13:05.278
<i>Zaffra 's in valved in the inquiry
into illegal party financing</i>

13:05.326 --> 13:07.567
<i>and the subway contracts.</i>

13:17.547 --> 13:19.754
Wasn't that our exit?

13:22.260 --> 13:24.171
Call your mother,

13:24.304 --> 13:27.638
tell her we'll go directly
to the funeral tomorrow.

15:11.911 --> 15:16.451
Beef up the security here,
anyone can walk in.

15:22.964 --> 15:25.251
Zeno Mainaghi, right?

15:25.383 --> 15:28.296
What was your father thinking
calling you Zeno...

15:28.636 --> 15:32.800
like that guy in the book
who can never make decisions.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.767
Your father knew who you were
before you were born.

15:37.979 --> 15:41.597
- What do you want? Who are you?
- But he still trusted you.

15:41.691 --> 15:46.561
So much so you were joint signatory
on all of his bank accounts.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.522
Evidently
you didn't deserve his trust.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.692
So he chose your sister.

15:56.330 --> 15:59.448
You've done your homework.
ls this the story of my life?

15:59.542 --> 16:01.874
Yes, but now comes
the interesting part.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.036
You can seek revenge.

16:06.674 --> 16:09.211
Do you want to take
your sister's place?

16:11.846 --> 16:14.133
I'm giving you an opportunity.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.932
I'm thirsty.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.184
Alcantara!

16:26.068 --> 16:30.733
- Where the hell is he?
- I know you have a Swiss account.

16:30.948 --> 16:33.315
So, let's do this...

16:34.410 --> 16:36.742
You grant me free access
to that account...

16:38.414 --> 16:40.997
and I'll repair your reputation.

16:41.876 --> 16:47.167
"Young Mainaghi, after refusing
to join in the family's corrupt affairs,

16:47.340 --> 16:51.299
decides to help the judges
and after making a clean sweep,

16:51.552 --> 16:53.884
he takes back what's rightfully his...

16:53.971 --> 16:55.427
Sir?

16:55.973 --> 16:58.556
Bring me some water, sparkling.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.971
Right away!

17:01.145 --> 17:03.762
And see the gentleman out.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.599
I know the way.

17:21.915 --> 17:24.749
- You're leaving?
- It's a work trip.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.079
A couple of days.

17:28.089 --> 17:30.080
Aren't you forgetting something?

17:33.177 --> 17:34.713
No.

17:36.806 --> 17:38.888
We made a deal.

17:39.267 --> 17:41.850
- You said you'd help me.
- I don't have time now.

17:41.978 --> 17:45.937
- I'm the one who has no time!
- I've more important things to do.

17:46.148 --> 17:50.563
Plus I don't want to be an ass-licker
in order to get you work.

17:52.530 --> 17:55.272
If you walk out, I'm leaving!

17:55.449 --> 17:57.565
I'll go to Montecarlo.

18:01.289 --> 18:04.327
I shouldn't have beaten that actor up.

18:05.543 --> 18:07.955
He was right to call you a slut.

18:08.296 --> 18:12.164
That's what you are, a slut.

18:12.300 --> 18:17.170
You like being with a slut,
it's paying that bothers you.

18:19.140 --> 18:21.552
Do whatever you fucking want!

18:34.905 --> 18:36.646
My condolences.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.280
- My condolences.
- Thank you.

18:42.580 --> 18:44.162
I'm sorry.

18:45.416 --> 18:47.077
Marina...

18:50.504 --> 18:52.586
- I came as soon as I could.
- Don't worry.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.961
This is Leo, Viola's father.
Rocco, Fabrizio's friend.

18:56.177 --> 18:57.713
- Hello.
- Hello.

19:03.100 --> 19:06.513
Now I'm the only one
who knows your secret.

19:15.321 --> 19:16.903
Bye, Marina.

19:22.203 --> 19:23.364
I'm sorry.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.209
- My condolences.
- Thank you.

19:34.048 --> 19:37.336
- For Viola, anything you need...
- Thanks.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.386
You've been great with her.

19:42.306 --> 19:44.547
I wasn't expecting it.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.176
- I'm very sorry.
- Thank you.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.936
Here we are!

19:57.279 --> 19:59.520
Come on, don't look at me like that.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.277
It's better to suffer
when you're young,

20:02.368 --> 20:05.577
your immune system gets strong
and then you'll live happily.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.825
I'll miss your cynicism.

20:09.667 --> 20:11.954
Don't worry, it runs in the family.

20:32.189 --> 20:33.679
Bye.

20:58.340 --> 20:59.922
L-Hi.

21:02.219 --> 21:04.881
They wilt so quickly in this heat.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.555
- A friend of hers?
- An acquaintance.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.305
I've not seen you here before.

21:11.562 --> 21:14.179
I haven't come back
to Bologna in ages.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.310
Too many memories.

21:16.567 --> 21:20.026
I live off my memories,
I come every week.

21:20.905 --> 21:25.365
- I can't help it.
- Bianca would be happy.

21:25.951 --> 21:29.114
If anyone ever forgot about her,
she went nuts.

21:29.330 --> 21:32.038
For an acquaintance,
you knew her well.

21:35.961 --> 21:39.124
"Her, so loved".

21:39.673 --> 21:41.960
Orpheus and Eurydice.

21:42.718 --> 21:46.302
- Do you know the poem?
- No.

21:46.847 --> 21:48.804
It's beautiful.

21:49.308 --> 21:52.846
But there's a version of the myth
that I prefer.

21:53.896 --> 21:56.354
"The lnconsolable One", by Pavese.

21:56.941 --> 22:00.775
Forgive me, I'm a retired teacher.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.854
What's it about?

22:05.950 --> 22:10.319
When Orpheus descends into Hades
to bring Eurydice back to life,

22:10.663 --> 22:12.404
and he turns to look at her,

22:12.748 --> 22:15.160
sending her back into the darkness...

22:15.543 --> 22:18.331
He didn't do it by accident, no.

22:18.712 --> 22:19.998
He did it on purpose.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.002
To make her disappear for good,

22:24.343 --> 22:26.300
to be rid of her.

22:26.554 --> 22:29.967
He hadn't gone down there
to look for his beloved,

22:30.140 --> 22:32.302
but to find himself.

22:34.144 --> 22:39.935
We all have to descend
into our own hell, at least once.

22:46.115 --> 22:51.326
VENTHONE, SWITZERLAND

22:58.168 --> 22:59.624
There he is.

23:06.302 --> 23:09.545
- Why are you here?
- I've come to ask you that!

23:09.638 --> 23:11.595
Please, no shouting!

23:11.682 --> 23:13.764
All right, don't worry, it's fine.

23:15.311 --> 23:17.348
- Well...
- What?

23:18.188 --> 23:20.771
Massimo, I stuck my neck out for you,

23:20.941 --> 23:24.150
I risked my reputation
in front of everyone.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.937
I did it because you asked me to.

23:27.573 --> 23:30.406
And you left me there
all alone like a fool?

23:30.659 --> 23:33.151
You're coming with me to testify,
understood?

23:33.329 --> 23:36.538
I don't know why I got ill.

23:36.957 --> 23:41.167
If it was the depleted uranium,
Saddam's oil wells...

23:41.337 --> 23:44.295
or my neighbor
with his asbestos roof.

23:44.715 --> 23:48.299
I just kicked up a fuss
so they'd help me.

23:52.640 --> 23:53.880
Bullshit!

23:55.309 --> 23:57.300
You let them buy you.

23:59.271 --> 24:02.855
No. I'm letting them cure me.

24:05.027 --> 24:06.893
Go ahead and judge me.

24:07.780 --> 24:11.193
I can understand
that you're mad at me.

24:12.660 --> 24:14.947
I didn't want to get you involved.

24:16.747 --> 24:20.331
But if there's any hope of survival,
it's thanks to this place.

24:20.876 --> 24:22.332
Dammit...

24:22.419 --> 24:25.537
Shit, I should've known!

24:27.174 --> 24:29.962
Once a coward, always a coward.

24:30.177 --> 24:32.544
You're a coward, Massimo.

24:42.940 --> 24:45.773
<i>- Hello?
- It's me.</i>

24:46.568 --> 24:48.559
I'm coming home.

24:48.862 --> 24:50.728
<i>I won't be here.</i>

24:51.573 --> 24:55.441
<i>- Where are you going?
- You know where, anything to say?</i>

24:55.869 --> 24:59.863
I've got a plane to catch and a career
to think of, seeing no one else will.

25:19.977 --> 25:23.140
<i>- Hello?
- Know what they let me do?</i>

25:23.313 --> 25:25.554
- <i>Who</i> is <i>this?</i>
- <i>Public relations.</i>

25:25.774 --> 25:29.358
<i>Like all I can do
is organize parties, like a fool.</i>

25:29.445 --> 25:33.564
<i>- Zeno, is that you?
- We 're leaving at' .9 A.M. Be ready.</i>

25:45.669 --> 25:48.536
- I don't have any money.
- I don't have any money!

25:50.007 --> 25:53.295
Look what I found!
You kept it, didn't you?

25:53.510 --> 25:57.299
You're an asshole!
Why are you here?

25:57.765 --> 26:00.132
- Give me that, idiot.
- Take it.

26:00.309 --> 26:04.974
Are you drunk?
You stink of alcohol.

26:05.939 --> 26:07.680
- You're slow.
- Are you nuts?

26:07.900 --> 26:11.768
- You're slow.
- Put it away, it might be loaded.

26:21.747 --> 26:23.784
Happy now?

26:24.416 --> 26:27.829
Even though I work in Parliament,
I'm still an idiot.

26:31.215 --> 26:33.001
Give it to me, come on.

26:35.177 --> 26:39.546
I've got my own damn problems!
A client who owed me went bust.

26:39.765 --> 26:43.133
Those bastards at the bank
won't give me any credit.

26:43.310 --> 26:45.551
I'll have to close shop for good.

26:45.771 --> 26:48.559
And this dimwit
is playing with guns!

26:48.774 --> 26:51.141
Don't worry, I'm going anyway.

26:51.318 --> 26:53.935
You can't drive to Rome
in that state!

26:54.154 --> 26:57.567
Hasn't life taught you anything?

26:58.742 --> 27:01.154
I'm on my own this time, right?

27:01.703 --> 27:04.115
Even if I kill myself...

27:26.103 --> 27:28.344
I feel so bad about Milo.

27:28.981 --> 27:31.018
I'm sorry!

28:05.684 --> 28:07.846
Pietro, what the...

28:08.770 --> 28:10.056
What are you doing?

28:10.272 --> 28:11.387
Pietro!

28:12.441 --> 28:14.933
Wake up, come on!

28:16.904 --> 28:18.611
Hold on...

28:20.616 --> 28:22.198
Dammit!

28:22.409 --> 28:25.367
Careful, come on!
You weigh a ton!

28:25.579 --> 28:30.164
- Put this leg in, come on!
- I feel dizzy, wait a minute.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.500
Feet in, come on.

28:37.382 --> 28:38.998
My dear Bosco...

28:39.218 --> 28:42.756
you need to understand that in Italy
if you want to cover something up

28:42.971 --> 28:46.965
the best way to do it is
to start a parliamentary inquiry.

28:47.142 --> 28:49.509
I've ended up
looking like an asshole.

28:51.563 --> 28:53.770
I wanted to do something good.

28:54.775 --> 28:58.143
- I'm just an asshole.
- Enough!

28:59.363 --> 29:05.075
Self-pity is one of the few things
that's forbidden in this house.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.659
With Veronica too...

29:08.163 --> 29:09.995
What happened?

29:13.502 --> 29:17.211
- She left?
- I let her down.

29:17.547 --> 29:21.586
That's what we men do to women,
we let them down.

29:22.177 --> 29:23.759
Never mind.

29:23.971 --> 29:27.180
She wanted me to help her
get some TV work.

29:27.766 --> 29:31.304
I don't want to do certain things
to get her work.

29:32.020 --> 29:36.184
Plus, even if I did,
I know jack shit about TV!

29:36.566 --> 29:38.773
That's not a problem.

29:38.944 --> 29:43.359
It wouldn't be the first time
I've helped out a girl in need.

29:43.824 --> 29:45.360
Quite the opposite...

29:55.085 --> 29:58.874
Pizzetti? It's Gaetano Nobile.

29:58.964 --> 30:02.958
I'm calling
because my friend's girlfriend...

30:04.344 --> 30:08.008
needs to find work.
Her name's Veronica.

30:09.266 --> 30:10.927
Castello?

31:05.364 --> 31:07.571
Nice to meet you, have a seat.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.614
We understand the difficulties,
Mr De Boer.

31:12.829 --> 31:15.537
But we can transfer the money today

31:15.749 --> 31:19.162
and hope that you can receive it

31:19.378 --> 31:21.961
and help us
like you have in the past.

31:22.172 --> 31:25.540
I have fond memories
of Mr Mainaghi.

31:26.176 --> 31:28.759
A man with great experience.

31:30.764 --> 31:32.755
My condolences.

31:32.974 --> 31:35.306
De Boer is a Dutch name, right?

31:35.977 --> 31:37.968
My father is Dutch.

31:38.146 --> 31:40.137
I grew up in Paris.

31:40.440 --> 31:44.229
Now that Michele Mainaghi's gone,

31:44.444 --> 31:46.936
we have to reorganize the company.

31:47.447 --> 31:50.985
- As a matter of caution...
- You're asking me to enter

31:51.201 --> 31:54.444
a house in flames
and bring out the silverware.

31:55.372 --> 31:58.239
Why should I agree to get burnt?

31:58.458 --> 32:01.041
The reward would be substantial.

32:01.253 --> 32:04.666
- Afstandsbediening.
- Pardon?

32:04.881 --> 32:08.419
"Afstandsbediening"
is the only Dutch word I know.

32:08.844 --> 32:13.179
- It means "remote control".
- Bibi, can you not get distracted?

32:14.850 --> 32:16.511
You see, Arnaldi...

32:16.726 --> 32:22.392
my work has one
fundamental precondition: discretion.

32:22.607 --> 32:27.272
And there are too many eyes
watching you right now.

32:27.654 --> 32:29.315
It'll seem like a paradox...

32:29.823 --> 32:33.191
but I only help those
who don't need to be helped.

32:35.245 --> 32:38.829
It's a pleasure to see you again.

32:39.040 --> 32:42.954
And I'm sorry you've come
all this way for nothing.

32:44.588 --> 32:47.421
Now, if you'll excuse me...

32:47.549 --> 32:48.710
Wait.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.917
You know you're risking your life?

32:52.220 --> 32:53.961
Is that a threat?

32:54.181 --> 32:55.842
I don't like this situation.

32:56.224 --> 32:58.215
I found myself in it.

32:58.435 --> 33:00.676
But if I'm risking getting shot

33:01.062 --> 33:05.852
then so will you
and your goddamn discretion.

33:07.194 --> 33:10.562
The silverware isn't ours.
You know whose it is, right'?

33:11.281 --> 33:14.945
You'd better find a way
of moving the silverware

33:15.160 --> 33:19.404
from the burning house
to a safe, isolated house.

33:19.748 --> 33:22.206
Otherwise we'll all get hurt.

33:34.137 --> 33:38.096
GENEVA

33:57.869 --> 33:58.984
It's gone.

34:00.705 --> 34:03.572
There's no account,
it was closed five hours ago.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.876
You let her screw you over.

34:08.088 --> 34:13.003
And I'm here like an idiot!
ls this what the law does?

34:13.426 --> 34:15.463
You and I never met.

34:52.340 --> 34:55.128
Who's that sitting with Dell'Utri?

34:55.760 --> 34:57.797
He's... Leonardo Notte.

34:58.305 --> 35:02.424
A jerk,
Dell'Utri's taken a shine to him...

35:02.809 --> 35:04.891
It's really strange.

35:04.978 --> 35:08.312
I still don't understand
what they do in that office.

35:08.523 --> 35:13.484
They have to help increase business
for the company,

35:13.695 --> 35:15.777
like we're here doing nothing.

35:16.948 --> 35:20.532
He tried to steal my job,
but he failed.

35:22.495 --> 35:25.453
I'll be right back, excuse me.

35:33.923 --> 35:35.914
Excuse me.

35:37.969 --> 35:40.631
Lucio Corradi, assistant director.

35:41.056 --> 35:42.842
A big shot!

35:45.727 --> 35:47.684
I've missed you.

35:51.441 --> 35:55.025
- How's Viola?
- Fine.

35:55.570 --> 35:57.937
I took her back to her mum's.

35:58.156 --> 36:00.443
You do that with all the girls.

36:01.242 --> 36:03.984
As soon as you feel anything,
you send them away.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.242
I didn't send you away.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.158
I fell in love with you.

36:12.796 --> 36:15.037
Or I was about to.

36:17.425 --> 36:20.213
Are you speechless for once?

36:24.849 --> 36:28.262
You know why beavers build dams?

36:29.104 --> 36:32.017
Here we go... this is the Leo I know.

36:32.899 --> 36:36.358
Because their teeth
never stop growing.

36:36.569 --> 36:39.152
So they chew on wood
to keep them short.

36:40.115 --> 36:42.447
Are you comparing me to a beaver?

36:45.078 --> 36:47.661
I wanted to take you with me
that night with Lucidi.

36:48.206 --> 36:50.447
But then what would've happened?

36:50.875 --> 36:55.210
It would've been nice for a while.
We'd have been happy, perhaps.

36:56.589 --> 37:01.049
Then you'd have started chewing
on wood, it's in your nature.

37:01.469 --> 37:03.756
We'll never know that.

37:08.017 --> 37:10.054
Thanks to you.

37:16.025 --> 37:18.312
Good evening,
like all evenings it's evening,

37:18.528 --> 37:20.610
so this evening too I'll say:

37:20.780 --> 37:22.942
good evening!

37:33.835 --> 37:36.247
Tonight my role is an unusual one,

37:36.421 --> 37:38.412
it's not very special, but substantial.

37:38.757 --> 37:41.465
My role tonight is that of a goat.

37:41.676 --> 37:44.293
You'll be thinking: why a goat?

37:44.512 --> 37:46.844
Allow me to explain.

37:47.348 --> 37:52.013
Before an important race,
what do they put next to racehorses?

37:52.187 --> 37:56.021
They put goats with them,
because they're meek animals,

37:56.232 --> 37:59.566
animals that keep
thoroughbreds calm.

37:59.652 --> 38:04.021
They make them feel powerful
and at that same time advise them.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.652
So: I'm the goat

38:07.035 --> 38:09.242
but who is the thoroughbred?

38:09.454 --> 38:12.822
You all know him and you'll all want
to call him with me

38:13.041 --> 38:14.623
because he is:

38:14.834 --> 38:18.247
Silvio Berlusconi!

38:18.421 --> 38:19.411
Here he is!

38:20.632 --> 38:23.044
Our president!

38:28.139 --> 38:30.301
Hello, Silvio.

38:38.358 --> 38:42.317
My friends,
some say there's a recession,

38:42.403 --> 38:44.485
but it's just an alibi.

38:44.572 --> 38:46.859
The future is bright,
if we can imagine it so.

38:47.075 --> 38:50.784
If we have faith
in the direction of our dreams.

38:50.995 --> 38:54.829
If we're still here it's because
we haven't stopped moving forwards

38:55.041 --> 38:59.877
and Italy must regain faith in itself
and get back on its feet.

39:00.547 --> 39:02.834
It's time to help Italy rise again,

39:03.049 --> 39:07.418
it's time for us all to say:
Go Italy!

39:07.637 --> 39:11.505
Because now more than ever our fate
is tied to that of our country...

39:32.078 --> 39:34.615
Did you read about
the UFO sightings in Romagna?

39:36.165 --> 39:39.157
There's always someone
who sees a UFO somewhere.

39:40.378 --> 39:41.789
Right.

39:43.172 --> 39:45.334
The newspapers talk about it...

39:45.925 --> 39:50.510
and in the meantime we get used
to the idea that aliens will come.

39:52.807 --> 39:55.139
Stop talking in metaphors, Leo.

39:56.352 --> 40:00.437
I have the feeling that what
we've witnessed tonight

40:00.648 --> 40:02.639
is a sighting.

40:14.120 --> 40:15.736
Hello?

40:19.751 --> 40:21.333
Where are you?

40:26.966 --> 40:30.550
I told him about you,
he said he wants to meet you.

40:30.762 --> 40:34.426
- What should I call him?
- Silvio will be fine, don't worry.

40:34.641 --> 40:36.598
Wait a moment.

40:51.199 --> 40:53.236
Well, are you ready?

40:54.535 --> 40:56.196
Let's go.

41:01.918 --> 41:04.000
Veronica, come on, let's go!

41:18.768 --> 41:20.258
I'll take you home.

41:21.020 --> 41:24.229
What makes you think I'll come?

41:27.652 --> 41:29.518
Are you game?

41:30.238 --> 41:34.027
- Game for what?
- A position has come up...

41:34.409 --> 41:38.027
as a co-presenter
on a TV game show.

41:38.246 --> 41:40.032
On Rai 1.

41:41.290 --> 41:42.906
What?

41:44.293 --> 41:46.625
I'm taking care of you.

42:10.945 --> 42:13.027
- Let's go home.
- Wait a minute.

42:13.239 --> 42:15.355
- What?
- Let me just talk to this guy.

42:15.450 --> 42:17.441
Come here, forget about him.

42:17.660 --> 42:20.948
- What are you staring at?
- He was just an assistant director.

42:23.332 --> 42:27.417
- Let's go.
- No, let's make a film-style exit!

42:28.337 --> 42:30.624
Out of the way, penguins!

42:32.592 --> 42:33.753
Hey...

42:35.887 --> 42:37.343
I-Hi.

42:37.805 --> 42:39.637
How did you know I was here?

42:39.849 --> 42:44.389
Today, in the hall, it was like being
in a Magritte painting.

42:44.479 --> 42:48.689
Then the concierge told me
about the Publitalia convention.

42:49.901 --> 42:53.360
- You look different.
- I'm sober.

42:54.155 --> 42:55.987
Let's change that.

43:09.420 --> 43:11.536
I read that you took
your father's place.

43:11.839 --> 43:14.126
It's also thanks to you.

43:14.592 --> 43:16.833
I just saved your life.

43:17.053 --> 43:21.422
Now you can kill someone,
so you'll even out your karma.

43:21.641 --> 43:26.431
- Why are you in Montecarlo?
- I'm discovering my dark side.

43:26.646 --> 43:30.105
- How's that going?
- I don't know.

43:30.233 --> 43:36.024
Today, for the first time,
I thought I knew what to do.

43:37.198 --> 43:39.189
But I won't be able to sleep tonight.

43:39.283 --> 43:41.490
We'll sleep when we're old.

43:44.914 --> 43:48.032
- What?
- The champagne.

44:35.047 --> 44:36.754
Come in, come on!

44:37.466 --> 44:39.503
In a while.

44:59.989 --> 45:02.071
I told you you'd smoke.

45:37.276 --> 45:38.858
Zeno?

45:44.242 --> 45:45.824
Zeno?

45:54.460 --> 45:57.248
I didn't end up in a cement pillar.

46:00.216 --> 46:03.425
Your friend Brancato
paid me a visit.

46:05.054 --> 46:07.421
But in the end
he let me off the hook.

46:07.640 --> 46:09.847
He's not my friend.

46:11.519 --> 46:13.510
Now I get it.

46:13.729 --> 46:15.436
What?

46:16.023 --> 46:17.684
Switzerland...

46:19.443 --> 46:23.732
those banks that were all the same,
the friendly staff.

46:24.740 --> 46:26.981
I kept on signing
without understanding.

46:27.201 --> 46:29.613
Zeno Mainaghi, Zeno Mainaghi...

46:30.037 --> 46:31.778
Zeno Mainaghi.

46:32.039 --> 46:34.622
Until my name meant nothing.

46:37.420 --> 46:39.536
Then, on the way back,
Dad asked me to drive.

46:40.256 --> 46:43.044
He always wanted to drive
but that time he asked me

46:43.259 --> 46:46.217
and then we said nothing,
all the way to Milan.

46:48.139 --> 46:50.847
When we got home
I found the courage

46:51.058 --> 46:53.641
to ask him what I'd signed.

46:55.229 --> 46:57.846
We were there, by the gate.

46:58.441 --> 47:00.432
And you know what he did?

47:05.072 --> 47:07.029
He started crying.

47:08.367 --> 47:10.358
Can you imagine Dad crying?

47:14.707 --> 47:16.197
Bibi...

47:20.046 --> 47:22.629
If someone like him
was scared to death...

47:24.258 --> 47:26.625
what are we going to do?

47:27.762 --> 47:29.628
Don't worry.

47:30.639 --> 47:32.846
Everything will be fine now.

47:41.067 --> 47:46.779
"In the inquiry led by Di Pietro there are
some aspects which remain unclear.

47:47.156 --> 47:50.649
Reports relating to
and connected to the inquiry

47:50.743 --> 47:52.859
which are anything
but clear or convincing...

47:52.953 --> 47:53.943
AUGUST 23rd

47:54.038 --> 47:55.028
Again?

47:55.122 --> 47:57.784
"It may even be that Di Pietro

47:57.875 --> 48:00.412
is not the hero we think he is

48:00.628 --> 48:03.416
and that
not all that glitters is gold...

48:03.839 --> 48:05.750
The Beast must be furious.

48:05.966 --> 48:07.752
God help this reporter.

48:15.935 --> 48:17.972
Everyone out.

48:22.441 --> 48:24.023
Pastore, not you.

48:30.574 --> 48:33.111
This article was written by Craxi.

48:34.453 --> 48:37.195
A friend of mine was offered money
to say I'm on drugs.

48:37.540 --> 48:41.204
Soon they'll be shooting shit at me
with a power fan.

48:41.419 --> 48:43.535
But you have nothing to hide.

48:44.130 --> 48:45.666
Right.

48:46.882 --> 48:49.624
What about you, Pastore?

48:52.054 --> 48:55.422
I got a letter from Attorney Arnaldi.

48:56.642 --> 49:01.432
Why the hell did you go to Switzerland
with Zeno Mainaghi?

49:05.860 --> 49:08.443
Why the hell did you go?

49:08.654 --> 49:10.645
Slush funds.

49:10.823 --> 49:13.315
- And where are they?
- They've disappeared.

49:13.534 --> 49:16.242
- Beatrice Mainaghi moved them.
- Great timing.

49:16.454 --> 49:18.991
She knew we'd look for them,
she worked fast.

49:19.081 --> 49:20.697
She knew...

49:21.750 --> 49:23.661
Who told her?

49:31.844 --> 49:34.176
I had an affair with her.

49:36.432 --> 49:38.639
But it's over.

49:40.603 --> 49:42.344
Fuck you, Pastore.

49:43.731 --> 49:45.768
I don't give a shit
about your love affairs.

49:45.858 --> 49:48.566
The whole world's against me,
I need men I can count on.

49:48.652 --> 49:51.610
And you ruin my inquiry!
You know how hard I worked?

49:51.739 --> 49:54.447
- Sorry.
- Sorry my ass!

49:56.243 --> 49:58.234
Pastore, you're out.

49:59.246 --> 50:01.408
- What?
- Get out.

50:04.043 --> 50:05.408
Get out!

50:17.765 --> 50:19.927
Dickhead.

50:35.199 --> 50:35.939
NEXT TIME

50:36.033 --> 50:37.239
I don't do that shit.

50:44.083 --> 50:45.494
Why the hell are you here?

50:49.672 --> 50:51.629
It's your fault.

50:51.715 --> 50:54.252
I've been blamed
for too many things recently.
