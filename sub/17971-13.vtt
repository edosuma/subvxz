00:33.433 --> 00:36.635
Ah, Stoolfest.
A magical time of year

00:36.637 --> 00:39.938
when hobos and drug addicts
are made up as clowns

00:39.940 --> 00:42.741
and put in charge
of dangerous rides.

00:42.743 --> 00:45.577
(people screaming)

00:46.913 --> 00:48.280
Huh. "Farmer."

00:48.282 --> 00:50.783
Can you believe
that's still a job?

00:50.785 --> 00:52.551
(all laugh)

00:54.287 --> 00:56.255
Yeah! Whoo!

00:56.257 --> 00:58.857
Teacups! AC/DC!

00:58.859 --> 01:01.160
Rather see some D-cups.

01:01.162 --> 01:01.894
Or C-cups.

01:01.896 --> 01:04.830
Hell, I don't even mind B-cups
if they're real.

01:04.832 --> 01:07.466
I don't want no nippy
little A-cups, though.

01:07.468 --> 01:10.702
Well, we failed
to bond, yet again.

01:10.704 --> 01:12.538
I'm gonna go
to the arcade.

01:12.540 --> 01:13.772
Here, here's ten bucks.

01:13.774 --> 01:16.675
Enjoy yourself.
Don't get kidnapped.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.110
(cell phone rings)

01:18.112 --> 01:19.545
Holler.

01:19.547 --> 01:20.646
Cleve-bro. Holt.

01:20.648 --> 01:22.247
Hey, get over here.

01:22.249 --> 01:23.449
Not going to be able to make it.

01:23.451 --> 01:24.783
What?! You've been talking

01:24.785 --> 01:26.218
about Stoolfest for weeks.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.286
Where are you?

01:27.288 --> 01:28.954
Crosswinds Outlet with my mom.

01:28.956 --> 01:29.788
Sucks.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.224
Holt, can you see
through this skirt?

01:32.226 --> 01:33.325
Ugh! Oh, God!

01:33.327 --> 01:35.194
Sounds like you got
your hands full.

01:35.196 --> 01:35.961
Look, man, I got to go.

01:35.963 --> 01:38.664
Night Ranger's
playing a free concert.

01:38.666 --> 01:39.965
Ranger's there?!

01:39.967 --> 01:41.433
Aw, son of a bitch!

01:41.435 --> 01:42.034
That's it.

01:42.036 --> 01:43.902
We're not going
to Van Heusen.

01:43.904 --> 01:46.638
Mom, you know I need shirts.

01:50.410 --> 01:51.276
What's this?

01:51.278 --> 01:53.245
"Hit three shots, win a fish"?

01:53.247 --> 01:55.614
I could use a fish.

01:56.382 --> 01:58.851
(Globetrotter style music plays)

02:02.922 --> 02:05.390
Wha--? Nobody's
ever made all three.

02:05.392 --> 02:06.525
I'm on to you.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.927
Over-inflated
ball, small rim.

02:08.929 --> 02:11.864
But your tricks can't
stop Rallo's game.

02:11.866 --> 02:13.765
Now give me my fish.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.534
Your name is Rockwell.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.236
You are my new best friend.

02:17.238 --> 02:18.003
I love you.

02:18.005 --> 02:20.272
Be out of town tomorrow.

02:20.274 --> 02:22.207
You make me sick.

02:25.578 --> 02:27.079
Rockwell, sit.

02:27.081 --> 02:30.649
Stay here while I fill
your new home with water.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.351
Ow! Ow!
Stop the fight!

02:32.353 --> 02:34.820
You're going to cause
lasting brain damage.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.755
(screams)

02:36.757 --> 02:38.357
(tires screeching)

02:41.494 --> 02:42.928
Junior, no!

02:42.930 --> 02:44.930
(screams)

02:44.932 --> 02:45.597
(gulps)

02:45.599 --> 02:48.534
You drank my fish!
You drank my fish!

02:48.536 --> 02:52.371
I warned you not to put things
in his eating radius.

02:52.373 --> 02:52.871
Did you chew him?

02:52.873 --> 02:54.940
No, that hypnotist
conditioned me

02:54.942 --> 02:56.775
not to chew
when I drink anymore.

02:56.777 --> 02:59.211
Well, then maybe he's
living inside you.

02:59.213 --> 03:00.078
Like a baby?

03:00.080 --> 03:04.383
Yeah. Except this baby's
gonna be born out the back.

03:04.385 --> 03:07.119
I heard that's how
Danny Bonaduce was born.

03:07.121 --> 03:09.521
(laughs)
Out the butt.

03:11.090 --> 03:13.025
I can't believe
I missed Stoolfest

03:13.027 --> 03:14.426
because of
my stupid mom.

03:14.428 --> 03:16.762
Ha! You're whipped
by your mom.

03:16.764 --> 03:17.796
(imitates whip cracking)

03:17.798 --> 03:19.031
(Cleveland and Lester join in)

03:19.033 --> 03:22.334
(all laughing)

03:22.336 --> 03:22.734
Shut up!

03:22.736 --> 03:25.270
I call the shots
in our relationship.

03:25.272 --> 03:25.704
Horse puckey!

03:25.706 --> 03:28.874
Then how come your mom never
lets you come to poker night?

03:28.876 --> 03:31.510
It starts at 9:00.
That's late.

03:31.512 --> 03:33.845
Holt, maybe it's not
my place, but...

03:33.847 --> 03:35.414
you can't live
like this.

03:35.416 --> 03:38.016
What the hell am I supposed
to do? She's my mom.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.985
You're a big short man.

03:39.987 --> 03:40.752
Man up! Talk to her.

03:40.754 --> 03:44.122
Lay down the law and let her
know you're not a boy anymore.

03:44.124 --> 03:46.391
You're right,
Cleveland.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.059
I'm a man.

03:47.061 --> 03:48.026
I'm going to tell my mommy

03:48.028 --> 03:51.463
she can't mess
with Holt Anne Richter.

03:55.435 --> 03:57.703
(both laughing)

03:57.705 --> 03:58.737
Dutch oven!

03:58.739 --> 03:59.905
Aah! Let me out!

03:59.907 --> 04:01.540
(chuckles)
Just kidding.

04:01.542 --> 04:02.975
The Dutch don't
cook their food

04:02.977 --> 04:04.977
by trapping farts
in a blanket...

04:04.979 --> 04:05.510
I don't think.

04:05.512 --> 04:09.081
I mean, they couldn't possibly
do that, could they?

04:09.083 --> 04:11.250
(glass shattering)
What's that?

04:12.919 --> 04:14.920
(shouting indistinctly)

04:14.922 --> 04:15.754
It's Holt.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.990
He's all worked up
like Ian McKellen

04:17.992 --> 04:20.025
at a high school
wrestling match.

04:20.027 --> 04:20.659
Oh, yeah.

04:20.661 --> 04:23.095
I convinced him
to set his mom straight.

04:23.097 --> 04:23.729
HOLT:
We're done!

04:23.731 --> 04:25.797
(glass shattering)
You're not the
boss of me!

04:25.799 --> 04:28.700
Oh, my God. Cleveland,
come look at this.

04:28.702 --> 04:31.803
Now, how you get
a pimple on your thigh?

04:31.805 --> 04:33.138
(sobbing):
I'm sorry.

04:33.140 --> 04:36.508
I'll always love you.

04:36.510 --> 04:37.809
(grunting)

04:37.811 --> 04:39.645
Cleveland,
he's killing his mother.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.413
(with accent):
Oh, that's so crazy.

04:41.415 --> 04:42.914
Let me take a look, huh?

04:42.916 --> 04:45.350
(grunting)

05:01.968 --> 05:03.368
(tires screeching)

05:03.370 --> 05:04.269
Huh. That is odd.

05:04.271 --> 05:07.139
It's more than
odd, Cleveland.

05:07.141 --> 05:09.041
It's murder!

05:09.909 --> 05:13.779
LIONEL STANDER:
Hart to Hart
<i>will return in a moment.</i>

05:18.051 --> 05:20.218
Do you still think Holt
murdered his mother,

05:20.220 --> 05:22.654
or are you looking
for my breakfast out there?

05:22.656 --> 05:24.089
'Cause it sure ain't
in the kitchen.

05:24.091 --> 05:27.159
Joke all you want, but I
watch all three <i>CSIs--</i>

05:27.161 --> 05:28.660
Miami, New York
and regular--

05:28.662 --> 05:31.596
and I'm telling you,
this was an inside job.

05:31.598 --> 05:33.165
What's gotten into you?

05:33.167 --> 05:34.733
I have a desk job, Cleveland.

05:34.735 --> 05:35.767
All I do, every day,

05:35.769 --> 05:38.503
is watch crime shows on Hulu
and read mysteries.

05:38.505 --> 05:41.306
That's all anyone
with a desk job does.

05:41.308 --> 05:42.140
If it makes you
feel better,

05:42.142 --> 05:44.676
I'll go down to the Stool,
get shellacked,

05:44.678 --> 05:46.745
and ask Holt
if he murdered his mom.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.280
No! Don't
just ask him.

05:48.282 --> 05:51.149
Be subtle, like
Garrison Keillor.

05:51.151 --> 05:52.951
And then, Mrs. Clarington

05:52.953 --> 05:55.387
called us back
from the fishing hole

05:55.389 --> 06:00.892
to offer us a slice
of her famous rhubarb cobbler.

06:00.894 --> 06:01.893
(laughter)

06:01.895 --> 06:06.298
I've never hated
white people more.

06:07.967 --> 06:11.603
So, anyone do anything
interesting last night

06:11.605 --> 06:14.740
from 11:37
to 11:45 p.m.?

06:14.742 --> 06:17.976
Oh, I was just... I was just,
uh, wearing a mud mask,

06:17.978 --> 06:19.711
writing down
what I'm grateful for.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.914
Listened to A.M. radio and
yanked it on the nines.

06:22.916 --> 06:23.448
Nice.

06:23.450 --> 06:26.418
Yeah, I took care
of some business myself.

06:26.420 --> 06:27.285
(grunts)

06:27.287 --> 06:29.321
Interesting.
(grunts)

06:29.323 --> 06:30.856
I talked to my mom,
like you said,

06:30.858 --> 06:33.191
and she went away
for a while.

06:33.193 --> 06:34.459
What do you mean, "went away"?

06:34.461 --> 06:36.928
Let's just say
you set me straight yesterday.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.830
Made me realize
what I needed to do.

06:38.832 --> 06:42.300
And now I'm a free man,
thanks to you.

06:42.302 --> 06:45.137
(laughing)

06:49.909 --> 06:51.743
Time to feed our baby.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.311
Open up.

06:55.314 --> 06:56.715
I'm still hungry.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.617
It says you only
get one pinch.

06:58.619 --> 07:01.753
I know, but I'm
eating for two.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.088
Sold.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.289
(chuckles)

07:04.291 --> 07:06.091
I think I feel him kicking.

07:06.093 --> 07:06.792
(sighs)

07:06.794 --> 07:12.164
I've never seen you look
so beautiful, Cleveland Jr.

07:12.166 --> 07:14.399
You're glowing.

07:15.868 --> 07:17.202
(radio static)

07:17.204 --> 07:19.571
Now, don't forget-- you
have to get him to confess

07:19.573 --> 07:21.006
and lead you
to the body.

07:21.008 --> 07:22.474
We'll follow
closely behind.

07:22.476 --> 07:24.309
Holt will be okay
in prison, right?

07:24.311 --> 07:27.212
A petite, boyish fitness nut
with a crotch-high head?

07:27.214 --> 07:29.781
Oh, yeah, he'll be
the most popular guy in there.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.317
He gon' get tore up, isn't he?

07:32.319 --> 07:34.719
Listen, we need to talk.

07:34.721 --> 07:37.255
Holt, I saw everything.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.792
The body, the carpet,
the car ride.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.527
What was I
supposed to do?

07:42.529 --> 07:43.528
I was desperate.

07:43.530 --> 07:45.297
I know it was wrong.

07:45.299 --> 07:46.064
(crying)

07:46.066 --> 07:48.667
I buried her near
the north bank of the river.

07:48.669 --> 07:49.701
Take me there.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.036
In your red Crossfire,

07:51.038 --> 07:55.640
with the "McCain/Palin"
sticker on the back window.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.429
(crickets chirping)

08:21.167 --> 08:22.501
She's over here.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.870
I want you
to know I'm sorry.

08:24.872 --> 08:25.604
For what?

08:25.606 --> 08:28.039
For this.
She's here!

08:28.041 --> 08:30.275
The body's here,
over here!

08:30.277 --> 08:32.777
(siren wailing,
indistinct yelling)

08:34.914 --> 08:36.915
(guns cocking)
What the hell?

08:37.550 --> 08:38.984
(grunting)

08:38.986 --> 08:41.353
Dog pile!

08:43.489 --> 08:45.123
I'm sorry, Holt,

08:45.125 --> 08:47.792
but you have to pay
for what you did.

08:47.794 --> 08:52.364
Thou doth be judgeth
by he who bringeth ambrosia

08:52.366 --> 08:56.902
to the shores of Galilee,
lest ye removeth the plank

08:56.904 --> 09:01.273
from thine eternal Bounty,
the quicker picker-upper.

09:01.275 --> 09:06.111
Or Brawny, whose tag line
I do notteth remember.

09:06.113 --> 09:10.515
But I do recollecteth
a lumberjack on the wrapper.

09:10.517 --> 09:14.352
You're going to jail.

09:14.987 --> 09:16.321
I got something.

09:16.323 --> 09:20.125
No, no, no, no, no, this is bad,
this is bad, this is bad.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.095
Wait a sec.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.131
That's not your mom.

09:27.366 --> 09:28.400
It's a sex doll.

09:28.402 --> 09:30.268
Repeat: just a sex doll.

09:30.270 --> 09:33.505
Repeat again:
a doll for sex.

09:33.507 --> 09:34.506
So, move on in.

09:34.508 --> 09:36.508
Something to see here,
people.

09:36.510 --> 09:37.976
Something to see.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.210
(camera clicks)
MAN:
T-shirts!

09:39.212 --> 09:44.583
Get your "Holt Richter
has sex with dolls" T-shirts!

09:44.585 --> 09:47.118
(groans)

09:49.121 --> 09:50.622
I'm sorry, Holt.

09:50.624 --> 09:51.990
It's not your fault.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.892
I'm going to tell you
something right now

09:53.894 --> 09:55.560
that I've never
told anybody.

09:55.562 --> 09:58.997
I've never actually
had a girlfriend.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.465
Really.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.367
Oh, really?

10:02.369 --> 10:05.370
When I bought Kimmy,
it started out as a joke.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.939
You know, a $7,000 joke.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.174
Why'd you bury Kimmy?

10:09.176 --> 10:10.275
I thought about
what you said.

10:10.277 --> 10:13.111
I stood up to my mom and
sent her on a vacation,

10:13.113 --> 10:13.945
which gave me time to realize

10:13.947 --> 10:15.680
my relationship
with Kimmy wasn't healthy.

10:15.682 --> 10:17.983
So we had a good-bye three-way
with a beanbag chair,

10:17.985 --> 10:20.619
then I pretended to choke her
to death, rolled her in a rug

10:20.621 --> 10:22.120
and gave her a proper burial

10:22.122 --> 10:24.656
in a hastily dug shallow grave
down by the river.

10:24.658 --> 10:25.457
That's cool.

10:25.459 --> 10:28.259
Well, that's the last
I'll know of love.

10:28.261 --> 10:30.695
Hey, least you
had a taste.

10:30.697 --> 10:32.130
Tell you what
I'm gonna do, Holt.

10:32.132 --> 10:36.167
First thing tomorrow,
I'm gonna find a girl for you.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.535
A live one.

10:37.537 --> 10:38.503
A cute one.

10:38.505 --> 10:41.439
One who could clean herself
when you're done.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.174
Unless she had no arms.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.343
I'll try to find you one
with arms.

10:45.345 --> 10:50.548
You have my word I'll try
to find you one with arms.

10:55.287 --> 10:58.423
So, I figured you could help
me find a date for Holt.

10:58.425 --> 11:01.192
I haven't nailed
that new chick yet.

11:05.531 --> 11:07.599
Hi. I'm Cleveland.

11:07.601 --> 11:09.000
I'm Jane.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.035
Pleasure.

11:10.037 --> 11:11.569
Are all these cats yours?

11:11.571 --> 11:14.305
I wish.
(chuckles nervously)

11:14.307 --> 11:14.706
Neat.

11:14.708 --> 11:18.076
I think the pictures of the cats
answer this question,

11:18.078 --> 11:19.611
but are you single?

11:19.613 --> 11:20.045
(sighs)

11:20.047 --> 11:22.380
I'm just trying to learn
who I am without a man.

11:22.382 --> 11:25.750
But I think I might be able
to do that better with a man.

11:25.752 --> 11:28.219
You know leap year Virgos.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.455
(laughs)
Bingo.

11:30.457 --> 11:33.558
Janey, I have a date for you.

11:35.027 --> 11:35.560
(speed dials)

11:35.562 --> 11:37.328
(phone rings,
answering machine beeps)

11:37.330 --> 11:39.197
JANE:
Hi, guys. It's me.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.932
Sorry to interrupt
<i>Guiding Light.</i>

11:40.934 --> 11:43.068
Just wanted to share
the good news.

11:43.070 --> 11:43.668
We've got a date.

11:43.670 --> 11:46.071
He's a friend of a friend
of a guy I work with and he...

11:46.073 --> 11:47.906
(machine beeps off)

11:51.043 --> 11:52.010
Still nothing?

11:52.012 --> 11:53.378
It's been days, man.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.614
I wish you would have to
carry him for just one day

11:56.616 --> 11:58.683
so you would know
how it feels.

11:58.685 --> 12:00.151
I'm doing what I can.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.020
You know how many 7-Elevens
I had to go to

12:02.022 --> 12:05.690
to find those stupid grape jelly
Pop Tarts you were craving?

12:05.692 --> 12:08.393
Oh, so you're saying I'm fat?

12:08.395 --> 12:09.661
(sobbing)

12:09.663 --> 12:10.328
(groans)

12:10.330 --> 12:12.163
I can't say anything.

12:12.165 --> 12:13.932
I'm taking a walk.

12:13.934 --> 12:17.168
I wish you never even
swallowed my fish.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.537
(continues sobbing)

12:19.539 --> 12:22.140
I'm glad
you swallowed the fish.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.541
I love you.

12:23.543 --> 12:26.411
(grunts softly)

12:27.713 --> 12:29.481
I had chicken
pox as an adult.

12:29.483 --> 12:31.116
Almost died.
Didn't care.

12:31.118 --> 12:33.518
Knocked out <i>Band of</i>
<i>B</i> <i>rotherss</i> in a weekend.

12:33.520 --> 12:34.619
Cool.
(chuckles)

12:34.621 --> 12:37.422
Are you sitting
in a booster seat?

12:37.424 --> 12:38.523
No.
(chuckles)

12:38.525 --> 12:40.692
No-- children sit
in booster seats.

12:40.694 --> 12:42.393
This is called The Executive.

12:42.395 --> 12:43.795
Bought it at Sky Mall.

12:43.797 --> 12:44.763
Same one Bono has.

12:44.765 --> 12:47.098
Oh, my God.
You like music?

12:47.100 --> 12:49.300
I like music, too.

12:49.302 --> 12:50.735
What's your favorite group?

12:50.737 --> 12:52.604
Beatles.
No way.

12:52.606 --> 12:53.271
Me, too.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.140
Have you heard
<i>Abbey Road?</i>

12:55.142 --> 12:56.374
Kicks ass.

12:56.376 --> 12:57.442
Bought it today.

12:57.444 --> 12:58.510
You know what?

12:58.512 --> 12:59.577
If you like
The Beatles,

12:59.579 --> 13:02.213
you will love this band
called Nickelback.

13:02.215 --> 13:03.114
Do you have some?

13:03.116 --> 13:05.583
Only like a whole CD
in my car.

13:05.585 --> 13:07.452
Well, let's go.

13:14.693 --> 13:16.294
I haven't seen Holt
in a week.

13:16.296 --> 13:19.164
Now, I don't want to sound
like a queer or nothing,

13:19.166 --> 13:20.698
but I miss him.

13:20.700 --> 13:21.966
(slurring):
I miss him, too.

13:21.968 --> 13:24.102
(laughs)
Just teasing.

13:24.104 --> 13:27.172
I think he's
fallen in <i>amour.</i>

13:27.174 --> 13:28.306
Thanks to <i>moi.</i>

13:28.308 --> 13:30.775
Cleveland, how many
mimosas have you had?

13:30.777 --> 13:33.311
<i>Quatorze</i> sor <i>quinze.</i>

13:33.313 --> 13:34.679
(car door closes)
Here they come.

13:34.681 --> 13:36.114
(doorbell rings)

13:36.116 --> 13:36.681
Sorry we were late.

13:36.683 --> 13:41.186
We would have been here on time,
but someone's a little jerk.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.220
(chuckles nervously)

13:42.222 --> 13:46.224
Hey, guys, can I take
your coats and sunglasses?

13:46.226 --> 13:47.725
I'm fine.
Come on, Holt.

13:47.727 --> 13:49.727
Only dip-wads like
Jack Nicholson

13:49.729 --> 13:53.898
and the entire rap community
wear sunglasses inside.

13:53.900 --> 13:56.401
I said I'm fine.
(all gasp)

13:56.403 --> 13:58.236
Holt fell on
a pair of binoculars.

13:58.238 --> 14:01.506
Isn't that right, Holt?

14:01.508 --> 14:04.843
I said, isn't that right?!

14:04.845 --> 14:05.844
She's right.

14:05.846 --> 14:06.845
Uh, bird-watching
accident.

14:06.847 --> 14:09.814
That's right--
bird-watching accident.

14:09.816 --> 14:10.982
You like
watching birds?

14:10.984 --> 14:13.685
You like looking at their
little bird weenies?

14:13.687 --> 14:14.953
Yeah, you do, don't you?

14:14.955 --> 14:17.755
You're a weird little
bird queer, Holt.

14:22.695 --> 14:23.661
So, Holt,

14:23.663 --> 14:25.463
we're worried
that you and Jane

14:25.465 --> 14:27.365
might be having
problems.

14:27.367 --> 14:27.799
Problems?

14:27.801 --> 14:31.169
Since when is getting too much
hey-nonny-nonny a problem?

14:31.171 --> 14:31.970
(cell phone vibrates)

14:31.972 --> 14:32.937
Jane's texting me.

14:32.939 --> 14:36.774
I've got 30 seconds to call
her back, or else I get hit--

14:36.776 --> 14:38.743
uh, with evening rates.

14:40.246 --> 14:41.346
I'll tell you
something.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.414
You could travel
all the way to Egypt

14:43.416 --> 14:46.351
and you wouldn't see
"de-Nile" like that.

14:46.353 --> 14:47.585
Shut the (bleep) up, Tim.

14:47.587 --> 14:51.189
I got Holt into this mess,
and I'm gonna get him out of it.

14:51.191 --> 14:52.523
I'm gonna go tell Jane to...

14:52.525 --> 14:56.861
(imitating Tony Montana):
Say good-bye
to my little friend.

14:56.863 --> 14:59.397
God, black guys
love <i>Scarface.</i>

14:59.399 --> 15:02.533
They can-- they cannot
stop talking about it.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.270
(doorbell rings)

15:05.272 --> 15:06.304
Hi, Cleveland.

15:06.306 --> 15:07.405
What are you
doing here?

15:07.407 --> 15:08.506
Now, you listen here.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.909
You're not gonna lay
another finger on Holt.

15:10.911 --> 15:14.879
In fact, you're gonna call him
and tell him it's over.

15:14.881 --> 15:16.848
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

15:16.850 --> 15:18.750
Let's talk more
about this.

15:18.752 --> 15:22.353
But first, I'd like to
give you a sandwich.

15:22.355 --> 15:24.389
Really?
Well, I am a little peckish.

15:24.391 --> 15:27.525
Wait a minute, is this gonna be
a knuckle sand...?

15:27.527 --> 15:28.526
(grunts)
How about a little

15:28.528 --> 15:30.995
Hawaiian Punch to
wash it down with?

15:30.997 --> 15:33.431
Why, I am a little parched.
Wait a min...

15:33.433 --> 15:34.766
(Cleveland grunts)

15:34.768 --> 15:35.533
So, how did it go?

15:35.535 --> 15:37.702
Did she agree to
stay away from Holt?

15:37.704 --> 15:38.903
Does it look like it, Boo-Boo?

15:38.905 --> 15:42.640
And I couldn't even hit her back
'cause she's a girl.

15:42.642 --> 15:43.908
I'll handle this.

15:43.910 --> 15:45.343
You tell her
she still owes me

15:45.345 --> 15:49.580
a sandwich and a glass
of Hawaiian Punch!

15:49.582 --> 15:51.482
(doorbell rings)

15:51.484 --> 15:51.883
Hi, Jane.

15:51.885 --> 15:54.285
You know, according to
Ecclesiastes 12:16...

15:54.287 --> 15:56.220
(grunts)
Ow! My snout!

15:56.222 --> 15:58.456
(doorbell rings, Jane grunts)

15:58.458 --> 16:00.692
(doorbell rings)
Not in the face!

16:00.694 --> 16:02.560
(both grunt)
Not the nads!

16:02.562 --> 16:05.663
(both grunting)

16:05.665 --> 16:10.368
And those are just several of
the rumors about David Geffen.

16:10.370 --> 16:11.336
(pager beeps)

16:11.338 --> 16:12.837
Oh, God! This is it!

16:12.839 --> 16:14.772
This is really happening!

16:16.408 --> 16:17.508
(grunts)

16:19.878 --> 16:22.313
How close are you?
I'm crowning.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.415
Okay, remember
your breathing.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.917
(shallow panting)

16:25.919 --> 16:27.652
Turn that off.

16:27.654 --> 16:28.619
I look awful.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.121
I'm not wearing any makeup.

16:30.123 --> 16:32.390
All right.
You want an Anacin?

16:32.392 --> 16:34.726
No, I want to do it
all natural.

16:34.728 --> 16:36.995
All right,
push, push.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.863
(straining)

16:38.865 --> 16:40.331
Just give me the damn Anacin!

16:40.333 --> 16:41.599
You don't need it!

16:41.601 --> 16:42.767
I do!

16:42.769 --> 16:44.602
One more push.

16:44.604 --> 16:45.937
Big one.

16:45.939 --> 16:48.873
(grunting)

16:48.875 --> 16:50.308
(straining)

16:50.310 --> 16:52.043
(groans)

16:52.045 --> 16:54.946
(sobbing)

16:54.948 --> 16:56.014
You did it, Junior.

16:56.016 --> 16:57.615
<i>We</i> did it, Rallo.

16:57.617 --> 17:00.752
Now, let's have a look
at our little guy.

17:00.754 --> 17:02.387
Oh, boy.

17:02.389 --> 17:03.721
Did he make it?

17:03.723 --> 17:06.057
Uh, this is unclear.

17:06.059 --> 17:08.993
That's an
awful mess.

17:08.995 --> 17:09.727
Yes, it is.

17:09.729 --> 17:14.332
Looks like something you'd eat
if you lived in Louisiana.

17:14.334 --> 17:16.034
Yes, it does.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.468
May I?

17:17.470 --> 17:18.669
You may.

17:18.671 --> 17:19.904
(toilet flushes)

17:19.906 --> 17:22.140
I hate that
it turned out this way.

17:22.142 --> 17:25.343
I'm glad we went
through this together.

17:25.345 --> 17:26.310
Uh-oh!

17:26.312 --> 17:28.513
Here comes the afterbirth!

17:28.515 --> 17:30.014
(screaming)

17:32.618 --> 17:33.918
(knocking on door)

17:33.920 --> 17:36.587
Hi, Cleveland,
sorry about before.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.556
(laughs)
Hope you're okay.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.525
But, then again, you
kind of made me do it.

17:40.527 --> 17:44.395
Anyway, I'm going to have to
borrow Holt from you guys.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.497
(inhales
deeply)

17:46.499 --> 17:47.565
No.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.767
I'm sorry?
I said no.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.002
Not going
with you.

17:51.004 --> 17:52.070
Won't
back down.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.672
Petty. Heartbreakers.
<i>Full Moon Fever.</i>

17:54.674 --> 17:56.474
Holt, I'm going
to count to three,

17:56.476 --> 17:59.844
and if we're not heading out
the door for tapas and Mojitos,

17:59.846 --> 18:03.881
then I am going
to get a little bit upset.

18:03.883 --> 18:05.716
My curios!

18:05.718 --> 18:07.585
Let's go.

18:08.787 --> 18:10.221
(groans)

18:10.223 --> 18:12.557
What the hell is going on
down there?

18:12.559 --> 18:14.492
Sweet corn in the morning!

18:14.494 --> 18:16.494
What happened to you guys?

18:16.496 --> 18:17.829
(all groaning)

18:17.831 --> 18:18.930
It was...

18:18.932 --> 18:20.731
(clears throat)

18:21.066 --> 18:23.167
We tried to get her
to stop hitting Holt,

18:23.169 --> 18:26.604
and she beat the
respective craps out of us.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.673
She beat up
all of you?

18:28.675 --> 18:30.041
Well, what were
we supposed to do?

18:30.043 --> 18:31.809
We can't hit a girl.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.111
Well, I understand.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.879
I'd never hit
a girl, either.

18:34.881 --> 18:37.582
But I will smack the
white off a bitch!

18:37.584 --> 18:40.084
(grunts)
Nobody hurts my man.

18:40.086 --> 18:41.686
(grunts)
