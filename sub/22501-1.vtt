01:04:38.539 --> 01:04:39.742
No.

01:04:40.641 --> 01:04:42.143
Are you telling me the truth?

01:04:45.447 --> 01:04:47.146
You know what.

01:04:47.148 --> 01:04:48.951
- I am gonna out the gun down.
- Yeah.

01:04:50.318 --> 01:04:52.952
If you wanna shoot me
then fucking shoot me.

01:04:52.954 --> 01:04:54.322
I don't care anymore.

01:04:55.623 --> 01:04:57.259
Fuck, I knew it's me.

01:04:57.992 --> 01:04:59.295
Shoot me.

01:05:07.469 --> 01:05:09.269
I am sick of this shit.

01:05:09.271 --> 01:05:12.005
Cut the shit out and let us
fucking outta here, right now.

01:05:12.007 --> 01:05:14.606
I am gonna bash his fucking brain in.

01:05:14.608 --> 01:05:17.045

01:05:19.347 --> 01:05:20.416
Jesus.

What the fuck are you doing?

01:05:23.751 --> 01:05:25.351
The only thing I can.

01:05:25.353 --> 01:05:28.387
And I am not stopping until
you let us the fuck outta here.

01:05:28.389 --> 01:05:30.092
Hold on. Hold on.

01:05:33.327 --> 01:05:35.130

01:05:45.706 --> 01:05:46.909

01:06:21.543 --> 01:06:23.108
Well, son of a bitch,

01:06:23.110 --> 01:06:25.947

This motherfucker's
out of his fucking mind.

01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:29.545
Shit.

01:07:34.048 --> 01:07:35.050
Wait.

01:07:35.817 --> 01:07:37.085
It's gonna be a trap.

01:07:37.518 --> 01:07:38.453
Be careful.

01:07:42.324 --> 01:07:43.358
Looks clear to me.

01:07:46.661 --> 01:07:49.231
No! No!

We're gonna fucking die here.

01:08:54.261 --> 01:08:55.395
Oh fuck!

01:09:00.801 --> 01:09:03.203
Let me the fuck out.

01:09:05.273 --> 01:09:07.443
I played your fucking game.

01:09:09.877 --> 01:09:11.212
[alarm sounding]

01:09:17.618 --> 01:09:19.688
What the fuck is that?

01:09:21.287 --> 01:09:22.557
Ultrasound.

[The Voice] <i>Final test.</i>

01:10:41.703 --> 01:10:43.239
So you just gonna leave her?

01:10:44.506 --> 01:10:46.408
There is nothing we can do to save her.

01:11:03.224 --> 01:11:05.427
It's the only thing we can do.

01:11:15.002 --> 01:11:16.204

You come on here. Oh, oh. Oh, oh yeah.

01:12:50.164 --> 01:12:53.368
Good girl, keep walking. All right!

01:12:55.235 --> 01:12:58.273
Dale here, really will knock you.

01:12:58.872 --> 01:12:59.907
Yeah.

01:13:00.975 --> 01:13:02.311
No, Dale.

01:13:03.310 --> 01:13:05.111
Listen to me, honey.

01:13:05.113 --> 01:13:06.178
Listen.

01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:07.750
I want tell you all...

01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:20.762
Fuck you.

01:13:35.810 --> 01:13:38.280
Fuck. He's dead.

01:13:41.483 --> 01:13:42.748
You won.

01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:44.586
You fucking coward.

01:13:46.119 --> 01:13:48.890
You hide behind all these stupid games.

01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:51.493
Fuck you!

<i>If you do,</i>

01:14:00.068 --> 01:14:01.770
<i>I might just let you live.</i>

01:14:48.917 --> 01:14:50.285
[The Voice] Hello, Amber.

01:14:51.685 --> 01:14:52.585
What do you want?

01:14:52.587 --> 01:14:54.389
[The Voice] I got what I want.

01:14:54.889 --> 01:14:55.824
[gunshot]

01:14:59.027 --> 01:15:00.860
Why are you doing this?

01:15:00.862 --> 01:15:04.362
I made it my mission to teach
those who don't appreciate

01:15:04.364 --> 01:15:07.465
real sacrifice, what it truly means.

01:15:07.467 --> 01:15:10.268
That is why I put you through the test.

01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:13.305
Because if I can teach just one person,

01:15:13.307 --> 01:15:15.107
then I've made a difference.

01:15:15.109 --> 01:15:16.942
But you failed, Amber.

01:15:16.944 --> 01:15:20.211
You made a wrong choice
by coming back here.

01:15:20.213 --> 01:15:21.884
You could've made it out.

01:15:23.618 --> 01:15:25.317
You think you're a genius

01:15:25.319 --> 01:15:27.588
but you're just a fucking head-case.

01:15:28.488 --> 01:15:30.990
I am not here to kill you, Amber.

01:15:30.992 --> 01:15:34.059
You are here to kill me.

01:15:34.061 --> 01:15:37.396
This is your opportunity for vengeance.

01:15:37.398 --> 01:15:40.465
I recognized I've served
my purpose and now,

01:15:40.467 --> 01:15:42.434
it's my time to go.

01:15:42.436 --> 01:15:44.669
However, because you failed,

01:15:44.671 --> 01:15:47.375
it will be at the cost of your life.

01:15:48.408 --> 01:15:50.910
If you do not kill me in one minute,

01:15:50.912 --> 01:15:52.548
we will both die,

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.349
slowly.

01:15:55.483 --> 01:15:57.650
I guess that's an easy choice.

01:15:57.652 --> 01:16:00.655

usually are the hardest.

01:16:12.033 --> 01:16:13.001
