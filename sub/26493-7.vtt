07:50.360 --> 07:52.579
FOR ONE OF
TWO REASONS.

07:52.580 --> 07:54.366
EITHER BECAUSE
THE CHEATING

07:54.370 --> 07:56.691
WAS A BIG MISTAKE

07:56.700 --> 07:58.247
AND THEY JUST WANT
TO PROTECT THE PERSON

07:58.250 --> 08:00.412
THEY LOVE
FROM BEING HURT...

08:00.420 --> 08:01.819
OR?

08:01.830 --> 08:05.380
OR THEYRE JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT THEMSELVES.

08:05.380 --> 08:07.462
YOU HAVE TO DECIDE
WHICH ONES TRUE FOR YOU

31:12.680 --> 31:14.136
HOW COULD YOU
DO THIS TO ME?

31:14.140 --> 31:16.131
IT DIDNT
MEAN ANYTHING.

31:16.140 --> 31:17.596
I SWEAR, OK?

31:17.600 --> 31:19.261
THATS WHY I DIDNT
WANT TO TELL YOU.

31:19.270 --> 31:21.568
I DIDNT WANT TO HURT
YOU OVER A MISTAKE.

31:21.570 --> 31:24.733
YOU LET ME POUR
MY HEART OUT TO YOU.

31:24.740 --> 31:27.152
YOU GAVE ME ADVICE
KNOWING YOUD BETRAYED ME.

31:27.160 --> 31:30.061
I DIDNT WANT TO GIVE YOU
ADVICE. YOU BEGGED ME.

31:30.070 --> 31:32.983
BECAUSE I THOUGHT I WAS
TALKING TO MY BEST FRIEND,

31:32.990 --> 31:35.038
NOT A TREACHEROUS BITCH.

31:37.290 --> 31:38.530
WOW.

31:42.170 --> 31:44.912
YOU ARE SUCH
A HYPOCRITE.

31:44.920 --> 31:46.331
CORRECT ME

31:46.340 --> 31:47.671
YOU MESSED AROUND

31:47.680 --> 31:49.136
KNOWING HOW I FELT
ABOUT HIM,

31:49.140 --> 31:50.505
KNOWING THAT
YOU HAD A BOYFRIEND.

31:50.510 --> 31:51.671
ITS NOT THE SAME.

31:51.680 --> 31:53.762
NO, YOURE RIGHT.

31:53.770 --> 31:54.885
I WAS MESSED UP
ON DRUGS

31:54.890 --> 31:56.096
WHEN I SLEPT
WITH ASHER.

31:56.100 --> 31:58.478
WHATS YOUR EXCUSE?

31:58.480 --> 32:00.187

32:35.600 --> 32:36.840

32:49.490 --> 32:50.901

32:53.280 --> 32:55.988
WAS ANYBODY ELSE FROM

32:55.990 --> 32:59.540
NO. IT--IT WAS
JUST ME.

33:05.250 --> 33:08.049
YOU LEAVE ME
NO CHOICE.

33:08.050 --> 33:10.212
IM SUSPENDING YOU
FOR THE NEXT TWO GAMES.

33:11.430 --> 33:13.387
NO. COACH, PLEASE.

33:13.390 --> 33:15.256
T-TOMORROWS
HOMECOMING.

33:15.260 --> 33:16.671
SCOUTS ARE GONNA BE
AT THAT GAME.

33:16.680 --> 33:18.808
I HAVE TO PLAY. PLEASE
DO NOT DO THIS TO ME.

33:18.810 --> 33:21.302
UNFORTUNATELY, SON,

33:21.310 --> 33:22.971
YOU DID THIS
TO YOURSELF.

33:28.190 --> 33:29.487
COACH.

33:39.580 --> 33:42.868
YO. YOU LATE.

33:42.870 --> 33:44.531

OF IT.

33:44.540 --> 33:46.451
SWIZZ CALLED ME
WHEN SHAWN DIDNT SHOW.

33:46.460 --> 33:47.916
I TOLD HIM I WANTED
HIM HERE.

33:47.920 --> 33:49.376
I TOLD SHAWN THAT
I WOULD HANDLE THIS,

33:49.380 --> 33:51.212
SO THIS IS ON ME.

33:51.220 --> 33:53.211
THERES BEEN A LOT
ON YOU LATELY.

33:53.220 --> 33:54.290
HAVING A GAY CHICK
ROLL WITH US

33:54.300 --> 33:55.631
IS MAKING US LOOK SOFT.

33:55.640 --> 33:56.846
I COULD BE A ASSET.
TRUST ME.

33:56.850 --> 33:58.841
HOW? BECAUSE
AT THIS POINT,

33:58.850 --> 34:01.137
YOU JUST A LIABILITY.

34:01.140 --> 34:03.302
UNLESS YOU READY
TO PROVE OTHERWISE.

34:03.310 --> 34:05.142
PROVE HOW?

34:05.150 --> 34:06.436
TAKE A WALK WITH ME.

34:16.199 --> 34:18.828
<i>THE HELL TM SUPPOSED

34:18.830 --> 34:21.400
SOME CRIPS HANG OUT ON
THE CORNER ON THAT HOUSE.

34:21.409 --> 34:23.742
TAKE YOUR PICK.

34:23.750 --> 34:26.879
TY, I CANT DO THIS.
THATS--THATS NOT ME.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.199
CHICKS SURVIVE

34:28.210 --> 34:29.871
THE BADDEST BITCHES
IN THE STREETS,

34:29.880 --> 34:31.837

34:31.840 --> 34:33.877
AND YOU AINT WILLING

34:33.880 --> 34:36.793
I DONT CARRY NOBODY.

34:36.800 --> 34:38.541
SO YOU AND YOUR
BOY SHAWN,

34:38.550 --> 34:40.052
WATCH YOUR BACK.

34:48.820 --> 34:49.969
<i>1 SWEAR TM NOT NORMALLY
THIS BIG A MESS.</i>

34:49.980 --> 34:51.391
THATS OK, THOUGH.

34:51.400 --> 34:53.482
WHEN YOU GONNA
STOP APOLOGIZING?

34:53.489 --> 34:55.561
PROBABLY SOMETIME
IN 2020.

34:55.570 --> 34:57.117
HEH.

34:59.240 --> 35:01.993
THIS IS SO NOT HOW
I SAW THIS NIGHT GOING.

35:05.540 --> 35:07.247

35:13.590 --> 35:15.126
WHY ARE YOU

35:15.130 --> 35:16.541

35:18.010 --> 35:21.924
I GUESS...

35:29.360 --> 35:30.759
I CANT LEAVE HIM

35:30.770 --> 35:32.147
EVEN AFTER

35:32.150 --> 35:34.357

35:41.120 --> 35:44.158
IM SORRY TO DO THIS.

35:44.160 --> 35:45.457
ITS ALL GOOD.

35:46.790 --> 35:49.828
SO WHEN THE DUST
SETTLES, HOLLA AT ME.

35:49.830 --> 35:51.707
DOESNT MATTER HOW LONG.

35:53.460 --> 35:55.337

36:51.810 --> 36:53.221
COOP: WHATS UP
