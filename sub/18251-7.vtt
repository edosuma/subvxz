00:02.136 --> 00:05.173
(Mixed chatter)

00:05.206 --> 00:07.241
Hey.
Hej.
Hej.

00:07.275 --> 00:10.278
(Speaking in Swedish)

00:15.116 --> 00:18.119
(Giggling)

00:23.124 --> 00:24.325
(Chuckling)

00:26.927 --> 00:31.065
(Laughing)

00:31.099 --> 00:33.567
Hey do you guys
speak any English,
by any chance?

00:33.601 --> 00:35.936
No, nothing?

00:35.969 --> 00:37.871
Listen here,
you little pricks, okay?

00:37.905 --> 00:40.474
I don't need to hear
from you what I hear
from everybody else
every day and I...

00:40.508 --> 00:42.543
Hej, hej...
Hej.

00:42.576 --> 00:45.413
(Chuckling)

00:46.714 --> 00:49.683
(Mixed chatter)

00:49.717 --> 00:52.520
* We're not living in America

00:52.553 --> 00:56.090
* But we're not sorry

00:56.124 --> 00:57.825
* I knew there was something

00:57.858 --> 00:59.893
* That we never had

00:59.927 --> 01:02.930
* We don't worry

01:02.963 --> 01:06.234
* No, we're not
living in America *

01:06.267 --> 01:10.037
* But we're not sorry, no

01:10.070 --> 01:13.474
* We don't care
about the world today *

01:13.507 --> 01:16.244
* We're not sorry

01:16.277 --> 01:17.945
* For you

01:19.413 --> 01:23.551
* For my baby, baby,
baby, baby *

01:23.584 --> 01:24.585
* Aahh

01:26.820 --> 01:29.823
(Speaking in Swedish)

01:31.592 --> 01:34.362
Hey, wow. Look at
these guys, huh, adorable.

01:34.395 --> 01:37.131
Jenny:
Yeah.
(Speaking in Swedish)

01:37.165 --> 01:39.500
Bah, ho! Basketball, right?

01:39.533 --> 01:42.002
Yes! You play?
Yeah, he loves
basketball.

01:42.035 --> 01:43.571
You do? Great,
look at this.

01:43.604 --> 01:46.006
Look what
this guy can do.
Wow, look at that!

01:46.039 --> 01:48.609
Yeah, well,
they don't seem to care.
No. (Chuckling)

01:48.642 --> 01:50.010
Oof!
Yeah, he's impressed.

01:50.043 --> 01:52.246
(Chuckling)
Have you played
basketball?

01:52.280 --> 01:54.047
Yeah, I played
a little bit, yeah.
Actually,

01:54.081 --> 01:56.950
I'm in charge
of the team and we're
looking for a new coach.

01:56.984 --> 01:58.352
Oh.
You want to
coach them?

01:58.386 --> 02:00.788
Yeah, that's a good idea,
you should do that.

02:00.821 --> 02:03.023
Hey.
I...would love to,
but... Hi.

02:03.056 --> 02:05.693
We're trying
to recruit Bruce
as the kids' new
basketball trainer.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.361
Right, but...
That's great.

02:07.395 --> 02:08.929
He's a great
basketball player.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.864
No, I'm pretty good
at basketball...

02:10.898 --> 02:12.433
You're being
too modest now.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.335
I mean, he played
for his college team
and everything.

02:14.368 --> 02:16.069
Yeah, but it was
a small college.

02:16.103 --> 02:19.039
I mean, I'm good for
a small white guy.
(Chuckling)

02:19.072 --> 02:21.108
That's my...
I would love to.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.211
You know, I would love
to do it but I can't.

02:23.244 --> 02:25.112
I got to work, I have
all this work stuff

02:25.145 --> 02:26.880
that's happening
these days and...

02:26.914 --> 02:27.915
What's your job?

02:27.948 --> 02:29.583
My job?
Yeah?

02:29.617 --> 02:32.420
Uh, you know
how there's a guy,
uh, in Rome?

02:32.453 --> 02:36.056
That you pay...
to show you around?

02:36.089 --> 02:38.526
And... maybe cut in
the line at the Vatican?

02:41.829 --> 02:44.064
That.
Hmm...

02:44.097 --> 02:45.966
Like that.

02:45.999 --> 02:49.069
But... but no Vatican.

02:49.102 --> 02:52.240
(Sighing) Well,you
really made it hard
for me to say no
up there.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.908
But you're not all
that busy with the
"guy" thing, are you?

02:54.942 --> 02:56.744
Well it's not
just the "guy"
thing, I mean,

02:56.777 --> 02:59.079
it's all this
wedding stuff,
I have this long
to-do list.

02:59.112 --> 03:00.748
Honey, I'll help you,
okay?

03:00.781 --> 03:03.417
I mean you love basketball,
and you love kids.

03:03.451 --> 03:05.419
Yeah, I love
American kids. Okay?

03:05.453 --> 03:06.820
Not those monsters
up there.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.089
Plus, I don't think
my Swedish is good enough.

03:09.122 --> 03:11.158
I don't even know how
to say, like, "pass
the ball" in Swedish.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.726
"Passa bollen".

03:12.760 --> 03:16.029
What about "time out"?
"Time out".

03:16.063 --> 03:18.466
Dunk?
"Dunk".

03:18.499 --> 03:21.769
Cool, maybe this will be
easier than I thought.
(Wheezing chuckle)

03:21.802 --> 03:24.538
Honey, I'll support you.
Thank you.

03:24.572 --> 03:28.208
I'll come to every game,
I promise.
Sweet.

03:28.242 --> 03:31.679
Did you actually call
those kids "pricks"?

03:31.712 --> 03:33.180
Well, they started it.

03:33.213 --> 03:37.951
(Music)

03:37.985 --> 03:39.687
(Knocking on door)

03:39.720 --> 03:41.755
Why does he want
to see both of us?

03:41.789 --> 03:45.593
No idea.
(Sighing) God.
This is bad.

03:45.626 --> 03:48.028
Maybe we don't need
to be all that specific

03:48.061 --> 03:50.964
about who actually
trashed his office?

03:50.998 --> 03:53.767
You mean, other than me,
who he actually found
in his office?

03:53.801 --> 03:57.738
Emma, I wish it had been
me instead, truly, I do.

03:57.771 --> 04:00.173
And I know a lot
about damage control

04:00.207 --> 04:03.977
and it's best to just...
move on, don't look back.

04:04.011 --> 04:06.614
Hm, you want me
to take the blame.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.716
No one likes
a rat, Emma.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.218
What are we,
the mob now?
All I'm saying,

04:11.251 --> 04:13.220
is that it would be bad
for the bank's image

04:13.253 --> 04:15.255
if both of us were
implicated in this...

04:15.289 --> 04:17.224
Have you heard
the expression,

04:17.257 --> 04:20.694
"What happens at the mohippa,
stays at the mohippa"?

04:20.728 --> 04:25.032
No, can't say I have.
Well, have you heard
"Take one for the team"?

04:25.065 --> 04:26.967
Nope.
How about...

04:27.000 --> 04:29.903
"Please don't mention
my name and destroy
my career."

04:29.937 --> 04:32.139
Please Emma,
sweet, sweet, Emma.

04:32.172 --> 04:35.643
I need this, the same thing
happened at my last job.

04:35.676 --> 04:38.946
You smashed another
fire distinguisher
into a computer?

04:38.979 --> 04:41.549
Pretty much.
Wow.

04:41.582 --> 04:43.484
Okay fine,
I won't say anything.

04:43.517 --> 04:46.153
(Sighing)
Okay, thank you.
But you owe me one.

04:46.186 --> 04:48.322
Of course.
Mm-hmm.

04:48.356 --> 04:51.291
Yes, I thought that we...
maybe can talk a little

04:51.325 --> 04:53.727
about what happened
in my office?
It was Emma.

04:53.761 --> 04:56.864
Hm, yes I know that.
I found her in there.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.932
I'm sorry.
You should be.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.668
Okay, don't push it.

05:00.701 --> 05:03.103
Uh, is there
anything I can do
to make it up to you?

05:03.136 --> 05:06.073
Yes, there should
be some kind of a
punishment, I think.

05:06.106 --> 05:08.141
Yeah, it should.

05:08.175 --> 05:11.979
Maybe, is it possible
to get a regional report
to Hans this week?

05:12.012 --> 05:13.614
Good one.
Well.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.115
Mm-hm, sure.

05:15.148 --> 05:18.752
And HR wants some
overtime statistics

05:18.786 --> 05:20.320
for the marketing
department.

05:20.354 --> 05:23.256
I was going to ask Diane
to do it, but maybe Emma...

05:23.290 --> 05:25.526
Yes, Emma should
do that too.
Okay.

05:25.559 --> 05:28.829
And maybe, maybe,
you can water my plants.

05:28.862 --> 05:31.264
You know what,
I don't think that's
in my job description.

05:31.298 --> 05:32.833
No, but on
the other hand,

05:32.866 --> 05:34.735
it's not part of
my job description

05:34.768 --> 05:39.440
to wash a Hitler mustache
off my family's portrait.

05:39.473 --> 05:41.509
I'll water your plants.
Is that all?

05:41.542 --> 05:44.478
For the moment, yes.
Thank you, Olof,
for understanding,

05:44.512 --> 05:47.848
Emma is very, very
sorry about all of this.

05:51.118 --> 05:52.953
He bought it,
nice work, Emma!

05:55.589 --> 05:57.391
Okay, my name is Bruce.

05:57.425 --> 05:59.159
(In Swedish)

05:59.192 --> 06:01.962
I would like to start
with some lay-ups.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.831
Okay, we're going to sta...
we're going to do two...

06:03.864 --> 06:06.567
tva, line, line,
linjes, linjes.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.336
Linje, linja...
We're going to do
two lines, okay?

06:09.369 --> 06:11.505
Lay-up is,
you take two steps.

06:11.539 --> 06:14.542
(In Swedish)

06:19.880 --> 06:21.649
Because then
it's over, okay?

06:21.682 --> 06:24.685
(Speaking in Swedish)

06:29.923 --> 06:33.461
Uh... bounce,
is it "bounce-a ballen"?

06:35.496 --> 06:36.830
Oh, "prutta"?

06:38.632 --> 06:41.635
(In Swedish)

06:43.671 --> 06:46.239
Why are you... is it "pruta"?
It feels like it's not.

06:46.273 --> 06:48.275
Children:
Ja. Yes.

06:54.815 --> 06:57.551
Children:
Sorry, Bruce.

06:57.585 --> 06:59.286
Go ahead, Bruce.
Thank you, Karl.

06:59.319 --> 07:01.722
Yeah.
Okay.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.757
(Speaking English
and Swedish)

07:05.392 --> 07:07.628
Two hands, grab the ballen...
(Giggling)

07:07.661 --> 07:08.662
Yeah.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.065
Keep...

07:14.735 --> 07:17.104
(Wheezing)
Hey, which part was funny?

07:22.610 --> 07:25.613
(Speaking in Swedish)

08:12.259 --> 08:15.262
(Speaking in Swedish)

08:48.095 --> 08:51.098
(Speaking in Swedish)

09:33.506 --> 09:35.042
(Cheering)

09:35.075 --> 09:37.611
Bruce:
In... Oh, my God.

09:37.645 --> 09:39.379
My God, jeez, what are we...

09:39.412 --> 09:42.616
Hey, block, block!
Just give him a,
give him a little...

09:42.650 --> 09:45.986
Bruce:
(In Swedish)

09:46.019 --> 09:48.055
Nope... Oh God, that's...

09:48.088 --> 09:49.456
(Cheering)

09:49.489 --> 09:54.094
(Speaking in Swedish)

09:54.127 --> 09:56.263
(In English and Swedish)

09:56.296 --> 09:58.198
What is this?
(Shouting)
Go Bruce team!

09:59.700 --> 10:00.801
Move the feet.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.306
(Audience cheering)

10:06.339 --> 10:08.408
Bruce:
What the heck.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.810
Okay defence, up.

10:17.818 --> 10:20.954
(Blowing whistle)
No, come on ref. Ref!

10:20.988 --> 10:23.991
(Speaking in Swedish)

10:29.296 --> 10:31.364
There's been five fouls
called on our team,

10:31.398 --> 10:33.801
not one on the other team.
Okay? What's your problem?

10:33.834 --> 10:35.535
Coach, just leave
the court.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.771
Listen, you know what,
I used to be
a "bajskorv", okay?

10:37.805 --> 10:39.506
So I know how
difficult it is.

10:39.539 --> 10:41.274
And maybe bajskorv
is not your thing.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.877
You know, maybe you
shouldn't be bajskorv,

10:43.911 --> 10:46.113
because you know,
it's hard.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.181
(Blowing whistle)

10:48.215 --> 10:50.818
I give you a technical foul,
please leave the court.

10:50.851 --> 10:53.954
Technical for what?
Stop talking, just leave.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.322
Okay, fine, you know what?
I'm going to leave anyways

10:55.355 --> 10:56.523
because these kids
are useless, okay?

10:56.556 --> 10:59.559
(Speaking in Swedish)

11:00.894 --> 11:03.330
Hey honey, great game.

11:03.363 --> 11:06.099
Great game? We're
getting killed and
I just got thrown
out of it.

11:06.133 --> 11:08.736
Yeah, but apart
from that.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.270
I don't even know if
I can coach these guys.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.205
The language difference
is just too much, I think.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.641
I can help you, dude,
I can be your translator.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.877
Nah...
Sure I can, when do you
practice next time?

11:16.910 --> 11:19.246
Tuesday.
Great,
I'll be there.

11:19.279 --> 11:22.182
And just so you know,
the referee is not
called "bajskorv".

11:22.215 --> 11:25.152
He's called "domarjavel".
Domarjavel?

11:25.185 --> 11:26.720
Oh my god,
that's the problem.

11:29.456 --> 11:30.791
Apologies for
the "bajskorv" thing,

11:30.824 --> 11:32.625
I got misinformation
on that.

11:34.561 --> 11:39.132
(Music)

11:39.166 --> 11:41.234
Okay, let's rehearse.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.136
Bruce, you can
play Britt.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.405
What?
You're American, you know
all the dirty tricks.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.674
It's in your blood. Come.
No.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.409
Yes, you're
very convincing.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.845
You somehow talked Emma
into marrying you.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.046
Get up.
Okay, but you know

11:53.080 --> 11:54.447
I don't even speak
Swedish, so...

11:54.481 --> 11:55.816
Well, we can do it
in English.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.918
Get up!

11:57.951 --> 12:01.721
Now, the meeting room
is packed with people,

12:01.755 --> 12:04.858
then Britt says:

12:04.892 --> 12:07.294
"Next topic,
the apartments in the attic.

12:07.327 --> 12:10.097
Birger Wiik, do you want
to say something?"

12:10.130 --> 12:12.800
"Next topic,
the apartments in the attic,

12:12.833 --> 12:15.235
Birger Wiik, would you like
to say something?"

12:15.268 --> 12:18.338
Ehm, well I, ehm...

12:18.371 --> 12:21.308
I have you say,
I don't like this project.

12:21.341 --> 12:25.678
Eh, I love the...
hobby room,

12:25.712 --> 12:28.448
I'm still there
a couple of
hours a week.

12:28.481 --> 12:32.685
Okay, is there anybody
else that uses the room?

12:32.719 --> 12:35.155
That's a good point
Bru... Britt.

12:35.188 --> 12:38.425
Ehm...
(Exhaling)

12:38.458 --> 12:40.660
Maybe you're right.
Viveka:
Birger,

12:40.693 --> 12:42.595
you give up in a second.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.331
You're great as Britt, though.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.800
Thanks.
I don't think it's
worth fighting for.

12:46.834 --> 12:49.837
(Speaking in Swedish)

12:53.106 --> 12:55.909
Emma:
Okay, this has been
very interesting,
I've got to go.

12:55.943 --> 12:57.344
Viveka:
Now?
Yeah,

12:57.377 --> 13:01.014
I'm trying to save
my career.
Okay. (Blowing kiss)

13:01.048 --> 13:02.749
Yes, thank you guys
so much.
Nae, Britt.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.151
We're not done yet,
please.

13:04.184 --> 13:07.087
Uh, okay. See you
back (Indistinct).

13:07.120 --> 13:09.556
Oh, God.

13:09.589 --> 13:12.525
(Speaking in Swedish)

13:13.693 --> 13:14.694
Dumb cow.

13:22.502 --> 13:23.971
Bruce:
You know maybe we
should come up with
some sort of slogan,

13:24.004 --> 13:25.939
something that will
stick in people's minds.
Bra.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.844
Like Obama had
"Yes we can".

13:30.878 --> 13:33.113
Great!

13:33.146 --> 13:34.714
How about, uh...

13:34.747 --> 13:36.884
"No we cannot?"

13:36.917 --> 13:44.624
(Music)

13:44.657 --> 13:46.626
(Knocking on door)

13:46.659 --> 13:49.662
(Speaking in Swedish)

14:56.196 --> 15:01.234
(Music)

15:04.972 --> 15:06.974
Wow, look at this,
it smells great.

15:07.007 --> 15:08.775
I'm making eggs benedict!

15:08.808 --> 15:10.677
Almost ready.

15:10.710 --> 15:13.280
Okay? Wow, looks great.

15:13.313 --> 15:14.681
There you go.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.749
Wow, it's amazing.

15:16.783 --> 15:19.652
I also made some
seating charts
for the wedding

15:19.686 --> 15:21.721
so if you can take
a look at them.

15:21.754 --> 15:25.725
It's sorted by,
this one by language
and this one is by
political views,

15:25.758 --> 15:27.294
so that would be great.

15:27.327 --> 15:29.729
Okay, when did you have
time to do all this?
Last night,

15:29.762 --> 15:31.999
or I came home an hour ago

15:32.032 --> 15:35.035
and I took a shower,
and I started
with breakfast.

15:35.068 --> 15:37.037
Wow, it's amazing,

15:37.070 --> 15:38.838
it's like you're
a super girlfriend.

15:38.871 --> 15:41.808
(Chuckling)
I'm a little stressed

15:41.841 --> 15:44.044
but it's a
positive stress,
you know?

15:44.077 --> 15:46.646
I feel like,
"bring it on", huh!

15:46.679 --> 15:48.781
Okay. I got
to run, babe.

15:48.815 --> 15:50.317
So, I love you.
(Blowing kiss)

15:50.350 --> 15:51.851
Honey, you...

15:59.026 --> 16:00.560
Your phone.

16:00.593 --> 16:03.863
Is something wrong,
are you okay?
Am I okay? Okay? (Tapping)

16:03.896 --> 16:06.833
Okay? Yeah, yeah,
I'm okay.

16:06.866 --> 16:10.470
Because...
you forgot your phone.

16:10.503 --> 16:13.073
Oh, thank you.

16:13.106 --> 16:14.641
Huh!

16:14.674 --> 16:17.010
And can I have the ham
in your briefcase?

16:21.748 --> 16:23.783
Here you go.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.885
Thank you.

16:25.918 --> 16:27.420
Okay, bye.

16:30.590 --> 16:34.361
Okay, I just need
your professional
opinion on this.

16:34.394 --> 16:35.962
I've never seen Emma
like this before.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.565
She's working around
the clock, she's not sleeping.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.633
She's starting
to do some really
weird things.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.102
I think she's on crack.

16:42.135 --> 16:44.371
She's stressed,
it's obvious.

16:44.404 --> 16:47.674
About work.
No, about the marriage.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.576
No, about work.
It's the marriage.

16:49.609 --> 16:50.610
I think it's about work,

16:50.643 --> 16:52.712
but regardless
of the reason,

16:52.745 --> 16:54.047
what can I do about it?

16:54.081 --> 16:56.883
It sounds like she's
about to hit the wall.

16:56.916 --> 16:59.319
I keep hearing that phrase.
What does that mean?

16:59.352 --> 17:01.221
What is that?
"Hitting the wall"?

17:01.254 --> 17:02.789
Yeah?
It's huge in Sweden.

17:02.822 --> 17:04.891
It's almost bigger
than Melodifestivalen.

17:04.924 --> 17:06.793
Okay well, it doesn't
exist in the U.S.

17:06.826 --> 17:09.229
No of course not,
it's a Swedish song contest.

17:09.262 --> 17:12.365
No, I mean the concept
of hitting the wall.
We don't have that.

17:12.399 --> 17:14.267
So, what do you
call it?

17:14.301 --> 17:17.570
When you're tired,
overworked, stressed,

17:17.604 --> 17:20.006
and then you crash,
what do you call that?

17:20.039 --> 17:21.908
I think we just
call that "life".

17:21.941 --> 17:24.111
(Scoffing)

17:24.144 --> 17:26.179
Have you seen
"The Sopranos"?
Mm-hm.

17:26.213 --> 17:28.448
You know how Tony
has these anxiety attacks

17:28.481 --> 17:31.751
and starts crying when
some birds leave his pond?

17:31.784 --> 17:33.653
Mm-hm.
That's what happens

17:33.686 --> 17:35.755
when you're
hitting the wall.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.824
Oh my God, no!

17:37.857 --> 17:40.527
Oh, yeah.
Emma's turning Soprano?

17:54.641 --> 17:58.044
(Cellphone ringing)

18:01.214 --> 18:03.450
I'm busy.
Can I call you back?

18:03.483 --> 18:05.718
Sure. Something wrong?
I'm busy.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.320
Can I call you back?

18:07.354 --> 18:09.189
Bruce: (On phone)
Okay, but are you sure
nothing's wrong?

18:09.222 --> 18:12.159
I'll call you back, okay?
Okay.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.193
Call me later.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.531
Bruce:
Okay, everybody,
I want to welcome
our new translator.

18:18.565 --> 18:20.800
His name's Gustaf. Go.

18:24.971 --> 18:27.540
Wait, did you say
assistant coach?
No.

18:27.574 --> 18:28.975
Bruce:
Okay.

18:29.008 --> 18:31.211
'Cause you're not
my assistant...
No, no.

18:31.244 --> 18:33.446
Okay, uhm, last match,
let's be honest,

18:33.480 --> 18:35.182
didn't go so well,
so I was hoping

18:35.215 --> 18:37.984
maybe we could just
focus a little more.

18:38.017 --> 18:39.018
Go.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.164
Bruce:
Thank you.

18:51.198 --> 18:54.334
Uh, so I thought,
maybe we'll start
with two lay-up
lines. Go.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.843
(Rapid footsteps)

19:05.878 --> 19:08.481
I was right,
it was just the language!
Yeah, yeah.

19:08.515 --> 19:09.516
Yes.

19:11.951 --> 19:13.853
"Smarta", does that
mean "lay-up", or...?

19:13.886 --> 19:16.423
Yeah, it's like
a quick lay-up.
Okay...

19:23.563 --> 19:26.566
(Speaking in Swedish)

20:50.883 --> 20:53.886
(Shouting)

20:59.392 --> 21:01.628
(Screaming)

21:01.661 --> 21:04.664
(Door opening, closing)
Hi, honey.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.770
I think
something's wrong.

21:15.207 --> 21:16.208
Come here.

21:19.379 --> 21:21.147
Bruce:
Listen, I would love
to show you around,

21:21.180 --> 21:23.816
but I can't,
my girlfriend is sick.

21:23.850 --> 21:26.419
No, I mean in Sweden
they have this weird thing

21:26.453 --> 21:29.255
that's called
the Soprano disease,
or something?

21:29.288 --> 21:30.990
Bruce, can I talk
to you for a minute?

21:31.023 --> 21:33.360
Can I call you back?

21:33.393 --> 21:35.261
Yes.
Yeah, it's about
the team.

21:35.294 --> 21:38.565
I know, what a
turn-around, right?
They're so good now.

21:38.598 --> 21:40.833
It's mostly due
to this guy,
I have to say,

21:40.867 --> 21:42.268
Couldn't have
done it without him.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.705
Hey, I'm just a
natural born motivator.
Ah, brilliant.

21:45.738 --> 21:47.874
Actually Adam
told me this morning

21:47.907 --> 21:51.077
that you had threatened
to kill me and Karl

21:51.110 --> 21:53.346
if he didn't play better.

21:53.380 --> 21:56.716
What? That's crazy.
That's crazy,

21:56.749 --> 21:58.351
I told him:
"Are you crazy?"

21:58.385 --> 22:03.155
But then I called
Jens' parents and they
told me the same story.

22:03.189 --> 22:04.724
I don't even
know what to say
because that's....

22:04.757 --> 22:07.494
I... It must be kids
with their imagination
or something,

22:07.527 --> 22:09.061
I've never heard of...

22:09.095 --> 22:10.963
Gustaf, have you...?

22:10.997 --> 22:13.766
Gustaf?

22:13.800 --> 22:15.802
(Sighing)

22:19.005 --> 22:22.174
* We're not living in America
