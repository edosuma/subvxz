WEBVTT

00:56.848 --> 01:03.271
BITCH

01:06.900 --> 01:09.027
Could it be Doo-young?

01:09.861 --> 01:11.279
Is it Doo-young?

01:12.739 --> 01:14.157
It's Doo-young.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.662
The pink letter?

01:23.792 --> 01:24.959
It must be him.

01:28.379 --> 01:29.380
Who?

01:30.548 --> 01:32.509
-Doo-young...
-Ho-chang Kwon.

01:37.096 --> 01:40.433
I told you about the guy who grabbed
my hand and took me out of the cafe.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.686
You had a fling with him.

01:43.770 --> 01:44.896
It wasn't a fling.

01:46.689 --> 01:48.441
But he's kind of weird.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.693
Right? You did, right?

01:51.402 --> 01:53.279
He talks weird.

01:53.363 --> 01:54.489
I hear that a lot.

01:56.741 --> 01:58.660
He looks at me weird too.

01:59.702 --> 02:02.413
He dresses kind of weird.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.707
Anyway, he's weird.

02:04.791 --> 02:08.503
He's been hanging around me, so I said
something, and he said something weird.

02:09.254 --> 02:12.507
Be careful at night.
Don't go anywhere deserted.

02:12.590 --> 02:13.800
Don't go anywhere alone.

02:16.261 --> 02:19.097
How did he look when he said that?

02:19.180 --> 02:20.181
What?

02:20.265 --> 02:22.767
Be careful. Be careful at night.

02:22.851 --> 02:26.062
Don't go anywhere deserted
and go home early.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.272
Was that it? Or...

02:27.856 --> 02:28.940
Watch your back.

02:29.524 --> 02:32.694
Watch your step and avoid deserted areas.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.780
Don't stay out too late.

02:37.031 --> 02:37.866
Was that it?

02:39.826 --> 02:40.952
I don't know.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.289
Ho-chang Kwon. Which department?

02:44.372 --> 02:46.040
He's a senior in mechanical engineering.

02:49.335 --> 02:52.297
Hi. Seung-hwan is
in mechanical engineering, right?

02:52.463 --> 02:53.756
Is he a senior or a junior?

03:08.146 --> 03:13.026
EPISODE 7
CENTER OF THE WORLD #TheScarletLetter

03:14.611 --> 03:17.447
Ho-chang Kwon.
Senior in mechanical engineering.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.366
Winner of the 2016 Software Competition.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.577
The prize was 50 million won.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.413
No friends. No girlfriend.

03:25.496 --> 03:26.664
Unique traits.

03:26.748 --> 03:29.584
In 2015, someone was electrocuted
in the lab.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.129
Some say it was done by Ho-chang Kwon.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.340
-Electrocuted?
-Yes.

03:35.423 --> 03:38.051
Someone a year older
apparently picked on him a lot.

03:38.718 --> 03:41.095
He was electrocuted in the lab,

03:41.179 --> 03:43.431
and rumor has it
that Ho-chang was behind it.

03:43.848 --> 03:46.768
That's it? They didn't investigate?

03:46.851 --> 03:49.020
-Everyone was quiet about it.
-Why?

03:49.103 --> 03:50.772
Was the victim scared?

03:51.022 --> 03:54.817
That could be it.
Or it could've actually been an accident.

03:55.401 --> 03:59.989
Or he may have thought an investigation
would only make him look bad.

04:00.365 --> 04:04.285
Regardless, since that incident,
no one picked on him ever again.

04:06.412 --> 04:08.164
He's scary.

04:17.840 --> 04:18.841
-Hello.
-Hello.

04:24.180 --> 04:25.723
Stand clear of the closing doors.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.018
Do you have any idea what this is about?

04:29.560 --> 04:30.561
No.

04:32.188 --> 04:36.192
I'm getting a weird vibe
from the manager and the others though.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.361
Why do they want to see
just the five of us?

04:38.987 --> 04:42.282
There's nothing weird.
We just have to work hard.

04:42.365 --> 04:43.950
Hard work overcomes all.

04:44.701 --> 04:45.743
Isn't that right?

04:48.413 --> 04:50.123
You and your lines.

04:52.583 --> 04:54.252
-Have a nice day.
-Have a nice day.

04:54.335 --> 04:55.962
Have a great day.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.673
Do you know her?

04:58.756 --> 05:02.218
No, but she works for Oh and Park.
We're family.

05:26.868 --> 05:27.827
One, two, three.

05:27.910 --> 05:30.371
Hello, we're creating a new legend.
We're Asgard.

05:30.455 --> 05:31.539
-Hello!
-Hello!

05:31.622 --> 05:34.125
Okay. Sit down, all of you.

05:34.208 --> 05:35.293
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.723
Okay.

05:49.307 --> 05:52.977
We know you guys worked hard, but...

05:53.561 --> 05:55.813
You did work hard, but...

05:55.897 --> 05:57.690
-We'll work harder!
-We'll work harder!

05:57.774 --> 06:01.611
No. There's no reason to work harder.

06:02.862 --> 06:03.905
So...

06:05.323 --> 06:07.325
-Ms. Ko.
-Yes?

06:07.408 --> 06:08.868
Okay.

06:09.327 --> 06:10.661
Alright.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.123
Thank you for your hard work.

06:15.708 --> 06:19.670
I hope you understand
that it was difficult for the agency

06:19.754 --> 06:21.214
to make this decision.

06:22.006 --> 06:23.382
So, the thing is...

06:24.842 --> 06:27.428
Anyway... Mr. Cho.

06:28.179 --> 06:29.222
Pardon?

06:32.391 --> 06:33.434
Already?

06:41.609 --> 06:43.027
Okay, here.

06:45.404 --> 06:47.156
-Chang-goo.
-Thank you.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.534
-Sin-won.
-Thank you.

06:49.617 --> 06:51.285
-Woo-suk.
-Yes.

06:51.369 --> 06:52.995
-And Jin-ho.
-Thank you.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.872
-And Jin-gwang.
-Thank you.

06:55.456 --> 06:57.917
No. No need to thank me.

06:58.417 --> 07:00.336
As you will see,

07:01.462 --> 07:02.588
that is...

07:04.173 --> 07:06.926
an exclusivity cancellation contract.

07:07.009 --> 07:09.387
Minors need their parents' signatures.

07:09.762 --> 07:10.972
Another contract?

07:11.055 --> 07:13.224
-What?
-We're already exclusive with Oh and Park.

07:13.307 --> 07:16.310
We are forever a part
of the Oh and Park family.

07:17.311 --> 07:21.315
The thing is... That contract is to cancel

07:21.732 --> 07:23.317
that exclusivity.

07:25.862 --> 07:29.407
What? But we signed for seven years.
We have two years left.

07:30.199 --> 07:32.118
We mean that contract is void now.

07:33.035 --> 07:34.579
So, that is...

07:35.371 --> 07:38.708
You are now free to sign

07:38.791 --> 07:40.460
with other agencies.

07:40.543 --> 07:43.171
Wherever you want, based on
your individual skills and talents.

07:43.254 --> 07:45.047
You're free now.

07:52.597 --> 07:53.931
Other agencies? Like who?

08:00.438 --> 08:05.109
-Well... Bring them back in two days.
-Yes, sir.

08:12.867 --> 08:14.285
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

09:02.416 --> 09:05.753
The most commonly used
in impulse turbines,

09:05.836 --> 09:08.214
the Pelton turbine, is different.

09:09.048 --> 09:13.135
When you consider the rate
at which the water jet

09:13.219 --> 09:16.222
contacts verses escapes...

09:22.353 --> 09:25.398
Then, in comparison,

09:25.565 --> 09:27.858
if you say it stopped...

09:31.571 --> 09:33.864
I watched him for a few days, and...

09:34.240 --> 09:36.117
How do I say this?

09:37.326 --> 09:40.746
-Is he strange?
-He is. He's very strange.

09:41.372 --> 09:44.375
He sits at the same spot, does the same
thing, and eats the same sandwich.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.168
He sits in the same seat in lectures.

09:46.794 --> 09:50.798
He doesn't talk to anyone all day long.
He has no friends. He eats alone.

09:51.465 --> 09:53.426
I told you he was weird.

09:55.052 --> 09:57.305
That's all you found out
after all that time?

09:58.347 --> 10:01.851
I did a fact check in order to go deeper.

10:07.898 --> 10:10.026
What? What are you going to do?

10:18.993 --> 10:20.244
Hello.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.622
Hello.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.959
Is everything okay with you lately?

10:28.711 --> 10:30.296
Yes, pretty much.

10:33.049 --> 10:34.717
Okay, then.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.235
You need to consult me
before doing something.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.279
How did he look? Did he look flustered?

10:55.780 --> 10:56.822
Yes. Very.

10:57.406 --> 10:58.532
Right?

10:58.616 --> 11:02.578
-But he always looks like that.
-Right.

11:03.704 --> 11:07.458
He's always weird, so I can't tell
if he's being weird.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.587
-What do you want to eat?
-Your treat?

11:11.671 --> 11:13.214
No. I was just asking.

11:17.134 --> 11:20.471
A classic sandwich
and an iced Americano please. You?

11:21.013 --> 11:23.432
I'll take an iced tea
and a steak sandwich.

11:24.725 --> 11:26.185
Thank you.

11:27.478 --> 11:28.687
Madame Jung.

11:29.355 --> 11:30.898
You can talk to guys well again.

11:31.399 --> 11:32.400
Really?

11:34.110 --> 11:36.654
It's strange,
but I feel fine when I talk to him.

11:41.534 --> 11:42.910
Thank you.

11:44.203 --> 11:45.996
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.757
Is it 12:55 p.m.?

11:57.258 --> 11:58.217
Yes.

12:00.386 --> 12:01.387
Is it OCD?

12:01.470 --> 12:04.932
-What?
-We're out of the classic sandwich.

12:05.307 --> 12:06.851
We have mushroom.

12:09.353 --> 12:10.688
That's not good.

12:11.730 --> 12:13.774
The chicken is popular too.

12:16.610 --> 12:17.862
That's not good.

12:21.949 --> 12:25.828
Excuse me. If you're not ordering...

12:27.705 --> 12:28.706
Sure.

12:52.354 --> 12:53.272
I'm sorry.

12:53.355 --> 12:55.107
-It's okay.
-I'm sorry.

13:04.742 --> 13:06.076
Why did you do it?

13:06.160 --> 13:08.329
I thought they weren't your friends.

13:08.746 --> 13:10.122
I thought they were bullying you.

13:12.374 --> 13:13.375
Wait!

13:36.398 --> 13:38.067
Eat this.

13:40.194 --> 13:41.111
I didn't touch it.

14:07.054 --> 14:08.097
Let me have that.

14:10.558 --> 14:11.642
But you bought it for me.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.162
Why are you out here?

14:32.663 --> 14:34.999
-General Cho.
-Were you waiting for us?

14:37.293 --> 14:39.169
Well, I...

14:52.016 --> 14:55.060
So? Is it that Ho-chang guy or not?

14:56.186 --> 14:57.897
I don't think so.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.983
But I can't say he definitely isn't.

15:01.066 --> 15:03.360
Stop it. You're confusing me more.

15:04.486 --> 15:06.780
How did your cutesy tactic go?

15:07.823 --> 15:09.241
What tactic?

15:09.325 --> 15:12.453
He gave me eye drops.
He thought I had dry eyes.

15:12.536 --> 15:14.413
That's because you stink at it.

15:14.496 --> 15:15.789
I do not.

15:15.873 --> 15:18.125
I hear a lot of guys hate it
when girls act cutesy.

15:18.208 --> 15:19.710
-Says who?
-The Internet.

15:19.793 --> 15:22.713
Plus, I don't like guys who like that.

15:22.796 --> 15:24.840
That's because you suck at it.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.885
Isn't it better to ask a guy
about what guys like?

15:28.385 --> 15:30.179
Where will we find a guy?

15:30.679 --> 15:33.015
I smell a guy somewhere.

15:36.769 --> 15:37.645
There's a guy.

15:41.565 --> 15:43.567
-Hello.
-Hi.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.527
Hello.

15:46.320 --> 15:47.571
How nice.

15:49.239 --> 15:51.659
You should take off that t-shirt.

15:52.159 --> 15:53.494
Go inside.

16:02.127 --> 16:03.253
Excuse me.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.674
I would like to ask you something.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.302
Go ahead.

16:14.139 --> 16:17.101
What kind of girls do guys like?

16:18.394 --> 16:21.480
So, what I mean is...

16:21.563 --> 16:23.649
Why? Are you trying to win over a guy?

16:26.777 --> 16:27.820
Yes.

16:28.946 --> 16:30.698
Is he...

16:31.281 --> 16:32.241
me?

16:34.618 --> 16:37.121
Just kidding. I'm really kidding.

16:39.623 --> 16:42.543
Just tell him. No one would turn down
a girl like you.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.921
You're cute, you're pretty,
and you're nice.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.677
Well, it's my ex-boyfriend
who I recently broke up with.

16:53.762 --> 16:56.265
Should I be honest
and say I still like him?

16:56.348 --> 16:58.058
No, don't do that.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.269
I heard guys like aggressive girls.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.604
Aggressive is different from obsessive.

17:02.688 --> 17:06.984
Being aggressive after breaking up?
That's scary.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.946
You have to make him be aggressive.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.782
-How?
-Guys are very simple.

17:13.866 --> 17:17.536
We're very visual.
First, change your appearance.

17:17.619 --> 17:19.121
You have it all.

17:19.204 --> 17:23.834
Innocence, frailty, cuteness,
intelligence, and even elegance.

17:23.917 --> 17:26.295
But you lack one thing.
What would that be?

17:30.716 --> 17:31.759
Sexiness.

17:32.301 --> 17:33.385
What a nonsense.

17:34.636 --> 17:37.431
Right? Thank you.

17:37.514 --> 17:38.974
Good luck. Night.

17:41.727 --> 17:42.811
What are you doing?

17:50.027 --> 17:51.612
Why are you plastered to the wall?

17:51.945 --> 17:54.573
Scumbag. Pervert.

17:55.866 --> 17:56.950
Me?

17:58.077 --> 18:00.454
Hey. What did I do? Hey!

18:02.081 --> 18:03.207
What the heck?

18:12.257 --> 18:15.094
Sexy women

18:22.017 --> 18:27.481
1. Dreamy eyes, 2. Mole on nose,
3. Low-cut top, 4. Femme fatale

18:30.734 --> 18:31.902
Excuse me.

18:34.822 --> 18:37.074
Which of the two is sexier?

18:45.207 --> 18:46.125
Show us already.

18:47.334 --> 18:48.252
I just did.

18:49.128 --> 18:49.962
You did?

18:52.339 --> 18:53.841
Provocative eyes.

18:57.511 --> 18:58.554
Dreamy eyes.

19:02.015 --> 19:03.016
Which is better?

19:04.935 --> 19:06.603
Let us discuss.

19:13.110 --> 19:15.696
The second one was better.
The provocative eyes.

19:17.364 --> 19:18.991
The first one was provocative.

19:20.784 --> 19:23.287
You were provocative and dreamy?

19:23.370 --> 19:25.372
Impressive.

19:30.794 --> 19:32.838
I can't wait to see
how she looks tomorrow.

19:32.921 --> 19:34.840
I bet 500 won that it will look awkward.

19:34.923 --> 19:36.049
Me too.

19:38.302 --> 19:41.305
We can't have a bet then.

19:41.889 --> 19:43.015
You won't stop her?

19:43.599 --> 19:45.684
Why? That's how you grow.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.248
I'll see you later.

20:18.258 --> 20:19.593
Hello.

20:19.885 --> 20:20.719
Wow.

20:21.303 --> 20:22.387
See you later.

20:23.513 --> 20:24.848
Have a nice day.

20:29.770 --> 20:33.148
Is it because she's from a top school?
She's a quick learner.

20:33.732 --> 20:35.525
Why does the school matter?

20:36.151 --> 20:37.527
Why can't it?

20:38.445 --> 20:41.073
You're rude to me,
but you're polite to her.

20:41.531 --> 20:43.075
She and I are the same age.

20:43.575 --> 20:45.410
Is it because she goes to a top school?

20:47.079 --> 20:49.039
Do you have an inferiority complex?

20:50.290 --> 20:53.085
My school is better than yours.
Mine is in Seoul.

20:53.168 --> 20:54.253
Yours is in the suburbs.

20:54.836 --> 20:56.463
What about it? I don't care.

20:57.047 --> 20:59.007
And you're a year younger
than I am, right?

20:59.383 --> 21:00.717
Speak respectfully.

21:01.051 --> 21:03.887
Give me a break.
You're shorter than I am too.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.430
What was that?

21:05.639 --> 21:07.975
Why are you bringing up my height? Hey!

21:10.018 --> 21:10.936
What...

21:14.815 --> 21:16.191
Your hair grew so long.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.930
Was she always that pretty?

21:47.597 --> 21:52.477
The model treatment that we all know of
for the three-stage treatment

21:53.061 --> 21:55.856
is to make the person aware

21:55.939 --> 21:59.484
of their subconscious thoughts
to make treatment more effective.

21:59.818 --> 22:03.530
So today, we'll take a look
at an alternative attitude

22:03.613 --> 22:04.906
by another philosopher.

22:05.615 --> 22:06.908
Eun-jae.

22:10.412 --> 22:11.955
I'm sorry.

22:14.207 --> 22:15.208
What the heck?

22:20.756 --> 22:21.923
Watch out.

22:36.396 --> 22:39.024
I read about it online.
It's super popular.

22:39.941 --> 22:41.109
I can't wait.

23:08.011 --> 23:12.307
Should we get a salad and a pasta

23:12.390 --> 23:13.558
and share?

23:13.642 --> 23:15.560
Sure. Whatever you want.

23:16.186 --> 23:17.229
Excuse me.

23:22.025 --> 23:23.401
We're ready to order.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.085
What are you doing?

23:41.002 --> 23:43.004
-Why are you here?
-What about you?

23:44.172 --> 23:47.551
You punk. You said you wouldn't date
someone so young.

23:48.593 --> 23:50.554
We're just grabbing lunch.

23:50.637 --> 23:52.931
Pasta isn't just lunch.

23:53.014 --> 23:56.059
What is pasta? A lovers' meal.

23:56.143 --> 23:57.644
You bite on the same strand

23:57.727 --> 23:59.604
and nibble and then smooch.

24:01.106 --> 24:02.816
I've got you.

24:08.071 --> 24:09.114
That's tiring.

24:09.781 --> 24:10.949
You're sweating.

24:12.242 --> 24:13.577
So?

24:18.582 --> 24:19.708
Will you date her?

24:20.333 --> 24:22.544
She wanted to discuss a problem,
that's all.

24:22.794 --> 24:25.172
"Sung-min. I have a problem
weighing me down.

24:25.255 --> 24:27.465
I like you. What do I do?"

24:32.512 --> 24:33.513
Are you doing it again?

24:35.056 --> 24:38.101
So? What if she says that?
Will you go out with her?

24:40.645 --> 24:41.688
Do you want me to?

24:42.606 --> 24:45.192
Why are you asking me?
Can't you make decisions?

24:47.777 --> 24:50.322
Is the ringing in your ears gone?

24:50.906 --> 24:52.532
No. It comes back at times.

24:53.450 --> 24:54.743
Go to a big hospital.

24:54.826 --> 24:56.995
I have no time. I'm busy.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.247
I need to get a job, remember?

25:02.042 --> 25:04.544
-What?
-This is what a busy person does?

25:04.753 --> 25:08.089
I made time in my busy schedule
to tease you.

25:08.381 --> 25:09.341
You should be honored.

25:10.592 --> 25:11.676
Later.

25:33.198 --> 25:36.451
Why did you go outside?
There's a bathroom inside.

25:37.035 --> 25:39.037
I had to step out.

25:39.454 --> 25:40.997
What did you need to talk about?

25:41.790 --> 25:43.124
Let's eat first.

25:44.459 --> 25:48.255
Just in case, but don't tell me
that you like me or anything.

25:59.015 --> 26:02.310
There's a rumor that
we'll be audited in April,

26:02.394 --> 26:05.272
-so make sure we have all the documents.
-Yes, sir.

26:05.355 --> 26:10.402
As for the cancellation
of Asgard's exclusivity contract...

26:13.280 --> 26:14.489
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes?

26:18.368 --> 26:20.245
I'm sorry. It's the director.

26:22.664 --> 26:23.540
Hello?

26:24.040 --> 26:25.834
-Ja-eun.
-Yes?

26:26.126 --> 26:29.045
We already talked to them,
so you just have to get the documents.

26:29.129 --> 26:32.799
Mr. Cho. I'm really busy
with the international concert

26:32.882 --> 26:34.551
and with the legal department.

26:43.059 --> 26:44.185
Will you be okay?

26:46.062 --> 26:47.939
They must be very upset.

26:48.523 --> 26:50.358
What if they get angry
and take it out on you?

26:50.900 --> 26:52.652
Mr. Cho, seriously.

26:52.736 --> 26:55.030
He makes his employees do
the work he doesn't want to do.

26:55.822 --> 26:57.615
Shouldn't he do it himself?

26:59.868 --> 27:01.870
Then will you help me?

27:02.787 --> 27:06.082
I told you. I have a lot of work.

27:07.542 --> 27:11.004
And I'm not good at saying
unpleasant things to people.

27:12.547 --> 27:14.758
Who's good at saying unpleasant things?

27:17.635 --> 27:20.096
Did I say something wrong?

27:21.806 --> 27:22.849
No.

27:24.434 --> 27:25.977
I'm just nervous, that's all.

27:32.317 --> 27:34.277
Be careful, especially with Thor.

27:34.861 --> 27:36.613
I heard he fought a lot in school.

27:37.697 --> 27:38.698
Yes?

27:59.844 --> 28:02.555
Please, can you give me another chance?

28:03.139 --> 28:04.599
I'll work super hard.

28:05.683 --> 28:09.771
Please, give me another chance. Please!

28:11.898 --> 28:13.942
This is all I've been doing
for seven years.

28:17.654 --> 28:20.073
WOO-SUK PARK

28:22.992 --> 28:26.037
BALDR, JIN-HO CHOI

28:28.623 --> 28:29.666
Shit.

28:29.749 --> 28:31.292
Why did you bother picking us?

28:31.376 --> 28:33.920
You picked us and said we would succeed.

28:34.003 --> 28:36.714
And since we didn't,
you tell us to quit. Bastards.

28:37.257 --> 28:39.384
If we succeed, it's thanks to you.

28:39.467 --> 28:41.553
If we don't, it's our fault.

28:42.679 --> 28:43.763
What a joke.

28:43.847 --> 28:45.348
You should've cut us loose sooner.

28:45.432 --> 28:47.350
Imagine if I worked during that time.

28:49.227 --> 28:50.603
What are you looking at?

28:50.687 --> 28:52.397
I'll set this place on fire.

28:54.190 --> 28:55.191
I hope you burn.

28:55.817 --> 28:58.903
UR, SIN-WON KIM

29:04.492 --> 29:05.744
Is that right?

29:06.619 --> 29:07.871
It's for the best.

29:08.329 --> 29:10.582
What's the point
in holding onto a failure?

29:11.207 --> 29:14.794
It's a waste of money and time.

29:15.378 --> 29:17.922
What the heck is Asgard? How humiliating.

29:18.715 --> 29:20.592
Thor, Baldr, Heimdallr...

29:21.259 --> 29:22.510
How humiliating.

29:22.677 --> 29:24.929
Thank goodness we didn't make it big.
Imagine if we had.

29:25.013 --> 29:27.432
If we had entered Europe or somewhere...

29:28.016 --> 29:29.309
How humiliating.

29:29.392 --> 29:30.727
TYR, CHANG-GOO SHIN

29:31.436 --> 29:32.896
Hello.

29:34.898 --> 29:36.024
Here.

29:51.998 --> 29:53.500
Thank you for everything.

29:54.667 --> 29:55.752
Okay.

29:56.586 --> 29:57.879
That's all.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.215
It's hard, isn't it?

30:02.842 --> 30:03.760
Pardon?

30:06.054 --> 30:08.932
This wouldn't have happened
if we had been better.

30:10.058 --> 30:11.559
It's all our fault.

30:13.770 --> 30:16.689
-Thank...
-If we hadn't made a mistake at our debut.

30:18.149 --> 30:20.401
The agency tried so hard for us.

30:23.196 --> 30:24.322
I'm sorry.

30:26.741 --> 30:27.617
I'm sorry.

30:29.577 --> 30:30.745
Have a nice day.

31:21.045 --> 31:23.339
HEIMDALLR, JIN-GWANG LEE

31:37.729 --> 31:38.938
Hello, Mr. Lee.

31:39.647 --> 31:41.858
This is Jin-myung Yoon from Management.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.320
Heimdallr hasn't been here yet.

31:46.487 --> 31:47.530
Yes.

31:50.283 --> 31:53.328
Please ask him to call me
when you reach him.

31:56.289 --> 31:57.373
Okay.

32:09.177 --> 32:10.094
EXCLUSIVITY TERMINATION

32:17.393 --> 32:18.603
Did it go okay?

32:19.103 --> 32:19.938
Yes.

32:31.115 --> 32:33.034
I needed a sugar rush.

32:35.370 --> 32:38.164
Sorry. Was it something special?

32:38.247 --> 32:39.582
From your boyfriend?

32:41.084 --> 32:42.126
No.

32:49.050 --> 32:51.219
When food goes bad,

32:51.302 --> 32:56.182
the natural state of the food changes,
gets dehydrated, and damaged.

32:56.683 --> 33:00.311
It loses its original characteristics.

33:00.395 --> 33:03.481
What types of changes are there?

33:04.107 --> 33:07.527
Let's start with what we're familiar with.

33:55.324 --> 33:56.868
What are you doing there?

34:00.246 --> 34:01.748
You've been following me.

34:03.166 --> 34:04.250
Well...

34:04.333 --> 34:06.502
Why are you standing by my locker?

34:10.590 --> 34:11.716
Well...

34:12.550 --> 34:14.552
Have you been okay lately?

34:15.511 --> 34:16.512
What?

34:17.138 --> 34:18.514
Are you

34:19.599 --> 34:21.100
getting strange texts...

34:30.151 --> 34:31.277
Here.

34:32.195 --> 34:33.321
What is that?

34:34.238 --> 34:35.698
-Take it.
-No. What is it?

34:37.492 --> 34:39.619
I made it. Take it.

34:40.036 --> 34:41.454
I said no!

35:06.938 --> 35:08.022
I'm sorry.

35:09.690 --> 35:10.900
It wasn't that loud

35:12.110 --> 35:13.528
when I tested it at home.

35:16.906 --> 35:18.741
Did you make it yourself?

35:19.492 --> 35:20.493
Yes.

35:21.661 --> 35:22.912
For me?

35:23.788 --> 35:24.622
Yes.

35:26.707 --> 35:27.542
Why?

35:29.877 --> 35:32.755
I was worried about you.

35:34.882 --> 35:38.469
Why are you worried about me?

35:44.016 --> 35:45.518
Because of the strange text.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.896
My mom saw it
and said she was worried about you.

35:51.399 --> 35:54.068
I don't understand anything you're saying.

35:55.403 --> 35:57.321
I hear that a lot.

36:00.408 --> 36:02.743
Did you get a strange text? Let me see.

36:05.371 --> 36:06.581
You won't like it.

36:18.634 --> 36:20.678
BITCH

36:22.180 --> 36:24.765
Is it worse than this?

36:26.809 --> 36:28.978
It's okay. Let me see it.

36:52.084 --> 36:56.714
Did you know Ye-eun was abducted
by her boyfriend?

37:00.426 --> 37:04.180
Did you ask what happened during
those three days? Stay away from her.

37:08.851 --> 37:11.562
What is it? What's wrong?

37:11.771 --> 37:13.898
Oh, no.

37:14.649 --> 37:16.609
Do you want water? Drink some water.

37:21.447 --> 37:24.325
Here. Water.

37:25.201 --> 37:26.202
Water.

37:42.385 --> 37:45.263
When did you receive this?

37:49.558 --> 37:50.393
The seventh.

37:52.561 --> 37:54.313
You got it before I got mine.

38:01.529 --> 38:02.655
That's strange.

38:04.824 --> 38:08.119
Why would anyone call
someone as nice as you...

38:09.704 --> 38:11.163
a bitch?

38:13.207 --> 38:14.208
Why...

38:16.961 --> 38:19.505
do you think I'm a nice person?

38:20.131 --> 38:21.757
You gave me your sandwich.

38:25.845 --> 38:29.724
Someone who's nice to a person like me

38:30.641 --> 38:31.809
is a nice person.

38:35.563 --> 38:39.734
What is a person "like you"?

38:42.570 --> 38:43.654
Just...

38:44.488 --> 38:47.199
Because I'm kind of... You know.

38:56.334 --> 38:59.128
-You said you made this yourself?
-Yes.

39:00.004 --> 39:03.174
Look. If you press this,
the alarm goes off.

39:03.341 --> 39:04.550
This lights up too.

39:05.801 --> 39:09.388
If you press both sides, it's a Taser.

39:09.972 --> 39:12.975
It's 60,000 volts. That's the legal limit.

39:13.559 --> 39:15.811
I wanted to see how much it hurts,

39:16.354 --> 39:19.357
but I couldn't dare.
It looked too painful to try.

39:20.649 --> 39:24.236
I'm not that nice of a person.

39:27.156 --> 39:28.574
You are a nice person.

39:31.619 --> 39:33.662
If I were a nice person,

39:35.164 --> 39:37.458
I wouldn't be hated so much.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.297
-Ye-eun!
-Are you okay?

39:44.006 --> 39:45.174
Yes.

39:48.636 --> 39:50.888
Thank you for this.

39:57.853 --> 40:00.815
What's this about an alarm going off?

40:00.898 --> 40:02.691
It wasn't anything serious.

40:02.775 --> 40:03.818
Just...

40:06.278 --> 40:07.738
The other person is bad!

40:13.953 --> 40:15.454
The person who hates you

40:16.205 --> 40:17.581
is the bad person.

40:19.834 --> 40:21.419
You are a nice person.

40:22.503 --> 40:23.712
You're nice...

40:25.506 --> 40:26.799
and pretty.

41:03.919 --> 41:05.129
Hey.

41:09.508 --> 41:10.342
Here.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.806
It's for Professor Yoon's research.

41:20.686 --> 41:22.396
It isn't that hard.

41:23.397 --> 41:24.899
Check each item...

41:56.764 --> 41:58.098
Did you do something to her?

42:15.699 --> 42:17.451
I almost had him.

42:18.160 --> 42:20.246
Will you be happy if you get him
to date you?

42:22.414 --> 42:25.417
You weren't being yourself. It was an act.

42:25.501 --> 42:27.044
That's not who you are.

42:32.967 --> 42:33.801
Hi there.

42:34.385 --> 42:36.971
-Where's Ye-eun?
-She isn't back yet?

42:37.263 --> 42:38.847
Why are you home so early?

42:53.153 --> 42:56.073
-Hey. Hold this for me.
-I can't. I'm busy.

42:56.407 --> 42:58.534
-Where are you going?
-For a walk.

42:58.701 --> 43:00.578
-This late?
-Yes.

43:01.328 --> 43:03.038
Why is she going out so late?

43:10.379 --> 43:11.380
Let's go.

43:19.930 --> 43:22.516
-Careful. It's 60,000 volts.
-Okay.

43:25.019 --> 43:28.689
If Ho-chang didn't send that text,
who did?

43:30.441 --> 43:33.444
-Did you get another one?
-No.

43:34.111 --> 43:37.406
-A week passed, right?
-About 11 days.

43:39.116 --> 43:42.911
-Maybe that was it, and it'll stop.
-I hope so.

43:43.537 --> 43:46.624
Ask him to take you home from now on.

43:46.707 --> 43:48.417
We're not like that.

43:48.584 --> 43:51.420
If he gave you that, yes, you are.

43:54.465 --> 43:55.549
Where are you going?

44:01.555 --> 44:03.182
Are you going together?

44:04.642 --> 44:05.934
Hello.

44:07.269 --> 44:08.520
She wanted to take a walk.

44:08.854 --> 44:10.814
Where to? A park?

44:13.192 --> 44:14.193
Go ahead.

44:16.195 --> 44:17.279
Good night.

44:26.914 --> 44:29.416
-Why are you following me?
-To take a walk.

44:30.584 --> 44:32.878
-Go ahead.
-Aren't you going for a walk?

44:33.170 --> 44:36.674
-Forget it.
-She's so fickle.

44:39.635 --> 44:42.179
-Stop following me.
-I'll do what I want.

44:45.432 --> 44:48.143
-Stop following me.
-I'll do what I want.

44:49.895 --> 44:50.896
What?

44:52.231 --> 44:54.024
I'm walking where I want.

45:28.767 --> 45:29.768
Hello.

45:29.852 --> 45:31.603
-Hi.
-Hello.

45:39.903 --> 45:44.491
It was just on your desk,
so I didn't know it was special.

45:48.120 --> 45:50.747
It wasn't special. It was just candy.

45:51.415 --> 45:53.709
Not according to the face you made.

45:53.792 --> 45:55.210
I felt so bad.

45:57.588 --> 45:58.755
-Hello.
-Hello.

45:58.839 --> 46:01.675
Jin-myung. How did the Asgard matter go?

46:02.342 --> 46:05.262
-I'll finish it within the day.
-Okay.

46:14.480 --> 46:15.689
-You have your stuff?
-Yes.

46:18.567 --> 46:19.985
See you...

46:23.780 --> 46:24.698
Bye.

47:11.787 --> 47:14.414
Excuse me. Is Heimdallr here?

47:15.207 --> 47:17.459
No. He left this morning.

47:19.086 --> 47:20.796
Is there a way to reach him?

47:20.879 --> 47:24.299
See what happens when you don't
even let us have cell phones.

47:28.554 --> 47:29.721
Hello?

47:30.764 --> 47:32.599
Thor. This is for you.

47:34.893 --> 47:35.936
Hello?

47:37.354 --> 47:39.898
Hi, Mom. Already?

47:41.441 --> 47:43.068
Okay. Wait a minute.

47:47.364 --> 47:51.451
Sorry. He'll be back,
since he has nowhere else to go.

47:52.369 --> 47:55.539
If he comes back,
would you ask him to call me?

47:55.622 --> 47:56.790
I will.

48:00.002 --> 48:04.047
MOOAM-GIL 93-7

48:09.678 --> 48:10.762
Mom.

48:11.346 --> 48:12.514
Woo-suk.

48:17.227 --> 48:19.521
-I'm sorry, Mom.
-Sorry for what?

48:20.188 --> 48:22.441
Don't cry. Why are you crying?

48:23.358 --> 48:27.487
It's okay.

48:30.699 --> 48:34.161
Did you eat? Did you eat anything?

48:34.536 --> 48:37.664
Did you finish packing?

48:43.629 --> 48:46.048
-Ye-eun.
-Are you done with class?

48:46.590 --> 48:48.759
Yes. What are you doing here?

48:49.343 --> 48:51.303
What else? Let's go eat.

48:52.304 --> 48:53.513
Ye-eun!

48:55.515 --> 48:56.725
Are you done with class?

48:57.601 --> 48:59.019
I'm not late, am I?

49:06.777 --> 49:10.280
He seems nice, doesn't he?
Although he is a bit frustrating.

49:12.199 --> 49:13.283
He does.

49:14.117 --> 49:17.579
Let's stop worrying about her
and worry about ourselves now.

49:22.501 --> 49:23.502
Yoo-kyung.

49:28.465 --> 49:30.133
Ye-eun is lucky.

49:30.592 --> 49:32.636
She's surrounded by nice people.

49:33.178 --> 49:34.429
And you're one of them.

49:36.181 --> 49:37.307
Am I?

49:39.309 --> 49:42.688
I think Ye-eun has too many
nice people around her.

49:52.948 --> 49:54.700
Why do you eat only this?

49:56.243 --> 49:59.037
-This tastes the best.
-Have you tried other stuff?

49:59.871 --> 50:00.914
No.

50:00.997 --> 50:04.418
Then shall we try a different one
next time?

50:05.836 --> 50:06.670
No.

50:12.008 --> 50:14.970
It was such a struggle to stay awake.

50:16.555 --> 50:19.725
You're done for the day, right?
Let's go watch a movie.

50:20.142 --> 50:21.393
-A movie?
-Yes.

50:25.188 --> 50:28.650
-I can't.
-Why not? Who is it?

50:29.735 --> 50:30.861
Is it Jang-hoon?

50:40.996 --> 50:42.247
Come for a haircut.

50:43.415 --> 50:44.416
Hi.

50:56.303 --> 50:57.471
Sit here.

51:05.270 --> 51:06.354
What now?

51:06.688 --> 51:10.317
What do you mean?
It's time for your haircut.

51:10.984 --> 51:13.111
Short hair looks messy if it grows out.

51:13.195 --> 51:15.030
You should trim it often.

51:17.282 --> 51:19.034
Did you hear from Dad?

51:28.168 --> 51:29.878
She starts school next year.

51:31.213 --> 51:32.339
Who?

51:37.093 --> 51:38.011
Before he left,

51:39.095 --> 51:42.140
he begged me to sign the divorce papers.

51:43.266 --> 51:45.685
He looked like
he would get on his knees if I said so.

51:48.438 --> 51:49.856
Why don't you just divorce him?

51:51.066 --> 51:51.983
For whom?

51:53.193 --> 51:57.197
Those cheating bastards deserve
the inconvenience. That's only fair.

51:58.573 --> 52:00.242
It's inconvenient for you too.

52:05.413 --> 52:06.623
It's been eight years.

52:07.165 --> 52:11.169
If he liked one woman for eight years,
he didn't just cheat, they genuinely...

52:11.253 --> 52:12.629
Don't move. I might cut your ear.

52:16.800 --> 52:18.802
Did your dad abandon just me?

52:20.387 --> 52:24.099
He abandoned you too.
Don't act all high and mighty.

52:31.815 --> 52:33.066
-Daddy.
-Yes?

52:33.149 --> 52:35.735
-Are you doing it right?
-Of course.

52:36.611 --> 52:37.571
There.

53:16.526 --> 53:19.988
-Don't stay out so late.
-What are you doing here?

53:20.071 --> 53:22.699
Madam Ye-ji told me to pick you up.

53:23.825 --> 53:25.118
How obedient of you.

53:25.785 --> 53:28.163
She said she would
put a curse on me if I didn't.

53:33.418 --> 53:34.586
Is something wrong?

53:36.838 --> 53:40.133
She said you'll probably be depressed.

53:41.676 --> 53:43.011
Why did she say that?

53:48.141 --> 53:50.018
How long have you and Ye-ji been friends?

53:52.187 --> 53:53.229
Since kindergarten.

53:54.230 --> 53:56.650
We went to grade school
and junior high together.

53:56.733 --> 54:00.362
We went to different high schools,
and now, we're at the same college.

54:00.862 --> 54:02.280
That's crazy long.

54:04.658 --> 54:07.035
Were you always tall?

54:09.120 --> 54:11.539
I was average through grade school,

54:11.623 --> 54:13.708
but I suddenly grew in junior high.

54:15.043 --> 54:16.169
What's your secret?

54:17.003 --> 54:18.088
Genetics.

54:20.757 --> 54:21.925
Thank you.

54:26.805 --> 54:28.473
Long time ago,

54:29.265 --> 54:31.935
I thought I could control

54:32.560 --> 54:34.854
liking or disliking someone.

54:35.313 --> 54:36.356
But?

54:38.191 --> 54:42.904
Back then, it was obvious
who was good and who was bad.

54:44.280 --> 54:45.824
Did you cut your hair?

54:47.534 --> 54:50.245
You'll end up becoming a monk
at that rate.

54:51.413 --> 54:53.206
It's shorter than mine.

54:54.374 --> 54:58.378
You have a bad temper,
so your hair doesn't last.

54:58.878 --> 55:01.131
Try growing your hair. Who knows?

55:01.214 --> 55:02.465
It may look cute.

55:02.841 --> 55:05.218
Guys and girls are all about the hair...

55:07.679 --> 55:08.680
Hey.

55:10.682 --> 55:11.933
Are you crying?

55:15.186 --> 55:16.354
I was just...

56:10.658 --> 56:12.619
Excuse me. Just a minute.

56:13.078 --> 56:14.287
Why?

56:15.622 --> 56:17.957
-Just a minute.
-Don't follow me.

56:18.249 --> 56:19.793
Let's talk.

56:20.627 --> 56:22.921
I said not to follow me!

56:23.505 --> 56:24.798
Let's talk.

56:31.429 --> 56:32.514
Are you okay?

56:33.932 --> 56:35.183
Are you blind?

56:37.018 --> 56:38.061
I'm bleeding.

56:40.814 --> 56:43.483
-So why did you run away?
-Crap.

56:44.526 --> 56:46.236
I ran because you chased me.

56:46.653 --> 56:49.114
Why did you chase me?
People will misunderstand.

56:54.577 --> 56:55.995
The exclusivity cancellation...

56:58.248 --> 56:59.249
What happened?

57:00.125 --> 57:01.501
I lost it.

57:09.968 --> 57:11.928
The others already signed.

57:15.598 --> 57:17.559
This won't change anything.

57:30.447 --> 57:31.781
I'll be back tomorrow.

59:14.425 --> 59:16.135
-Hello.
-Hi.

59:20.848 --> 59:22.308
OPEN LOCKER

59:31.859 --> 59:35.572
When I was young,
I was the center of the world.

59:37.949 --> 59:39.409
I thought if I fell asleep,

59:39.492 --> 59:42.328
the entire world stopped moving.

59:48.126 --> 59:49.836
The world moved for me,

59:49.919 --> 59:52.463
and I couldn't imagine a world without me.

59:54.632 --> 59:56.175
-Were you sleeping?
-Yes.

59:56.259 --> 59:57.510
Here.

59:59.429 --> 1:00:00.388
During those days,

1:00:01.556 --> 1:00:06.352
everything in the world
existed to love me.

1:00:07.437 --> 1:00:08.479
They called to complain

1:00:08.563 --> 1:00:09.522
-Hi.
-that it's wrong.

1:00:09.606 --> 1:00:10.440
Hello.

1:00:10.523 --> 1:00:12.317
-The numbers are wrong.
-Hi.

1:00:12.650 --> 1:00:15.570
-Did you check thoroughly?
-I'm sorry.

1:00:15.653 --> 1:00:17.697
We have to print a correction,
so call them.

1:00:17.780 --> 1:00:19.949
-Yes, sir.
-You write the correction article.

1:00:20.033 --> 1:00:20.992
Okay.

1:00:22.327 --> 1:00:24.704
-He isn't answering?
-I'll try again.

1:00:24.787 --> 1:00:26.456
That's why you should've done it sooner.

1:00:26.956 --> 1:00:28.374
When was it?

1:00:29.042 --> 1:00:30.877
When did I realize

1:00:30.960 --> 1:00:35.048
that the world continues to move
even without me?

1:00:40.303 --> 1:00:42.013
When was it?

1:00:42.680 --> 1:00:47.977
When did I realize that I was not
the center of the world?

1:00:50.813 --> 1:00:52.357
When was it?

1:00:53.733 --> 1:00:54.776
When did I

1:00:55.443 --> 1:00:58.446
genuinely realize that I was just one

1:00:58.821 --> 1:01:00.990
of the countless people out there?

1:01:01.532 --> 1:01:04.786
If you already have that many C and D,
you need to at least get a B.

1:01:04.994 --> 1:01:07.705
Look at my grades. There are a lot of A's.

1:01:09.582 --> 1:01:11.250
When was it?

1:01:13.044 --> 1:01:17.215
When did I start to put another person
at the center of my world?

1:01:24.722 --> 1:01:26.432
I realized that there are things

1:01:26.516 --> 1:01:29.394
that I can't have,
no matter how desperately I want them.

1:01:33.314 --> 1:01:34.982
Was everything okay last night?

1:01:42.240 --> 1:01:44.992
-Why are you here?
-Because I feel like it.

1:01:45.410 --> 1:01:46.786
You come too often.

1:01:47.662 --> 1:01:50.081
I'm not here to see you, so don't mind me.

1:01:50.164 --> 1:01:53.376
-Just move in, why don't you?
-Whatever.

1:01:55.211 --> 1:01:56.462
When was it?

1:01:57.380 --> 1:01:59.590
When did I start hating myself

1:02:00.633 --> 1:02:02.260
because I was angry?

1:02:07.306 --> 1:02:08.599
Today,

1:02:09.475 --> 1:02:11.436
I realize painfully again...

1:02:11.519 --> 1:02:13.855
Whore

1:02:13.938 --> 1:02:16.691
That just as I can hate someone else,

1:02:17.358 --> 1:02:18.526
someone else

1:02:19.902 --> 1:02:22.447
can also hate me.

1:02:26.534 --> 1:02:27.744
Someone...

1:02:29.162 --> 1:02:30.913
hates me.

1:02:32.123 --> 1:02:33.249
-Ye-eun.
-Ye-eun.

1:02:34.792 --> 1:02:35.793
What's wrong?

1:02:38.546 --> 1:02:40.506
Whore

1:02:40.590 --> 1:02:43.551
It's okay.

1:02:46.429 --> 1:02:48.514
It's okay. Calm down.

1:03:04.989 --> 1:03:06.491
Is it him? Is it Doo-young?

1:03:06.574 --> 1:03:08.910
There are two guys there.
One tall and one short.

1:03:08.993 --> 1:03:10.369
Don't come. He might have a knife.

1:03:10.495 --> 1:03:13.039
-Run! Don't worry...
-And they say they aren't dating.

1:03:13.122 --> 1:03:15.750
What does Ye-eun plan to do?
Will she call the police?

1:03:15.833 --> 1:03:18.503
-Maybe it's all over online.
-Nothing's been confirmed.

1:03:18.586 --> 1:03:19.462
You can't do this.

1:03:19.545 --> 1:03:21.380
-Jin-myung.
-They made a deal.

1:03:21.464 --> 1:03:24.550
You are a nice person.
A nice and pretty person.

1:03:24.634 --> 1:03:25.760
Eun-jae.

1:03:25.843 --> 1:03:26.761
Somewhat hopeful.

1:03:26.844 --> 1:03:28.387
-Pack your things.
-Take care.

1:03:28.471 --> 1:03:29.555
Somewhat regretful.

1:03:29.639 --> 1:03:31.766
The reason I moved
in here was this letter.

1:03:31.849 --> 1:03:32.892
Eun-jae!

1:03:32.975 --> 1:03:34.936
I like you, Eun-jae.

1:03:43.027 --> 1:03:46.531
PLEASE HAVE MERCY.

1:03:46.614 --> 1:03:48.491
MAY DEATH BRING HER PEACE.

1:03:48.574 --> 1:03:51.494
MAY DEATH BRING HER PEACE.

1:03:53.788 --> 1:03:56.958
SHE LOVED AND WAS LOVED THAN ANYONE.

1:03:59.377 --> 1:04:03.089
EVERY MOMENT WAS PURE LUCK FOR HER.

1:04:05.424 --> 1:04:09.011
SHE LIVED EVERY SINGLE DAY TO THE FULLEST.

1:04:09.095 --> 1:04:11.514
