WEBVTT

00:00.050 --> 00:01.255
Jack Griffith.

00:01.256 --> 00:02.488
We were more than colleagues.

00:02.490 --> 00:04.390
We were married.

00:04.392 --> 00:06.479
You know Warren set up this whole meeting

00:06.480 --> 00:07.705
to deliver my money.

00:07.705 --> 00:08.961
What you don't know

00:08.963 --> 00:10.635
is that he also promised to deliver

00:10.635 --> 00:11.975
the source of the leak.

00:11.975 --> 00:14.499
Is it possible to have the same
feelings for two men at once?

00:14.499 --> 00:16.991
Of course it is! But, ultimately,

00:16.991 --> 00:18.504
you need to make a choice.

00:23.378 --> 00:24.578
Jack?

00:41.955 --> 00:44.022
You're going to have to
talk to Jack eventually.

00:44.064 --> 00:45.431
Not tonight.

00:45.873 --> 00:46.999
Fair enough.

00:47.651 --> 00:49.735
- You want to talk to me about it?
- No

00:50.238 --> 00:51.805
You want me to leave?

00:52.154 --> 00:54.028
- No!
- Do you want a hug?

00:54.370 --> 00:55.570
Yes.

01:00.882 --> 01:02.409
Come here.

01:03.451 --> 01:04.650
It's okay.

01:10.315 --> 01:13.166
Are you sorry we started
to paint the living room?

01:14.963 --> 01:17.747
Yes! Yes.

01:19.434 --> 01:20.800
I love you.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.587
I love you, too.

01:23.613 --> 01:27.607
- Okay, so... that's the Big Dipper, right?
- Right.

01:27.609 --> 01:30.074
And that's the extent of
my knowledge of astronomy.

01:30.632 --> 01:32.002
Oh, no, wait. One more.

01:32.003 --> 01:33.402
That's the North Star, right?

01:33.403 --> 01:34.913
Ooh. Venus.

01:34.913 --> 01:36.117
But it's so bright.

01:36.442 --> 01:37.796
Well, after the sun and the moon,

01:37.796 --> 01:40.019
Venus is one of the
brightest things in our sky.

01:40.021 --> 01:41.972
The Mayans actually based
their entire calendar on it.

01:41.973 --> 01:44.102
And to the Greeks, she
was the goddess of love.

01:46.375 --> 01:47.575
And beauty.

01:49.013 --> 01:51.197
How do you know all this star stuff?

01:51.199 --> 01:53.432
Did a lot of stargazing in Iraq.

01:55.965 --> 01:57.414
You think the stars are bright here,

01:57.415 --> 01:59.058
you should see them in the Syrian Desert.

02:01.015 --> 02:02.341
You know, this is, uh,

02:02.623 --> 02:04.918
well, I don't know what
it is, but it's good.

02:05.373 --> 02:06.897
Just the two of us.

02:07.115 --> 02:08.538
Together.

02:09.517 --> 02:11.811
It's the happiest I've been in a long time.

02:28.795 --> 02:30.020
_

02:47.484 --> 02:48.688
Freeze! FBI!

02:48.690 --> 02:50.039
Easy! Easy! Easy!

03:15.720 --> 03:17.116
Good morning, Luke.

03:17.320 --> 03:18.562
I just got here.

03:19.275 --> 03:21.427
- Excuse me?
- Justine invited me for breakfast,

03:21.428 --> 03:23.188
and I've only been here
for about 20 minutes.

03:23.753 --> 03:24.960
Okay.

03:24.961 --> 03:26.708
I just didn't want you to
think that I spent the night.

03:27.963 --> 03:29.909
Mom, what have you done to the living room?

03:30.148 --> 03:33.190
When I came in last night, I was almost
knocked over by the smell of paint.

03:33.190 --> 03:36.121
Oh. I had a... sudden
burst of creative energy.

03:36.121 --> 03:38.167
I thought I heard Jack. Is he here?

03:38.167 --> 03:39.597
No.

03:39.659 --> 03:42.406
So, um, what are your plans today?

03:42.406 --> 03:45.423
Um, I'm going to register
for classes for the fall

03:45.423 --> 03:47.921
- and look for a job.
- A job?

03:47.921 --> 03:49.721
I know you said you'd pay
for school, but I think

03:49.722 --> 03:51.723
it's time I start paying
for everything else.

03:51.723 --> 03:53.143
Good for you.

03:53.393 --> 03:55.216
But I do think

03:55.217 --> 03:57.486
that you guys should go out
and do something fun today.

03:57.487 --> 03:58.799
It's a beautiful day.

03:58.799 --> 04:00.680
Mom, Are you trying to get rid of us?

04:00.680 --> 04:02.626
No! It's a beautiful day.

04:02.626 --> 04:06.296
She's right. Why don't I take
you out for a real breakfast?

04:06.748 --> 04:08.100
A knife-and-fork breakfast?

04:08.102 --> 04:09.521
Yeah. Why not?

04:09.521 --> 04:11.312
Why not? Thanks, Mom.

04:22.450 --> 04:24.984
Just wanted to let you know Eric is safe.

04:24.986 --> 04:26.986
- Was he hurt?
- They roughed him up a little.

04:26.988 --> 04:28.601
More shaken than hurt.

04:28.988 --> 04:30.189
Do you want to talk to him?

04:30.191 --> 04:31.529
Uh, yes.

04:32.994 --> 04:34.694
Hey, Dad.

04:34.696 --> 04:36.669
Eric.

04:36.669 --> 04:37.494
I'm sorry.

04:37.494 --> 04:39.406
I'm so sorry. I should've listened to you.

04:39.827 --> 04:41.233
To both of you.

04:41.235 --> 04:43.691
No. All that matters is that you're okay.

04:44.278 --> 04:46.138
- Do you want me to come there?
- No.

04:46.140 --> 04:48.797
I gotta finish talking to the FBI, and
then Rebecca's going to take me home.

04:48.798 --> 04:50.343
Okay. I love you.

04:50.345 --> 04:51.811
I love you, too, Dad.

05:11.866 --> 05:13.265
You sneaking up on me?

05:13.653 --> 05:16.602
Nope. Just waiting for you to finish.

05:16.604 --> 05:18.029
Well, I'm finished.

05:18.831 --> 05:20.529
I called you last night.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.308
I was at Olivia's.

05:24.611 --> 05:28.481
Look, this whole thing
about Alex and the rodeo...

05:28.720 --> 05:30.574
I guess I'm just not feeling very good

05:30.574 --> 05:32.285
about where things are right now.

05:32.285 --> 05:34.873
Do you really think I have
eyes for any other woman?

05:34.873 --> 05:36.584
I saw how she looked at you.

05:36.584 --> 05:38.116
Did you see the way I looked at her?

05:39.360 --> 05:41.794
There's nothing going
on between me and Alex.

05:43.731 --> 05:45.698
You two have this bond that... that...

05:45.699 --> 05:47.375
We have this in common.

05:47.951 --> 05:49.625
Ranching, horses.

05:49.625 --> 05:52.192
She's an employee. That's
all she's ever going to be.

05:52.194 --> 05:53.462
If she wants more?

05:53.462 --> 05:54.782
I don't want more!

05:56.098 --> 05:57.748
What can I say to you, to convince you

05:57.749 --> 06:00.194
that you're the only
woman I want in my life?

06:02.137 --> 06:03.355
I don't think there's

06:03.356 --> 06:05.912
anything either one of
us can say right now.

06:06.659 --> 06:09.341
We may have gotten to a place
where words aren't gonna help.

06:10.057 --> 06:11.690
Which is okay with me...

06:11.999 --> 06:13.832
not really into talking.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.296
Okay.

06:16.478 --> 06:18.495
Thanks for being so honest.

06:18.754 --> 06:19.954
Grace!

06:22.625 --> 06:24.491
What are you doing down there?

06:24.493 --> 06:25.770
It's not how I planned it.

06:25.770 --> 06:26.994
Cliff.

06:26.995 --> 06:28.695
It's been in my family a long time.

06:32.048 --> 06:34.949
I'd like you to be in my
family a long time, too.

06:36.305 --> 06:37.871
It's you.

06:37.873 --> 06:39.698
It's always been you.

06:39.942 --> 06:42.109
Will always be you.

06:43.312 --> 06:45.345
I love you.

06:46.715 --> 06:49.187
So, Grace, will you marry me?

07:02.915 --> 07:04.531
Do you need some help?

07:04.533 --> 07:05.946
Nah, I...

07:06.593 --> 07:07.993
But if you keep talking to me,

07:07.994 --> 07:09.603
I'll gladly flatten my tire again.

07:09.605 --> 07:11.373
Cute.

07:11.374 --> 07:13.173
Thank you. My mom thinks I am.

07:13.175 --> 07:15.208
I didn't mean... Oh...

07:15.210 --> 07:16.953
- Never mind.
- I'm new in town.

07:16.953 --> 07:18.862
- I know.
- How?

07:18.862 --> 07:21.381
Well, the socks gave you away.

07:25.104 --> 07:26.587
Is there anything else I need to know

07:26.587 --> 07:27.904
to pass as a native?

07:27.904 --> 07:30.864
Well, you could think
about ditching the socks,

07:31.335 --> 07:34.728
but... either way, welcome to Cedar Cove.

07:41.722 --> 07:43.270
- There ya go.
- Thank you!

07:43.622 --> 07:45.205
Uh, Moon, wait. Um...

07:45.569 --> 07:46.931
As you know,

07:46.932 --> 07:48.630
we had some crazy weather last year

07:48.630 --> 07:50.113
and it really hurt the local fishermen.

07:50.113 --> 07:52.091
Yeah. Yeah, weather will do that to you.

07:52.091 --> 07:54.331
Unless, of course, you
choose to work inside,

07:54.333 --> 07:55.716
which is one of the many reasons

07:55.718 --> 07:58.030
why I never made the salty sea my mistress.

07:58.049 --> 07:58.941
Good point!

07:58.942 --> 08:01.210
So, what do you think
about a huge fundraiser

08:01.211 --> 08:02.723
for them down at the beach?

08:02.725 --> 08:04.765
Ah, that sounds like a
good cause. I'm there.

08:04.765 --> 08:07.362
- How about sponsoring it?
- Sure, I'll donate some side dishes

08:07.363 --> 08:09.997
- or something.
- Maybe a little more than that?

08:11.538 --> 08:14.084
Just, uh... how much more?

08:14.086 --> 08:15.293
A lot more.

08:15.293 --> 08:16.570
All more, all of it.

08:16.572 --> 08:18.046
Food, decorations, servers.

08:18.046 --> 08:19.740
Whoa! Whoa, Peggy.

08:19.742 --> 08:22.576
It's for the fishermen, Moon, who need us,

08:22.578 --> 08:23.778
and we need them.

08:23.779 --> 08:25.312
That's how small communities work.

08:25.314 --> 08:28.590
Small communities work by
bankrupting my business?

08:28.590 --> 08:31.349
You and I both know you can afford it.

08:31.349 --> 08:32.736
That is something

08:32.738 --> 08:34.989
that I would rather the
whole world didn't know.

08:34.989 --> 08:37.107
- Why?
- So people won't come by

08:37.109 --> 08:39.751
- asking me to fund fundraisers.
- Oh!

08:39.753 --> 08:42.328
You said it yourself. It's a good cause.

08:42.331 --> 08:44.536
Yeah, that was before I was
paying for the whole thing.

08:44.987 --> 08:46.366
Okay, look.

08:46.368 --> 08:49.136
Let's say I throw this, ah,
benefit for the fishermen.

08:49.138 --> 08:51.138
Who's going to throw
the benefit for me, huh?

08:51.139 --> 08:53.573
Just think about it, okay?

08:54.476 --> 08:55.842
Please?

09:06.455 --> 09:07.738
Hey, stranger.

09:07.740 --> 09:09.056
Mm.

09:09.058 --> 09:10.963
I haven't seen you around here in a while.

09:10.963 --> 09:12.706
Yeah. I've been busy.

09:12.825 --> 09:15.202
Started to get the feeling
you were avoiding meetings...

09:15.325 --> 09:16.530
and me.

09:16.532 --> 09:18.307
No, no, not at all.

09:18.308 --> 09:21.001
It's just, um, I've got a lot of work.

09:21.003 --> 09:22.798
You know, Seattle...

09:23.806 --> 09:25.772
Are you sure that's all it is?

09:26.683 --> 09:29.443
I'm your sponsor, Jack. You
can talk to me, you know?

09:30.078 --> 09:31.373
Yeah.

09:31.401 --> 09:34.347
You're sure that there isn't
something you need to tell me?

09:34.349 --> 09:36.553
No. No. Nothing.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Those new brushes are great.

09:44.593 --> 09:46.059
Just look at his coat.

09:50.152 --> 09:51.985
What do you say we do both of us a favor

09:51.986 --> 09:53.405
and clear the air?

09:54.000 --> 09:57.087
I'm flattered, but there can't be
anything between us. You know I love Grace.

09:57.088 --> 09:58.587
Yes, I do.

09:59.675 --> 10:01.742
So, I'll finish out the week and move on.

10:01.744 --> 10:03.233
Whoa, no need to quit.

10:03.233 --> 10:04.911
You are so sweet.

10:05.214 --> 10:08.815
This is why... I like you so much.

10:08.817 --> 10:11.267
You're the best ranch hand
I've had in years and...

10:11.267 --> 10:13.487
I called a friend, a great guy.

10:13.489 --> 10:14.955
Cal Pattenson.

10:14.957 --> 10:17.657
He's in between jobs, he'd be perfect.

10:17.659 --> 10:19.793
- You don't have to do this.
- I do.

10:19.795 --> 10:21.094
For me.

10:22.765 --> 10:24.314
I think it'll be good for me

10:24.316 --> 10:26.205
to get away from the cowboys for a while.

10:27.603 --> 10:28.936
Tch-tch.

10:39.615 --> 10:40.960
Hey!

10:40.960 --> 10:42.249
Hi!

10:43.102 --> 10:44.751
Oh! Thanks.

10:47.322 --> 10:48.588
So...

10:49.317 --> 10:50.524
I'm engaged.

10:50.526 --> 10:51.892
Cliff asked you to marry him?

10:51.894 --> 10:53.226
Yes! He did.

10:53.228 --> 10:55.463
- Where's the ring?
- Oh. Here.

10:59.334 --> 11:01.968
Oh, Grace. It's beautiful.

11:01.970 --> 11:03.444
I know.

11:03.605 --> 11:05.368
It's been a while since
I've been engaged, but I'm

11:05.369 --> 11:07.395
pretty sure that goes on your finger.

11:07.436 --> 11:08.642
Not yet.

11:08.644 --> 11:09.943
So you're not engaged?

11:09.945 --> 11:12.245
Well, I will be, when I'm ready.

11:12.247 --> 11:13.647
You're not ready?

11:13.649 --> 11:15.148
And Cliff's okay with this?

11:15.150 --> 11:16.917
Cliff said, as far as he's concerned,

11:16.919 --> 11:18.151
he's engaged,

11:18.153 --> 11:20.045
and when he sees this ring on my finger,

11:20.045 --> 11:22.195
he will know that I am ready
and we will set the date

11:22.195 --> 11:23.436
and you will wear an ugly dress

11:23.436 --> 11:25.441
and stand up there beside
me while I get married...

11:25.442 --> 11:26.642
again.

11:27.059 --> 11:28.543
Oh, wow!

11:28.544 --> 11:30.189
- This is big!
- I know.

11:30.294 --> 11:32.619
Is the pause in accepting because of Alex?

11:32.781 --> 11:34.075
And me.

11:34.268 --> 11:36.099
Have you ever really wanted something

11:36.099 --> 11:38.370
and then, as soon as you get it,

11:38.370 --> 11:40.199
you're... you're just not so sure?

11:40.199 --> 11:41.576
You're not sure you want Cliff?

11:41.576 --> 11:43.039
Oh, no. I do want him.

11:43.178 --> 11:44.895
I love him.

11:44.897 --> 11:46.530
It's just this whole marriage thing.

11:46.532 --> 11:48.348
I mean, do I really want
to get married again?

11:48.350 --> 11:50.582
Do I really need to get married again?

11:50.643 --> 11:53.159
Then why'd you accept the ring?

11:54.320 --> 11:56.955
Because I think, for Cliff,
this'll be a deal-breaker.

11:57.604 --> 11:59.461
We don't get married,
we don't move forward,

11:59.461 --> 12:01.828
I think we might just come to a full stop.

12:01.930 --> 12:04.908
You can't marry someone just
because you don't want to lose them.

12:04.908 --> 12:06.337
I know.

12:08.649 --> 12:11.022
If you'd just sign your statement

12:11.023 --> 12:12.634
right there, please.

12:18.703 --> 12:20.113
You owe your friend.

12:20.271 --> 12:23.183
If she hadn't been harassing my office 24/7

12:23.185 --> 12:26.186
to look into what was going
on with your disappearance...

12:26.188 --> 12:27.888
she probably saved your life.

12:33.107 --> 12:34.356
Relax! Okay?

12:34.357 --> 12:37.108
Listen. Your investment is totally sound.

12:37.109 --> 12:39.765
In fact, I'm going to be heading
back to Cedar Cove real soon,

12:39.765 --> 12:41.631
and when I do, I'm gonna
straighten this whole thing out,

12:41.631 --> 12:43.465
and it'll be back to business as usual.

12:44.612 --> 12:46.217
You have my word on it.

12:51.765 --> 12:52.965
Your Honor,

12:52.970 --> 12:55.515
we had a non-refundable
per-plate charge.

12:55.517 --> 12:57.998
There was entertainment, a goodie bag.

12:58.253 --> 13:00.253
They RSVP'd "yes" and then did not show,

13:00.255 --> 13:02.088
which meant I was out
of pocket for the money

13:02.091 --> 13:04.139
to cover for their rude behavior.

13:04.140 --> 13:06.669
We didn't write it down.
We forgot. We're human.

13:06.670 --> 13:08.525
This lawsuit's over a birthday party?

13:08.525 --> 13:10.230
A child's birthday party?

13:10.232 --> 13:13.180
Our party planner is known
for her theme parties.

13:13.180 --> 13:15.402
- Party planner?
- It was quite the coup to land her.

13:15.404 --> 13:16.817
We had a family emergency.

13:16.817 --> 13:18.087
You just said you forgot.

13:18.707 --> 13:19.941
Which is it?

13:19.941 --> 13:22.248
- Do I have to tell you?
- Seeing as I am the judge

13:22.249 --> 13:25.345
and this is my court... yes.

13:25.578 --> 13:26.778
Playoff tickets.

13:27.490 --> 13:29.015
I got playoff tickets.

13:29.017 --> 13:31.511
Did either of you try to talk this out

13:31.511 --> 13:33.539
- before you came in here?
- Mm-mm. No.

13:33.539 --> 13:35.201
- No.
- When neighbors

13:35.201 --> 13:37.691
have a non-criminal
problem with their children,

13:37.693 --> 13:40.527
they talk about it like adults.

13:40.529 --> 13:42.876
Preferably over a nice dinner...

13:42.876 --> 13:44.584
maybe a barbecue.

13:45.031 --> 13:47.952
Which I hereby sentence you
to have within the next week.

13:47.953 --> 13:50.421
And I sentence you to bring dessert.

13:50.421 --> 13:52.643
- But, Your Honor...
- Case dismissed.

13:53.988 --> 13:56.083
And I want to see pictures of that dinner.

14:09.466 --> 14:10.949
The hat and sunglasses

14:10.951 --> 14:12.964
just make you look even more suspicious.

14:12.965 --> 14:14.517
Hey!

14:14.517 --> 14:16.665
The boy genius.

14:16.873 --> 14:19.908
You know, Eric, I have to
admit, I underestimated you.

14:20.368 --> 14:21.998
I did. I mean, look. You outsmarted Dick,

14:21.998 --> 14:23.609
you outsmarted the Feds.

14:24.238 --> 14:25.747
I was wrong.

14:25.749 --> 14:28.255
You do have more than
a room temperature I.Q.

14:28.255 --> 14:29.833
- We need to talk.
- No, we don't.

14:29.833 --> 14:31.980
You're fired, and there's no
severance, by the way. So bye-bye.

14:31.981 --> 14:33.942
- You're unbelievable.
- Yes. I am.

14:33.942 --> 14:35.190
That wasn't a compliment.

14:35.192 --> 14:36.751
Okay. Fine.

14:36.751 --> 14:38.721
Let's talk. You're obviously upset.

14:38.721 --> 14:40.980
Yes, I am upset because
you almost got me killed.

14:40.980 --> 14:42.379
"Almost" doesn't count.

14:42.379 --> 14:45.107
And for your information, I wasn't
the one who almost tried to kill you.

14:45.107 --> 14:47.268
That was Dick. Remember?

14:47.270 --> 14:50.405
Look, kid, they say that when
you sit down at a poker table,

14:50.407 --> 14:52.340
if you can't pick out who the patsy is

14:52.342 --> 14:54.609
in the first 10 minutes, you're the patsy.

14:54.611 --> 14:56.077
You see, that's you, Eric.

14:56.079 --> 14:57.328
You're the patsy.

14:57.546 --> 14:59.447
Oh. And first rule of business...

14:59.449 --> 15:00.773
trust no one.

15:01.918 --> 15:03.228
I don't.

15:12.922 --> 15:14.755
Daddy's home.

15:14.971 --> 15:17.217
I wish you would've let
me pay for breakfast.

15:17.217 --> 15:20.064
I'm just not comfortable with the
idea of taking your mother's money.

15:20.064 --> 15:21.281
What?

15:21.282 --> 15:23.128
Well, you haven't had a job in a while.

15:23.757 --> 15:25.623
Well, I mean, I'm not...
I'm not judging you.

15:25.624 --> 15:28.043
- I think you are.
- No, I'm not. Really.

15:28.045 --> 15:29.420
It's just that you're comfortable with

15:29.421 --> 15:31.072
the idea of getting help from your parents,

15:31.072 --> 15:33.570
and... well, I'm not.

15:36.952 --> 15:39.182
I am so happy to be back in Cedar Cove.

15:39.364 --> 15:41.082
I mean, the health clinic has a doctor, but

15:41.083 --> 15:43.043
they also need a physician's assistant.

15:43.895 --> 15:45.828
And my hair is on fire.

15:45.830 --> 15:47.062
Mm-hmm.

15:47.594 --> 15:49.915
- What?
- Dad, where are you?

15:49.917 --> 15:51.400
Because you're not here.

15:51.402 --> 15:52.635
You okay?

15:52.637 --> 15:54.520
I-I couldn't be better.

15:54.709 --> 15:56.155
Ah, Linnette...

15:56.155 --> 15:58.591
I'm fine.

15:58.593 --> 16:00.009
So...

16:00.011 --> 16:01.723
excited about the new job?

16:01.996 --> 16:04.025
Little scared.

16:04.025 --> 16:05.701
It's a lot of responsibility.

16:05.701 --> 16:07.551
I mean, I'm not technically a doctor,

16:07.551 --> 16:08.913
but I can write prescriptions

16:08.914 --> 16:13.317
- and I can perform a lot of procedures.
- Well, congratulations, Dr. McAfee.

16:13.317 --> 16:14.567
In a couple of years,
if I go back to school.

16:14.568 --> 16:16.998
Right now, I'm happy to be "P.A." McAfee.

16:16.998 --> 16:18.198
I got it.

16:18.414 --> 16:19.970
She's already got a job.

16:21.267 --> 16:22.900
Oh, don't let me chase you out.

16:22.901 --> 16:24.315
Oh, no, no. I have to go.

16:24.316 --> 16:26.415
One of the roommates dropped out
of the house that we're renting,

16:26.415 --> 16:28.587
so I'm gonna go meet a
couple potential replacements.

16:28.588 --> 16:29.932
Ahh. You already got a place?

16:29.932 --> 16:31.407
The house at Palmer and Smith.

16:31.409 --> 16:32.719
Ooh. That's a big house.

16:32.719 --> 16:33.863
- Yeah.
- Expensive.

16:33.863 --> 16:35.110
That's why we need another roommate.

16:35.112 --> 16:37.767
Well, don't look at me.
Peggy wouldn't like it.

16:40.785 --> 16:42.477
Bye, Dad.

16:42.687 --> 16:44.548
Physician's assistant...

16:44.548 --> 16:47.449
I remember when she was
selling Girl Scout cookies.

16:48.738 --> 16:50.195
Roy, what's wrong?

16:51.838 --> 16:54.526
Nothing. Everything's fine, why do you ask?

16:54.746 --> 16:56.765
Mm. I've known you a very long time.

16:57.835 --> 16:59.864
- All's good.
- Yeah?

16:59.971 --> 17:02.738
Corrie's waiting for me at home. Um...

17:03.224 --> 17:04.617
I should go.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.387
You shouldn't have come.

17:14.387 --> 17:15.968
It's too soon.

17:18.155 --> 17:20.089
I know that you're angry.

17:20.090 --> 17:21.416
I'm not angry.

17:21.417 --> 17:23.792
I'm just really, really disappointed.

17:24.762 --> 17:27.162
Well... no.

17:27.641 --> 17:29.398
Maybe I'm still angry.

17:29.400 --> 17:31.030
The longer that we don't talk, I just...

17:31.031 --> 17:34.236
I can't get through this emotional
hurricane that you put me in

17:34.238 --> 17:35.638
faster

17:35.640 --> 17:38.348
just because you want to feel comfortable.

17:38.349 --> 17:40.509
All right, look. I, uh...

17:40.511 --> 17:42.811
I've been under a lot of pressure.

17:42.813 --> 17:44.997
Okay? And I just, um...

17:48.133 --> 17:50.219
Okay. No excuses.

17:50.689 --> 17:52.054
I just did it.

17:53.457 --> 17:55.457
I thought that I could handle it.

17:55.459 --> 17:57.660
I thought that I was handling it.

17:58.080 --> 18:00.215
And then you walked in the door,

18:00.293 --> 18:03.118
and I saw the look on your face and, uh...

18:06.671 --> 18:08.737
I knew that I was lying to myself.

18:08.739 --> 18:10.205
And me.

18:10.207 --> 18:11.702
Yes.

18:14.278 --> 18:16.128
I can appreciate

18:16.130 --> 18:18.347
that you want things to get back to normal,

18:18.349 --> 18:20.149
but, um...

18:20.151 --> 18:23.085
what I thought was our "normal"

18:23.087 --> 18:24.920
was a lie.

18:24.922 --> 18:27.323
Don't let one mistake ruin what we have.

18:28.809 --> 18:30.708
I'm at work.

18:31.545 --> 18:33.175
This is not the place.

18:35.153 --> 18:37.656
Can I call you later?

18:40.237 --> 18:41.437
No.

18:42.773 --> 18:45.674
Just give me some space.

18:46.911 --> 18:48.477
I love you.

18:49.274 --> 18:50.479
I know.

18:50.481 --> 18:52.381
And I love you.

18:53.049 --> 18:54.256
I just...

18:54.452 --> 18:56.418
don't forgive you.

18:56.420 --> 18:58.404
Not yet.

19:08.206 --> 19:10.368
So sorry to keep you waiting.

19:11.076 --> 19:12.909
What did you need to talk about?

19:13.275 --> 19:14.777
I'm pregnant.

19:14.779 --> 19:16.246
Congratulations.

19:16.248 --> 19:18.503
- Thanks.
- Does Ian know?

19:18.503 --> 19:20.016
Now he does.

19:20.209 --> 19:21.455
Before he shipped out?

19:21.455 --> 19:24.676
I tried to contact him,
but I couldn't get through.

19:24.676 --> 19:26.723
I think he was avoiding me.

19:26.725 --> 19:28.416
Luke e-mailed him

19:28.416 --> 19:30.277
and sent this back to me.

19:34.916 --> 19:37.166
Well, this looks all right.

19:37.168 --> 19:39.402
He'll be there for you and the baby.

19:39.404 --> 19:40.604
Keep reading.

19:43.375 --> 19:45.475
He still wants a divorce.

19:45.477 --> 19:47.207
Oh, Cecilia.

19:47.207 --> 19:49.913
Please, Olivia, you've got to help me.

19:49.915 --> 19:51.653
I'm not a marriage counselor.

19:51.677 --> 19:53.683
You saved us the last time.

19:53.685 --> 19:56.869
No, honey. That was you.
You and Ian did that.

19:57.135 --> 19:59.982
But we couldn't have done it
without you showing us the way.

20:00.390 --> 20:02.025
I need you.

20:02.027 --> 20:03.494
We all do...

20:04.296 --> 20:06.930
me, Ian, and my baby.

20:11.769 --> 20:14.137
- Hello, Grace.
- Hey, Bob!

20:14.139 --> 20:16.873
I brought coffee and a muffin.

20:16.875 --> 20:18.169
Ahh.

20:18.229 --> 20:19.776
I know that tone.

20:19.778 --> 20:21.377
You need a favor,

20:21.379 --> 20:23.346
but the muffin is a very nice touch.

20:26.551 --> 20:28.935
Moon? I need an answer.

20:28.937 --> 20:30.453
The Town Council's waiting,

20:30.455 --> 20:32.322
and there are so many plans to be made.

20:32.712 --> 20:35.658
I used to have this pretty
little dog named Penny,

20:35.660 --> 20:37.560
and every time she
wanted something from me,

20:37.562 --> 20:39.635
she gave me a look just like that one.

20:39.635 --> 20:41.999
- Did it work?
- Every single time.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Thank you! Thank you!

20:44.002 --> 20:45.234
But...

20:45.236 --> 20:46.402
we keep it basic.

20:46.404 --> 20:48.671
Nothing like lobsters
or anything like that.

20:48.673 --> 20:49.806
Lobsters?

20:49.808 --> 20:51.674
Moon! That's terrific!

20:51.676 --> 20:54.444
This is the Pacific Northwest.
We don't have lobsters.

20:54.446 --> 20:56.212
But I will find you lobsters.

20:56.214 --> 20:57.947
What a great idea!

20:57.949 --> 21:00.786
We can raise ticket prices, and it's
a great tie-in with the fishermen.

21:00.786 --> 21:03.354
- Not with our fishermen.
- Everyone loves lobster.

21:03.355 --> 21:04.787
It'll be so special.

21:04.789 --> 21:06.005
Thank you, Moon!

21:06.007 --> 21:07.657
I'm gonna send out an email blast.

21:07.659 --> 21:09.626
Moon, I promise.

21:09.628 --> 21:12.128
I will get every person
in town to this event.

21:20.372 --> 21:22.705
You want me to be the Town Manager?

21:22.707 --> 21:24.482
- Cedar Cove needs you.
- Me?

21:24.483 --> 21:25.787
Yes, that's why I'm here.

21:27.776 --> 21:30.976
We... we already have
a Town Manager. Norman.

21:30.976 --> 21:32.448
Retiring.

21:32.450 --> 21:34.851
So, as the head of the Town Council,

21:34.853 --> 21:36.967
I'm offering you the job.

21:37.088 --> 21:38.955
Now, it doesn't come with any pay,

21:38.957 --> 21:40.757
but the satisfaction

21:40.759 --> 21:42.317
of serving your community.

21:42.805 --> 21:45.144
I don't know anything about politics.

21:45.146 --> 21:46.561
Ah, it's not a political position.

21:46.561 --> 21:48.565
I've never been to a Town Council meeting.

21:48.565 --> 21:51.543
- They're boring!
- I didn't vote at last year's election.

21:51.543 --> 21:54.303
Well, you should vote.
It's your civic duty.

21:54.305 --> 21:56.318
That doesn't matter.

21:57.342 --> 21:59.876
You're the most honest
person I know, Grace.

21:59.878 --> 22:03.980
This library runs like
a well-oiled machine.

22:03.982 --> 22:05.615
Because of you.

22:05.617 --> 22:08.051
Everyone in town loves and respects you,

22:08.072 --> 22:09.438
and you're a born leader!

22:09.633 --> 22:11.471
I could say the same thing about you.

22:11.473 --> 22:13.383
That's why I'm the head
of the Town Council.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.444
But this position's all about you.

22:17.444 --> 22:19.992
- Oh...
- It's your turn.

22:20.732 --> 22:23.363
It's your year. It's the year of Grace!

22:24.586 --> 22:25.859
"The year of Grace"?

22:25.860 --> 22:27.789
- Yes, it is.
- Oh. Huh.

22:27.972 --> 22:30.219
Are you gonna eat that?

22:33.311 --> 22:35.584
Go on.

22:35.585 --> 22:36.785
Hmm.

22:43.413 --> 22:45.212
- Hi there.
- Hey.

22:45.212 --> 22:46.756
You looking for a place to live?

22:46.758 --> 22:48.883
- Maybe.
- Well...

22:53.140 --> 22:54.409
There's my number.

22:54.720 --> 22:56.299
It's a really great place.

22:56.301 --> 22:57.501
Thanks.

22:59.492 --> 23:01.660
I do depend on my parents
too much financially.

23:01.660 --> 23:03.172
I need to be on my own.

23:03.174 --> 23:04.774
I'm going to move out.

23:04.776 --> 23:06.727
- How will you afford it?
- I'll get a job,

23:06.728 --> 23:08.809
a real job that I can
do while I go to school.

23:08.809 --> 23:10.546
You don't need to turn
away help from your parents

23:10.548 --> 23:11.829
just because of what I said.

23:11.829 --> 23:13.362
I want to do this.

23:13.836 --> 23:15.703
Thanks for helping me see that.

23:16.988 --> 23:19.397
- What?
- I'm going to have to tell my mother.

23:19.397 --> 23:22.091
Yeah, she's probably going
to notice you're not there.

23:30.623 --> 23:32.810
Judge Lockhart. Did you hear?

23:32.810 --> 23:35.538
- Hear what?
- Anthony took a leave of absence.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.273
Yes. I know. He called me.

23:37.275 --> 23:39.317
His father has to have
surgery in Philadelphia.

23:39.317 --> 23:41.639
- There's a new D.A.
- Paul Watson.

23:41.639 --> 23:43.746
- What do you know?
- I know

23:43.748 --> 23:45.414
that if you want to know
something about the new D.A.,

23:45.416 --> 23:46.624
you need to ask him.

23:46.624 --> 23:48.586
- Have you met him?
- No.

23:48.899 --> 23:50.720
I can't lose my job.

23:50.722 --> 23:52.698
I think you're overreacting.

23:52.698 --> 23:54.576
New D.A.s like to clean house,

23:54.576 --> 23:57.059
and what with my past...
lying on my resume...

23:57.061 --> 23:59.896
maybe he won't be as
lenient as the last one.

24:00.585 --> 24:03.166
Maybe you can put in a good word for me?

24:03.168 --> 24:05.048
I think you'll do just fine,

24:05.048 --> 24:06.736
if you stop obstructing justice.

24:06.738 --> 24:09.272
- What do you mean?
- You're delaying that judge.

24:09.274 --> 24:10.799
But that's not obstr...

24:11.049 --> 24:13.305
Oh, right, a joke.

24:19.267 --> 24:21.616
Oh! I'm sorry!

24:21.616 --> 24:23.565
I didn't splash you, did I?

24:23.565 --> 24:24.854
No. No damage.

24:24.856 --> 24:26.115
Okay.

24:26.391 --> 24:28.379
Wait. I... I know you.

24:28.379 --> 24:30.523
So much for being anonymous.

24:30.523 --> 24:32.248
We met at Cliff's.

24:32.347 --> 24:34.600
That's right. I was out there with Olivia.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.232
The judge. Your girlfriend.

24:36.234 --> 24:39.229
Mm. You look... different, somehow.

24:39.371 --> 24:41.170
I decided to cut my hair.

24:41.424 --> 24:43.739
Changing up some things in my life.

24:43.741 --> 24:47.310
I see. I haven't seen you here, have I?

24:47.312 --> 24:48.578
No.

24:48.580 --> 24:50.475
So...

24:50.648 --> 24:52.615
horses drove you to drink?

24:54.085 --> 24:56.419
- Wall Street.
- Ah.

24:56.421 --> 24:58.640
- Yeah.
- And the horses?

24:58.640 --> 25:00.204
I grew up on a horse farm.

25:00.204 --> 25:01.858
I wasn't prepared for the pressure

25:01.858 --> 25:03.849
- of the city and the job.
- Ah.

25:03.849 --> 25:05.343
I realized I'm a lot more comfortable

25:05.343 --> 25:06.963
on a horse farm than a subway.

25:06.965 --> 25:08.167
Right.

25:08.168 --> 25:11.099
And there were a couple
of bad choices with men.

25:11.537 --> 25:13.603
Well, we all have those.

25:13.603 --> 25:15.671
I mean, you know, me with women,

25:15.673 --> 25:18.374
but, uh, not Olivia, but, uh...

25:18.376 --> 25:20.535
How did you end up here?
You don't seem like a native.

25:20.535 --> 25:22.472
That's a long story. Ah...

25:22.573 --> 25:24.697
I've got a lot of time
on my hands at the moment,

25:24.697 --> 25:26.078
and no job.

25:26.290 --> 25:28.150
You want to grab a coffee?

25:28.152 --> 25:29.886
I promise not to spill it on you, and, um,

25:29.888 --> 25:31.053
my treat.

25:31.055 --> 25:32.555
- Sure.
- Yeah?

25:32.557 --> 25:34.306
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

25:37.450 --> 25:38.877
Eric?

25:38.877 --> 25:40.077
Yeah?

25:40.078 --> 25:41.649
What happened? Are you okay?

25:41.650 --> 25:44.697
Oh, this? Ah, that's a long story.

25:45.448 --> 25:46.702
Where's Adele?

25:46.702 --> 25:47.986
She's with my aunt.

25:48.349 --> 25:51.647
I got your text about
moving back in with your dad.

25:51.943 --> 25:53.876
And then I saw you on the news.

25:54.749 --> 25:55.970
What's going on, Shelly?

25:55.970 --> 25:57.780
Well, the accounting firm
that I've been working for,

25:57.780 --> 25:59.749
they've just... they've
offered me a new job,

25:59.751 --> 26:01.323
and it's a lot more money,

26:01.323 --> 26:02.822
401K,

26:02.823 --> 26:04.356
a relocation fee.

26:04.356 --> 26:06.321
- Relocation?
- It's in Oklahoma.

26:06.488 --> 26:07.689
Oklahoma?

26:07.690 --> 26:09.777
And I'm gonna need your permission
to take Adele out of state.

26:09.777 --> 26:11.057
It's just a couple papers

26:11.058 --> 26:14.263
- that you're gonna need to sign...
- Whoa! What're you saying here?

26:14.265 --> 26:16.933
You... You just expect
me to give up my daughter?

26:16.935 --> 26:18.334
I don't want to make trouble.

26:18.334 --> 26:19.706
How is this not trouble?

26:19.706 --> 26:22.384
I am taking Adele with me,
and if I have to go to court,

26:22.385 --> 26:24.670
my lawyer is going to use
everything that we've got

26:24.670 --> 26:26.242
to get me full custody.

26:26.244 --> 26:27.510
- What?
- Look, Eric.

26:27.512 --> 26:29.145
According to the news,

26:29.147 --> 26:31.044
you were working for a criminal,

26:31.044 --> 26:34.008
you were the target of
an FBI investigation,

26:34.008 --> 26:35.698
and now you're unemployed

26:35.698 --> 26:38.502
and living back with your
dad, who's drinking again.

26:40.231 --> 26:42.706
I ran into him at the ferry, a while back.

26:42.710 --> 26:44.994
- He's sober.
- He's drinking again.

26:44.996 --> 26:46.930
And my lawyer will tell the court

26:46.930 --> 26:48.464
that your life in Cedar Cove is unstable,

26:48.464 --> 26:50.408
and that having Adele around someone

26:50.408 --> 26:52.131
with a drinking problem...

26:52.793 --> 26:54.963
I really don't want to hurt you.

26:54.964 --> 26:57.707
No, you just want to take my child away.

27:07.077 --> 27:09.810
You know, if you're a cop, pal,
you'd better have yourself a warrant.

27:09.812 --> 27:11.729
You know, forget about the warrant.
Get yourself out of my chair.

27:11.729 --> 27:14.252
I'm not a cop, but I'm
guessing right about now,

27:14.252 --> 27:15.901
you're wishing I were.

27:17.003 --> 27:18.618
And if I'm not mistaken, it's my chair,

27:18.618 --> 27:19.996
just like it's my building.

27:19.996 --> 27:21.356
Go home.

27:21.356 --> 27:23.763
I got news for you... until
this mess with Saget Development

27:23.763 --> 27:25.751
is cleaned up, Cedar Cove is my home.

27:25.751 --> 27:27.140
There is no mess, all right?

27:27.140 --> 27:29.964
- And all the charges were dropped.
- Because I got them dropped.

27:30.101 --> 27:31.763
And when these things hit the front page,

27:31.764 --> 27:34.544
there is always a mess, no
matter what the end result.

27:35.129 --> 27:36.662
It's bad for the company,

27:36.663 --> 27:40.557
and as its largest
investor, I don't like it.

27:40.557 --> 27:42.964
Well, you'll be happy to know
they can't come after me again.

27:42.964 --> 27:44.946
- But I can.
- Buck, look... I...

27:44.948 --> 27:46.882
You made the Feds look
bad. They don't like that.

27:46.882 --> 27:48.094
Trust me. They'll be back.

27:48.094 --> 27:49.583
Look, Dad, seriously.

27:50.416 --> 27:52.974
- Go.
- You know, you haven't changed.

27:53.117 --> 27:54.372
Not since you were six

27:54.374 --> 27:56.421
and I caught you stealing the
loose change off my bureau.

27:56.421 --> 27:58.526
You can't be trusted. You never could.

27:58.528 --> 28:00.146
Therefore, as of today,

28:00.146 --> 28:03.335
I am exercising my privilege
as majority stockholder

28:03.335 --> 28:05.680
- and taking over the company.
- That's never gonna happen.

28:06.957 --> 28:08.158
Ever.

28:11.395 --> 28:12.876
I know you.

28:13.907 --> 28:15.739
Better than anyone else.

28:16.223 --> 28:18.609
I know what makes you tick,
I know what buttons to push,

28:18.609 --> 28:19.880
and most importantly...

28:19.882 --> 28:21.646
I know what scares you.

28:22.369 --> 28:24.474
You go to war with me, you're gonna lose.

28:24.554 --> 28:26.220
And we both know, family or not,

28:26.221 --> 28:27.761
I don't take prisoners...

28:28.559 --> 28:29.759
Junior.

28:40.889 --> 28:42.437
Where were you on Tuesday?

28:42.437 --> 28:43.664
Cedar Cove.

28:43.664 --> 28:45.172
You missed Barry's farewell luncheon.

28:45.174 --> 28:47.774
- Do you read your e-mails?
- Jeri, I gotta go.

28:47.774 --> 28:50.059
I would strongly suggest you
don't miss the welcome dinner

28:50.060 --> 28:51.546
for the new incoming editor.

28:51.547 --> 28:53.651
You don't want to get
off on the wrong foot.

28:53.951 --> 28:55.546
All right, send the info

28:55.546 --> 28:56.807
and I'll be there.

28:58.613 --> 29:00.245
Corrie can't know we talked.

29:00.245 --> 29:02.243
Keeping people's information confidential

29:02.243 --> 29:03.601
is something I'm pretty good at.

29:03.601 --> 29:06.085
I mean, what's upsetting
me, it concerns Corrie,

29:06.087 --> 29:07.629
but she can't know anything about it.

29:07.629 --> 29:08.829
Mm-hm.

29:08.830 --> 29:12.135
It's regarding something we
did before we were married.

29:12.860 --> 29:14.060
Something she did.

29:16.097 --> 29:18.790
Moon! You shouldn't have left
the council meeting early.

29:18.791 --> 29:20.740
Government buildings make me itchy.

29:20.741 --> 29:22.033
Oh! Why?

29:22.560 --> 29:24.350
You never heard of the '60s?

29:24.695 --> 29:26.753
Well, they approved everything.

29:26.753 --> 29:28.980
- They love it.
- Swell.

29:29.130 --> 29:31.369
But there's just one little, tiny hiccup.

29:31.369 --> 29:33.761
Seems the space at the beach
isn't available that day,

29:33.762 --> 29:36.099
so they want us to do
it on the 12th instead.

29:36.099 --> 29:39.235
- The 12th? Three days from now?
- Mm. I know.

29:39.237 --> 29:41.954
Peggy, this is a huge
hiccup. It gives me no time.

29:41.956 --> 29:43.384
Oh, well, just hire someone.

29:43.384 --> 29:44.657
And look!

29:44.659 --> 29:47.143
Voila! And these will
be all over the county.

29:47.144 --> 29:50.839
- And notice... "Sponsored by Moon's Cafe."
- That's great.

29:51.198 --> 29:53.135
So... how's our menu coming?

29:53.135 --> 29:56.389
Barbecued ribs, chicken,
coleslaw, potato salad.

29:56.389 --> 29:57.850
I told people lobster!

29:57.850 --> 30:00.925
You know, it was Henry
David Thoreau who said,

30:00.925 --> 30:03.645
"Our life is frittered away by detail.

30:03.645 --> 30:04.977
Simplify, simplify."

30:04.979 --> 30:06.879
Well, you know, Peggy, I'm
gonna take the man's advice...

30:06.881 --> 30:08.581
- ...And simplify my life.
- How?

30:08.583 --> 30:11.036
Well, I think maybe I'll start with, uh...

30:11.318 --> 30:12.756
no lobster.

30:12.757 --> 30:14.056
go from there.

30:21.843 --> 30:23.043
Hey.

30:24.719 --> 30:25.921
You okay?

30:25.922 --> 30:27.484
Get everything moved back all right?

30:27.485 --> 30:29.601
Shelly's taking Adele to Oklahoma.

30:29.602 --> 30:31.128
- She can't do that.
- She can.

30:31.128 --> 30:32.331
Thanks to you.

30:32.332 --> 30:34.055
- Me?
- You're drinking again?

30:34.055 --> 30:36.400
She said she caught you
a while back on the ferry.

30:37.501 --> 30:39.083
Is it true?

30:39.084 --> 30:41.094
What, Dad? Tell me it's not true.

30:41.219 --> 30:42.652
I slipped.

30:43.701 --> 30:44.950
But it's over now.

30:45.389 --> 30:48.962
She's got some lawyer who's gonna use
your slip-up to take my baby away from me.

30:56.487 --> 30:59.337
Well, I appreciate anything
you can do, Vice Admiral.

30:59.665 --> 31:01.108
Thank you.

31:01.947 --> 31:04.216
Vice Admiral Nielsen at the base.

31:04.217 --> 31:05.650
You enlisting?

31:05.651 --> 31:08.599
No, but after today, that's not a bad idea.

31:09.004 --> 31:10.710
I was calling about Ian.

31:10.712 --> 31:13.512
Cecilia's pregnant and Ian wants a divorce.

31:13.514 --> 31:15.014
No...

31:16.250 --> 31:19.096
Bob wants me to be the new Town Manager.

31:19.454 --> 31:21.845
Now, that's a good idea!

31:21.845 --> 31:23.088
- You think?
- Yeah!

31:23.088 --> 31:25.454
I didn't even ask him, though,
what a Town Manager does.

31:25.454 --> 31:28.472
Town Manager carries out the
decisions made by the Town Council,

31:28.472 --> 31:30.250
which means you'll be
involved in the budget

31:30.250 --> 31:32.068
and supervising most departments.

31:32.068 --> 31:34.579
Why do you always know everything?

31:34.579 --> 31:36.869
Sorry.

31:36.871 --> 31:40.272
He says it's my year.
It's the year of Grace.

31:40.274 --> 31:42.308
I think I agree.

31:44.379 --> 31:46.848
Cecilia knows that you cannot

31:46.848 --> 31:49.415
- save her marriage, right?
- Yeah.

31:49.415 --> 31:51.817
And you know you can't
save her marriage, right?

31:51.819 --> 31:53.158
Of course.

31:54.503 --> 31:56.417
What?

31:56.486 --> 31:59.111
Well, there are some
things that can be saved.

31:59.111 --> 32:00.626
Like Jack.

32:00.628 --> 32:03.810
Not every relationship is a sinking ship.

32:03.810 --> 32:06.265
I'm just trying to help Cecilia,

32:06.706 --> 32:08.515
end of story.

32:09.203 --> 32:11.871
- You want a hug?
- Yeah.

32:13.989 --> 32:15.923
Aww.

32:17.712 --> 32:19.174
Want a lift home?

32:19.174 --> 32:20.374
I rode my bike.

32:21.299 --> 32:23.662
- Fresh air will do you good.
- Yeah.

32:30.761 --> 32:32.040
Jack.

32:32.040 --> 32:34.184
Don't punish Eric because of my mistake.

32:35.830 --> 32:37.030
I'm not drinking.

32:37.965 --> 32:39.598
Shelly, he's a good dad.

32:39.598 --> 32:41.398
This job in Oklahoma

32:41.398 --> 32:42.737
will let me take care of Adele

32:42.737 --> 32:44.867
in a way that will make her life better.

32:44.868 --> 32:46.635
It's the best thing for her.

32:46.635 --> 32:48.082
And what about Eric?

32:48.369 --> 32:50.521
- This isn't about Eric.
- Yes, it is.

32:50.521 --> 32:51.775
He's her father.

32:51.775 --> 32:53.408
Then he should do what's best

32:53.410 --> 32:55.043
and let me take her with me.

33:07.290 --> 33:09.057
Nice and private.

33:09.059 --> 33:11.520
Aww, and you've got my
drink waiting for me.

33:11.895 --> 33:14.329
You think a good scotch
is gonna soften me up?

33:14.331 --> 33:16.062
Obviously, we got off on the wrong foot.

33:16.062 --> 33:17.399
Since birth.

33:17.401 --> 33:19.294
I would like to try to
work things out, Dad.

33:19.294 --> 33:20.544
You want me to leave.

33:20.545 --> 33:22.379
No, I want you to let me
do what I do best, Dad,

33:22.379 --> 33:24.916
- and that is run this business. No.
- You mean my business.

33:24.917 --> 33:26.987
I am still the president of this company.

33:26.987 --> 33:28.743
Yeah. For now.

33:28.745 --> 33:30.069
For now.

33:39.037 --> 33:40.510
You want to move out?

33:40.510 --> 33:42.665
My living with you was only
supposed to be temporary.

33:42.666 --> 33:44.881
- Okay.
- Okay?

33:44.881 --> 33:46.738
Well, you're a grown woman.

33:46.738 --> 33:48.781
You deserve to have your own place.

33:49.149 --> 33:51.549
I can't wait to see it.

34:00.534 --> 34:02.174
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:02.174 --> 34:04.012
- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

34:04.014 --> 34:06.369
- Here about the ad.
- Are you a mechanic?

34:07.089 --> 34:09.083
The engine on this boat's
older than both of us.

34:09.083 --> 34:10.799
Yeah, my father had one just like this.

34:10.799 --> 34:12.286
Broke down all the time.

34:12.504 --> 34:14.222
So I got a lot of experience.

34:14.224 --> 34:15.944
All right, well, come
aboard and we'll talk.

34:19.029 --> 34:21.315
- Shelly called.
- Oh.

34:21.315 --> 34:24.089
Thanks, Dad. For trying.

34:25.292 --> 34:27.755
She's not gonna budge,
so you're gonna have to.

34:28.630 --> 34:30.020
What?

34:31.568 --> 34:34.463
You know, Eric, when
I look back at my life,

34:34.694 --> 34:38.427
it feels like a series of bad choices

34:38.558 --> 34:40.980
linked together with regrets.

34:42.719 --> 34:43.985
There was a time

34:43.987 --> 34:46.721
when I put everything ahead of family.

34:47.724 --> 34:49.585
It's too late for me.

34:50.315 --> 34:52.148
It's not, for you.

34:52.795 --> 34:54.429
What are you talking about?

34:54.431 --> 34:55.929
Adele.

34:58.268 --> 35:00.168
You need to put her first.

35:00.170 --> 35:03.071
Even if that means giving
up on certain things.

35:03.073 --> 35:05.140
In the long run, it's worth it.

35:05.142 --> 35:06.741
You gotta trust me on this one.

35:08.111 --> 35:11.679
I love you, and I want you to be happy.

35:12.397 --> 35:13.729
And I want you to be

35:13.730 --> 35:15.917
the great father that I know you can be.

35:19.422 --> 35:21.523
- Grace!
- Hey, Norman.

35:21.991 --> 35:24.159
- What're you doing?
- Just a little nesting.

35:24.161 --> 35:25.986
In my office?

35:25.987 --> 35:29.807
Ahh! It's my office.
I'm the new Town Manager.

35:30.293 --> 35:31.566
Since when?

35:31.568 --> 35:33.223
Well, since you retired.

35:35.005 --> 35:36.971
Who told you I retired?

35:40.212 --> 35:41.985
Good morning, everyone.

35:43.283 --> 35:46.118
The first case on today's docket is...

35:48.285 --> 35:50.292
Saget versus Saget?

35:52.722 --> 35:54.322
Well...

35:54.723 --> 35:57.060
this day just got more interesting.

36:05.872 --> 36:07.505
That's gonna look good. Yeah.

36:07.506 --> 36:08.715
That's gonna be great.

36:08.715 --> 36:10.407
Hey! Surprise.

36:10.409 --> 36:12.177
What are you up to now?

36:12.177 --> 36:13.676
I'm auditioning these guys!

36:13.678 --> 36:16.346
I thought it'd be really great
if we had a band at our event.

36:16.348 --> 36:18.186
Peggy, I can't afford lobsters,

36:18.187 --> 36:19.988
and I can't afford a band.

36:19.988 --> 36:21.616
They said they'll do it for free!

36:21.949 --> 36:24.471
- That's 'cause they're terrible.
- How do you know?

36:24.473 --> 36:26.316
They played here about a year ago.

36:26.446 --> 36:28.369
That guy on guitar, he's tone-deaf,

36:28.369 --> 36:29.918
and the lead singer... hah!

36:29.918 --> 36:31.975
He literally drives
people away with his voice.

36:31.975 --> 36:33.851
Seriously, I've seen
it... right out the door.

36:33.851 --> 36:36.748
- Oh.
- You have got to settle down!

36:36.748 --> 36:38.201
And you have got to get excited!

36:38.203 --> 36:40.384
No! What I've got to do
is put the brakes on...

36:40.384 --> 36:42.558
on you and this whole event.

36:42.558 --> 36:44.174
Fine!

36:44.675 --> 36:47.626
I'm just gonna go do this on my own!

36:47.627 --> 36:49.946
Oh... Come on, Peggy!

36:50.268 --> 36:52.101
This isn't personal.

36:52.102 --> 36:54.801
- You're my father.
- Look, kid.

36:54.803 --> 36:57.170
Where I choose to play
golf, that's personal.

36:57.170 --> 36:58.586
This is just business.

36:58.985 --> 37:00.334
I've been too easy on you.

37:00.334 --> 37:02.297
Oh, yeah. I gotta tell you, Dad.

37:02.297 --> 37:05.057
- Being your son's been real easy.
- You are so entitled.

37:05.057 --> 37:07.197
- And who entitled me?
- That's your mother's fault.

37:07.199 --> 37:08.731
Which one?

37:08.733 --> 37:11.467
What, you think I should
give you special privileges

37:11.467 --> 37:14.128
- just because you're my son?
- Yes!

37:14.128 --> 37:15.713
That's not how business works.

37:15.713 --> 37:17.106
That's how family business works!

37:17.108 --> 37:19.676
- I'm trying to protect my investment.
- Of course you are!

37:19.678 --> 37:21.611
Come on, let's be honest with each other.

37:21.613 --> 37:23.544
I mean, I've gotten into trouble
in the past tons of times,

37:23.544 --> 37:24.776
and you never even picked up the phone.

37:24.776 --> 37:27.838
- This time is different.
- No. It's not different. You're a player.

37:27.838 --> 37:29.444
And a player needs a game,

37:29.444 --> 37:31.725
and unfortunately, golf
just doesn't cut it.

37:33.024 --> 37:35.485
And this whole semi-retirement
thing you got going on,

37:35.486 --> 37:37.119
it's... it's hard, I get it,

37:37.119 --> 37:38.728
you're having a hard time with it, fine.

37:38.728 --> 37:41.066
But do me a favor. Go
create a merger or something.

37:41.066 --> 37:44.028
Get involved. I got a better
idea. Why don't you pick up tennis?

37:44.286 --> 37:46.283
Do something else.

37:46.511 --> 37:48.890
Stay out of my business.

37:49.717 --> 37:51.189
And my life.

37:51.876 --> 37:53.125
You know what?

37:53.127 --> 37:55.027
- What?
- You're right.

37:55.029 --> 37:56.857
I'm glad you finally admitted

37:56.857 --> 37:58.194
that I was right about something.

37:58.194 --> 37:59.657
While I'm here,

37:59.657 --> 38:01.554
I am gonna take up tennis.

38:01.853 --> 38:05.490
My cardiologist says I have
the lungs of a 25-year-old.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.243
You wanna go a few rounds?

38:14.515 --> 38:16.282
Isn't that what we just did?

38:16.284 --> 38:17.516
No.

38:17.518 --> 38:19.119
When I really play you...

38:20.607 --> 38:23.289
you'll know it... son.

38:40.358 --> 38:42.341
There's nothing more to talk about.

38:42.343 --> 38:44.047
I'll sign the papers.

38:44.958 --> 38:46.479
But I'm coming with you.

38:48.049 --> 38:50.449
It's not for us, it's for Adele.

38:51.083 --> 38:52.768
I mean, look at me, Shelly.

38:53.062 --> 38:55.144
What have I got holding me here?

38:55.144 --> 38:58.899
I got no job, no you, and no Adele.

39:01.098 --> 39:02.630
What about your father?

39:02.632 --> 39:04.067
He wants me to go.

39:05.402 --> 39:06.801
I want to go.

39:08.142 --> 39:10.042
I want to be the father I never had.

39:11.673 --> 39:13.770
Will you work with me
once we both get settled?

39:16.279 --> 39:18.346
I want Adele to have her father.

39:18.348 --> 39:19.734
That's me.

39:30.710 --> 39:32.511
There ya are. Enjoy.

39:35.098 --> 39:36.364
Will Jeffers.

39:36.366 --> 39:38.032
Staying at my Mom's for the summer.

39:38.034 --> 39:39.767
Like the bad penny.

39:39.769 --> 39:41.319
What...

39:41.321 --> 39:43.705
Where does that saying come from?

39:43.707 --> 39:45.024
Well, a long time ago,

39:45.024 --> 39:46.764
when a penny was actually worth something,

39:46.764 --> 39:48.073
people would get a counterfeit

39:48.073 --> 39:51.414
and then immediately try to
palm it off on someone else, huh,

39:51.414 --> 39:55.528
but somehow, it always
seemed to boomerang back.

39:55.528 --> 39:56.985
Just like you.

39:57.354 --> 39:58.921
An unwanted item

39:58.921 --> 40:00.855
who keeps showing up again

40:00.857 --> 40:02.423
and again.

40:03.349 --> 40:04.782
Coffee?

40:04.878 --> 40:06.276
Yes, please.

40:11.764 --> 40:13.397
What are we doing here?

40:13.505 --> 40:15.165
I need to drop off some paperwork

40:15.166 --> 40:16.411
to my new boss.

40:16.952 --> 40:18.540
You're working here?

40:18.542 --> 40:20.537
Yeah, for a local fisherman.

40:23.046 --> 40:24.467
Which local fisherman?

40:26.583 --> 40:29.050
- Derek.
- Justine?

40:29.708 --> 40:31.441
Wait, this isn't...

40:31.481 --> 40:32.687
What's going on?

40:32.689 --> 40:34.131
No way. No, forget it, man!

40:34.132 --> 40:36.491
No job, no nothing. Get away from my boat.

40:36.493 --> 40:37.823
Both of you.

40:39.968 --> 40:42.635
Derek is Seth's best friend.

40:49.206 --> 40:50.905
Where's everybody else?

40:50.907 --> 40:52.340
Where's this new boss of mine?

40:52.342 --> 40:53.808
You're looking at him.

40:53.810 --> 40:55.143
Or her.

40:55.145 --> 40:57.612
- What?
- The outgoing editor promoted me.

40:57.614 --> 40:59.814
I am your new boss.

41:03.251 --> 41:04.452
Cheers.

41:19.256 --> 41:21.293
When I signed on as Town Manager,

41:21.294 --> 41:23.818
I assumed it was because we
did not have a Town Manager,

41:23.819 --> 41:25.631
and I assumed that because that's what you

41:25.632 --> 41:26.832
- told me.
- Hey.

41:26.833 --> 41:29.601
So, thank you so much for wasting my time,

41:29.601 --> 41:31.701
and you can tell Norman
he can keep my stapler.

41:31.702 --> 41:32.985
I left out a detail.

41:32.987 --> 41:34.720
You left out Norman!

41:34.722 --> 41:36.177
'Cause Norman won't go.

41:36.177 --> 41:37.589
So then just let him stay.

41:37.591 --> 41:38.791
He's a friend,

41:38.792 --> 41:40.108
a-and it pains me to say this,

41:40.110 --> 41:41.849
but he is a terrible Town Manager.

41:41.849 --> 41:43.882
So you want me to stage a coup

41:43.882 --> 41:46.072
for a job that I got talked into taking?

41:46.072 --> 41:49.324
Not a coup! But maybe you can
just get him to see that he's...

41:49.325 --> 41:53.141
Terrible? Bob, come on,
he can't be that bad.

41:53.440 --> 41:55.606
He ordered a dozen
reindeer and a Santa outfit

41:55.607 --> 41:57.086
for the Fourth of July Parade.

41:57.086 --> 41:59.211
That explains a lot about that parade.

41:59.211 --> 42:00.846
We'll, get him to leave,

42:00.848 --> 42:03.628
but... but make it seem
like it was his idea.

42:03.915 --> 42:05.421
Anything else?

42:05.628 --> 42:06.877
Well, don't tell him we talked,

42:06.878 --> 42:09.354
because he's a... he's a proud man...

42:09.356 --> 42:11.392
You were kidding about the
"anything else.," Right?

42:11.393 --> 42:14.259
I was. I did not sign up for this.

42:14.261 --> 42:15.830
Maybe you didn't sign up...

42:15.830 --> 42:17.498
but you did volunteer.

42:17.632 --> 42:19.826
Bob, I most certainly did not!

42:27.374 --> 42:30.455
Hey. That Saget father
and son are a trip, huh?

42:30.455 --> 42:33.178
Hate to spend Thanksgiving at their house.

42:33.180 --> 42:36.027
Before I call my bailiff and have
you escorted out, do you want to

42:36.028 --> 42:38.045
- tell me what you are doing here?
- Apologies.

42:38.045 --> 42:39.619
We haven't been properly introduced,

42:39.619 --> 42:41.475
and I have to say...

42:41.475 --> 42:43.712
your file picture doesn't do you justice.

42:44.269 --> 42:45.469
Ah, I'm Paul.

42:45.470 --> 42:47.470
Paul Watson. I'm Anthony's replacement.

42:48.690 --> 42:51.174
I'm the new D.A. and, yes,

42:51.176 --> 42:53.101
I should have told you
who I was at the seawall.

42:54.651 --> 42:56.883
Nice to formally meet you...

42:58.349 --> 42:59.549
Judge Lockhart.

43:02.220 --> 43:04.253
You're the new senior editor?

43:05.155 --> 43:06.955
How did that happen?

43:07.061 --> 43:08.452
I'm talented.

43:09.668 --> 43:11.948
The outgoing editor had it in his contract

43:11.948 --> 43:13.362
that he could name his successor,

43:13.362 --> 43:15.698
and, uh, he named me.

43:15.799 --> 43:17.112
You need a drink.

43:17.188 --> 43:19.288
Uh, we're good with these, thanks,

43:19.289 --> 43:20.926
and we'll have two vodkas, straight up.

43:21.156 --> 43:22.763
- Water.
- With a water back.

43:22.763 --> 43:23.979
Just water.

43:23.981 --> 43:25.581
You're not drinking?

43:25.583 --> 43:28.150
You're on the wagon? Again?

43:28.150 --> 43:29.685
Don't act so surprised.

43:29.687 --> 43:31.987
Something happen to cause
this sudden change of heart?

43:31.989 --> 43:34.056
Yeah, me wanting to be sober.

43:34.058 --> 43:35.448
Just because you have a few beers,

43:35.448 --> 43:37.793
or a drink here and there,
does not make you an alcoholic.

43:37.795 --> 43:39.595
It does if you're an alcoholic.

43:39.597 --> 43:41.897
- You're not.
- Next subject.

43:44.501 --> 43:45.884
Thanks.

43:46.152 --> 43:47.833
Look, uh...

43:48.372 --> 43:51.807
maybe you want to rethink
this job in Seattle.

43:53.110 --> 43:55.711
Why? Because I'm not drinking?

43:55.713 --> 43:58.335
I lost two reporters when
the senior editor left,

43:58.335 --> 44:00.349
which means I'm going to
need to lean on you more.

44:00.351 --> 44:03.284
- Lean away.
- You're a better writer when you drink.

44:03.284 --> 44:04.820
Whether I drink or I'm not drinking,

44:04.822 --> 44:06.440
that's not up for comment or discussion,

44:06.441 --> 44:07.670
do you understand?

44:09.944 --> 44:12.451
How's the medical
malpractice article coming?

44:13.194 --> 44:14.426
Almost done.

44:14.622 --> 44:17.437
Then you can take over Clive's
"Seattle Life" column this week?

44:17.950 --> 44:19.151
Absolutely.

44:19.153 --> 44:20.569
Deadline is Friday.

44:20.571 --> 44:22.113
You'll have it Thursday.

44:22.406 --> 44:24.106
I'm your boss now.

44:24.108 --> 44:26.975
You don't deliver, means I don't deliver.

44:26.977 --> 44:28.977
I always deliver.

44:31.382 --> 44:32.604
Okay.

44:33.784 --> 44:35.533
Just be careful.

44:36.701 --> 44:38.736
That stuff can kill ya.

44:46.263 --> 44:48.297
You should have told me
who you were the other day.

44:48.299 --> 44:49.931
Well, you didn't give me the chance.

44:49.933 --> 44:51.266
Something tells me

44:51.268 --> 44:53.135
that you like being the person in the room

44:53.137 --> 44:54.374
with the most information.

44:54.375 --> 44:55.939
Something tells me you don't like being

44:55.939 --> 44:58.084
the person in the room
without the most information.

44:58.843 --> 45:00.043
Look.

45:00.044 --> 45:01.310
We're gonna have to work together.

45:01.312 --> 45:03.745
- D.A. and Judge.
- Mm. Start over?

45:04.581 --> 45:06.348
Okay.

45:09.353 --> 45:11.186
Come in?

45:11.685 --> 45:13.913
Hi. Uh, Judge Lockhart?

45:13.914 --> 45:15.429
I'm Paul. Watson.

45:15.429 --> 45:17.565
Ah, I'm gonna be taking
over as D.A. in this county

45:17.565 --> 45:20.482
and I wanted to properly introduce myself.

45:21.389 --> 45:23.423
Nice to meet you, Mr. Watson.

45:23.424 --> 45:24.990
Oh. Paul.

45:24.991 --> 45:26.191
Olivia.

45:32.938 --> 45:34.876
By the way, I got rid of those socks.

45:34.877 --> 45:36.544
Thanks for the tip.

45:41.253 --> 45:42.653
Will?

45:43.182 --> 45:44.382
Hi, Sis.

45:51.873 --> 45:54.459
So, Mom just gave you
the keys to her house?

45:54.459 --> 45:56.595
Mm-hmm. She's in Cape Cod for the summer

45:56.596 --> 45:57.933
and she knew I needed a break.

45:57.945 --> 45:59.145
From?

45:59.398 --> 46:01.047
My divorce.

46:01.049 --> 46:02.348
What about work?

46:02.350 --> 46:03.695
Well, the divorce

46:03.695 --> 46:05.648
gave me quite a bit of
cash and stock, so I decided

46:05.648 --> 46:07.557
I'd take a leave from
the company this summer

46:07.558 --> 46:10.434
and figure out what my
next chapter should be.

46:10.593 --> 46:12.910
Shouldn't that chapter be in Georgia?

46:13.209 --> 46:15.044
Cedar Cove is my home.

46:15.046 --> 46:16.593
Not since high school.

46:17.196 --> 46:18.396
Look.

46:18.613 --> 46:20.150
I'm not going to cause any trouble.

46:20.635 --> 46:22.568
I haven't even told Grace that I'm back.

46:22.570 --> 46:24.304
She's with Cliff, I get that.

46:24.306 --> 46:26.246
You're not even gonna notice that I'm here.

46:36.284 --> 46:37.567
Oh!

46:37.569 --> 46:39.101
Sorry!

46:39.202 --> 46:40.869
I thought you already had a job

46:40.870 --> 46:44.006
- out at Cliff's ranch.
- Oh, not anymore. I quit.

46:44.312 --> 46:45.512
It was time.

46:45.768 --> 46:48.211
So, ah, what kind of work you looking for?

46:48.213 --> 46:49.679
No idea.

46:49.681 --> 46:52.481
- What did you do before Cliff's?
- Wall Street. I was a trader.

46:52.483 --> 46:54.075
How'd you end up here?

46:54.075 --> 46:55.318
If you don't mind my asking.

46:55.320 --> 46:57.336
Well... I grew up on a ranch,

46:57.338 --> 46:58.688
then I went to Columbia,

46:58.690 --> 47:00.843
Wharton, and then Wall Street,

47:00.843 --> 47:03.626
and then back to the ranch,
and eventually Cedar Cove,

47:03.628 --> 47:05.881
and now... unemployed.

47:05.881 --> 47:08.433
Quite the interesting career trajectory.

47:08.736 --> 47:10.215
It certainly is.

47:10.215 --> 47:12.660
Well... everybody has an interesting story,

47:12.660 --> 47:14.036
if you look hard enough.

47:14.038 --> 47:15.564
Actually, no, I usually find

47:15.565 --> 47:17.381
most other people's stories kind of boring.

47:17.381 --> 47:18.938
Yours, however...

47:20.111 --> 47:21.311
Buck Saget.

47:21.390 --> 47:22.595
"Buck"?

47:22.596 --> 47:24.747
Now you sound like a
ranch hand. Or a horse.

47:25.950 --> 47:27.217
I am neither.

47:27.550 --> 47:29.613
I currently run The Saget Company.

47:29.909 --> 47:31.187
By the way...

47:31.189 --> 47:33.723
you don't look for the job,
you make the job look for you.

47:33.725 --> 47:35.658
And how do you do that?

47:35.660 --> 47:36.993
It's all marketing.

47:36.995 --> 47:38.339
Selling yourself.

47:38.340 --> 47:41.631
You make yourself look so
good, they create a job for you.

47:41.632 --> 47:42.832
And how do I do that?

47:42.833 --> 47:45.199
Let me buy you another
coffee, and I'll explain.

47:45.200 --> 47:46.952
Shouldn't I be the one buying you a coffee?

47:46.953 --> 47:48.376
I like your style.

47:48.377 --> 47:50.659
- May I?
- Please.

47:57.041 --> 47:58.841
I don't need Moon.

47:58.842 --> 48:01.629
Or his lobster. Or his help!

48:01.630 --> 48:03.764
I should never have asked
him in the first place.

48:03.938 --> 48:05.971
Corrie's coming over later to help.

48:06.624 --> 48:09.065
You and Corrie can't cook all
of the food for the benefit.

48:09.066 --> 48:10.394
You're right.

48:12.590 --> 48:14.830
- Suit up!
- Me?

48:14.832 --> 48:16.266
Get shucking.

48:19.470 --> 48:21.170
I've read both your briefs

48:21.172 --> 48:24.012
and I've rendered a decision in this case.

48:24.012 --> 48:26.252
What's at stake with Saget versus Saget

48:26.252 --> 48:27.540
is control of the company.

48:27.540 --> 48:30.483
I've had time to study the
Articles of Incorporation,

48:30.483 --> 48:32.886
and according to those
articles, Mr. Saget Sr.

48:32.886 --> 48:35.117
holds controlling interest in the company,

48:35.119 --> 48:38.635
although Mr. Saget Jr. is president

48:38.635 --> 48:41.248
and in charge of the daily operations.

48:41.249 --> 48:43.230
Your honor, I must respectfully disagree.

48:43.231 --> 48:45.661
You must respectfully sit down

48:45.663 --> 48:47.012
and don't interrupt me

48:47.012 --> 48:48.698
or I'll have to hold you in contempt.

48:48.700 --> 48:50.233
Cost you a lot of money.

48:50.250 --> 48:52.631
The articles are not up for debate.

48:52.670 --> 48:55.088
They're signed and notarized.

48:55.769 --> 48:59.150
Mr. Saget... you seem
quite fidgety over there.

48:59.150 --> 49:00.600
Would you like to address the court?

49:00.601 --> 49:02.126
Yes, I do, Your Honor.

49:02.126 --> 49:04.743
My father is a passive
investor in this company.

49:04.744 --> 49:06.968
- My money's not so passive, though.
- Please.

49:06.968 --> 49:09.005
He has never been involved in this company,

49:09.006 --> 49:11.287
so I can't see how he can
effectively run this company.

49:11.289 --> 49:13.756
Papers or not. This is my company.

49:13.758 --> 49:15.229
You may sit.

49:16.694 --> 49:18.527
I'm afraid, in a court of law,

49:18.529 --> 49:20.790
the right papers make my job quite easy.

49:20.790 --> 49:23.191
Mr. Saget Sr., as majority stockholder,

49:23.192 --> 49:25.898
has every right to take
control of the company.

49:26.028 --> 49:28.304
Court finds in favor with the plaintiff...

49:28.306 --> 49:30.006
Warren Saget Sr.

49:30.006 --> 49:31.251
Court adjourned.

49:34.199 --> 49:35.924
- Hey.
- Hey.

49:38.179 --> 49:39.410
Need some help?

49:39.411 --> 49:41.087
I never turn down help.

49:41.112 --> 49:42.432
- Chop saw?
- Yeah.

49:42.433 --> 49:43.781
Don't tell Peggy I'm out here,

49:43.782 --> 49:45.348
she thinks I'm shucking clams.

49:48.820 --> 49:50.486
Not working today?

49:50.488 --> 49:52.794
Ah, I just got back from Seattle.

49:54.726 --> 49:56.626
Now, we can work this two ways...

49:57.434 --> 50:00.030
one, we can spend the
next hour dancing around

50:00.030 --> 50:02.163
whatever you came here to talk to me about,

50:02.843 --> 50:06.550
or... and I have to say
I'm a big fan of this one...

50:06.552 --> 50:08.118
just tell me what's going on.

50:08.120 --> 50:10.520
Jeri's my new boss at the Seattle paper.

50:10.732 --> 50:13.056
Well, that's not something I saw coming.

50:13.439 --> 50:15.292
Yeah. That makes two of us.

50:15.294 --> 50:17.027
What are you thinking?

50:17.029 --> 50:18.695
I like my job.

50:18.697 --> 50:19.963
No.

50:19.965 --> 50:21.492
No, I love the job.

50:22.468 --> 50:24.468
I want to stay, and I am going to stay.

50:26.004 --> 50:27.670
Look, this is my career,

50:28.507 --> 50:29.995
And I can't help that, at the moment,

50:29.996 --> 50:32.248
my career is linked to Jeri.

50:33.587 --> 50:36.856
Since you're here, I
imagine you want my opinion?

50:36.856 --> 50:38.167
Yes.

50:38.167 --> 50:39.816
Doesn't matter how I feel.

50:39.818 --> 50:41.785
Matters how Olivia feels.

50:43.055 --> 50:44.921
Talk to Olivia.

50:44.923 --> 50:46.923
Well, that's easier said than done.

50:46.925 --> 50:48.831
I don't know what's
going on between you two,

50:48.831 --> 50:51.453
but I speak from experience
when I tell you...

50:51.453 --> 50:53.113
don't give her too much time

50:53.113 --> 50:55.131
to think about whatever
you are fighting about.

50:55.133 --> 50:56.766
Talk to her.

51:03.610 --> 51:06.096
Uh-uh-uh! I only
want half of that.

51:06.837 --> 51:10.241
Your willpower really annoys me sometimes.

51:10.241 --> 51:12.215
- Sorry.
- No, you are not.

51:12.217 --> 51:14.150
No. I'm not.

51:15.522 --> 51:17.787
So, you said the pie was a bribe.

51:17.789 --> 51:19.574
Mm-hmm. For advice.

51:20.007 --> 51:22.170
Go on.

51:22.170 --> 51:24.070
Norman. Our ex-Town Manager.

51:24.070 --> 51:25.929
He doesn't realize the "ex" part,

51:25.931 --> 51:27.259
and he won't leave his office.

51:27.259 --> 51:29.235
- Literally.
- Oh.

51:29.235 --> 51:31.165
I don't want to be rude to
him, but in order for me to

51:31.166 --> 51:32.649
do the job that I did not want to do,

51:32.649 --> 51:34.236
but I got talked into doing,

51:34.236 --> 51:36.276
I need him to vacate the office!

51:36.276 --> 51:38.213
Maybe you could find
something else for him to do.

51:38.213 --> 51:39.542
Like spelunking?

51:39.542 --> 51:42.507
Yes! Grace! Spelunking.

51:42.508 --> 51:45.006
How am I supposed to find
this man something else to do?

51:45.006 --> 51:47.606
Now, I know it's a novel idea,
but you could talk to him.

51:47.838 --> 51:50.307
You know, this pie is so good,
I think I'll have the other half.

51:50.308 --> 51:52.943
Ooh! I am so happy to give
you the extra calories.

51:54.920 --> 51:56.453
Paul Watson.

51:56.454 --> 51:58.604
I would love for you to meet Grace Sherman.

51:59.064 --> 52:00.701
- Hi.
- Hi!

52:00.702 --> 52:02.133
Paul is our new D.A.

52:02.134 --> 52:03.334
Ahh!

52:03.497 --> 52:04.863
Makes me want to break the law.

52:04.864 --> 52:06.967
Oh, please, don't.

52:06.968 --> 52:08.949
Grace is our new Town Manager.

52:08.950 --> 52:10.552
- Oh!
- Mm.

52:11.257 --> 52:13.176
Okay. I'm just gonna go,

52:13.178 --> 52:16.346
you know, let you two do that
little lawyer thing that you do.

52:16.348 --> 52:17.564
Oh, I was just leaving.

52:17.566 --> 52:18.766
I'll walk you out.

52:28.060 --> 52:29.893
Came to check up on you.

52:31.283 --> 52:32.483
I'm okay.

52:32.484 --> 52:34.489
I know you really wanted
that job with Derek.

52:34.490 --> 52:35.775
Ah, it was perfect.

52:35.775 --> 52:36.975
Out on the water.

52:36.976 --> 52:39.397
I love the water. I miss it.

52:39.397 --> 52:40.846
You're starting to sound like Seth.

52:40.847 --> 52:42.547
Hey, I'm not Seth, okay?

52:44.142 --> 52:46.476
Sorry. Can we drop it?

52:46.478 --> 52:48.345
- But I...
- Just drop it.

52:48.347 --> 52:49.788
Please?

52:54.886 --> 52:57.586
I was wondering if I could buy you lunch.

52:57.781 --> 52:59.398
A working lunch.

52:59.398 --> 53:02.208
I want to pick your
brain on staff, and, uh...

53:02.208 --> 53:03.460
Jack.

53:03.462 --> 53:04.686
- Hey.
- Um...

53:04.693 --> 53:05.944
This is Paul Watson,

53:05.945 --> 53:07.352
- he's the new D.A.
- Hi.

53:07.352 --> 53:09.032
- Hey.
- Paul, This is Jack Griffith.

53:09.034 --> 53:11.443
He runs our local paper.

53:11.443 --> 53:13.271
Listen. I was hoping that we could talk.

53:13.271 --> 53:14.904
Ah, I know that you're on break.

53:14.906 --> 53:16.680
We were just about to have lunch.

53:16.681 --> 53:18.957
My fault. We have administrative things

53:18.957 --> 53:21.014
we need to talk over. We should go.

53:21.014 --> 53:23.193
Okay, ah, well, listen,
I'll... I'll catch you later,

53:23.193 --> 53:25.982
but, um, I really would
like to talk to you.

53:26.036 --> 53:27.236
Yeah.

53:35.681 --> 53:37.797
- Jack's a nice guy.
- He is.

53:38.628 --> 53:40.253
He's more than a reporter, though.

53:40.254 --> 53:43.071
So... boyfriend?

53:45.805 --> 53:47.886
See, you took a beat
to answer that question,

53:47.886 --> 53:49.189
which means one of two things...

53:49.189 --> 53:51.056
either it's a new relationship,

53:51.056 --> 53:52.275
and you haven't gotten to the
place where you're comfortable

53:52.276 --> 53:53.515
with the monikers,

53:53.720 --> 53:56.119
or you're in a relationship,

53:56.119 --> 53:58.680
and something has given you pause...

53:59.053 --> 54:01.354
like the pause you took
to answer that question.

54:01.678 --> 54:04.604
Moon makes a mean latte.

54:05.656 --> 54:07.968
Got it. You don't want to talk about it.

54:08.199 --> 54:10.541
Not unless you want to
talk about your divorce.

54:11.048 --> 54:12.248
How'd you know?

54:12.249 --> 54:14.169
A hunch. The look on your face tells me

54:14.170 --> 54:15.467
the hunch is correct.

54:15.586 --> 54:18.624
Wow. You gotta remind me to
never play poker with you.

54:18.624 --> 54:19.971
Done.

54:20.141 --> 54:22.877
So... latte, huh?

54:22.877 --> 54:24.276
Best in the state.

54:24.278 --> 54:26.178
Actually, I do have some business

54:26.180 --> 54:27.767
I'd like to discuss with you.

54:27.982 --> 54:30.425
- Rebecca Jennings.
- Your A.D.A.

54:30.425 --> 54:32.719
Well, you know her better
than I do. What's your opinion?

54:32.719 --> 54:34.527
I had my issues with her in the beginning,

54:34.527 --> 54:36.355
but she's gotten better.

54:36.777 --> 54:38.063
So she is strong-willed.

54:38.064 --> 54:40.252
Oh, that's a nice way of puttin' it.

54:40.252 --> 54:42.932
She and I had a 10-minute argument

54:42.932 --> 54:45.125
over how to use the coffee
machine. I mean, you take a pod,

54:45.126 --> 54:46.440
you put it in, you press
a button... thank you...

54:46.440 --> 54:47.840
and she still found it
necessary to school me

54:47.840 --> 54:49.530
on the proper procedure.

54:50.364 --> 54:52.339
Rebecca's smart,

54:52.347 --> 54:56.334
- but she often leads with her attitude.
- How'd Anthony deal with her?

54:56.334 --> 54:59.343
For a D.A., Anthony was very laid back.

54:59.343 --> 55:01.629
That's not really my way.

55:01.629 --> 55:03.317
You like a little more control?

55:03.317 --> 55:06.462
Yeah, and I think I'm not the
only person at this table who does.

55:06.493 --> 55:07.695
So, any helpful hints

55:07.695 --> 55:10.033
on how to deal with the
intense Miss Jennings?

55:10.033 --> 55:12.320
- You want my help.
- I want a new A.D.A.

55:12.320 --> 55:14.624
I didn't think you'd be
one to run from a challenge.

55:14.624 --> 55:17.779
Nice! Reverse psychology.

55:17.779 --> 55:20.030
My minor. Yale.

55:20.592 --> 55:22.951
Actually, I am concerned

55:22.952 --> 55:25.031
that Rebecca's not gonna
be able to fall in line.

55:25.032 --> 55:26.795
But you don't know that for sure.

55:26.796 --> 55:28.838
- Meaning?
- Well, everybody deserves

55:28.839 --> 55:31.166
an opportunity to prove themselves.

55:31.212 --> 55:34.782
Are we talking about Rebecca,
or are we talking about Jack?

55:34.782 --> 55:36.287
Rebecca.

55:37.285 --> 55:39.068
How about that latte?

55:39.068 --> 55:41.220
Yes. I think.

55:43.042 --> 55:44.256
Sure, Luke's qualified.

55:44.258 --> 55:45.878
So hire him. You were going to.

55:45.878 --> 55:48.593
Seth's my friend. I don't feel like
hiring the guy who stole his girlfriend.

55:48.594 --> 55:51.331
No one "stole" me. I'm a person,
Derek, not an unlocked car.

55:51.331 --> 55:53.566
Oh, yeah? Well, you don't know
how broken up he was about it.

55:53.568 --> 55:54.535
I mean, you really hurt him.

55:54.536 --> 55:56.283
Have... have you talked to
him? Have you called him?

55:56.636 --> 55:58.437
I didn't think that he'd
want to talk from me.

55:58.439 --> 55:59.761
No, you didn't want to talk to him,

55:59.761 --> 56:01.707
because it's uncomfortable for you.

56:01.709 --> 56:04.443
So, are you upset with me or with Luke?

56:05.974 --> 56:08.647
It's funny. I always thought
you were a pretty fair guy.

56:08.649 --> 56:10.916
But what you're doing to Luke isn't fair

56:10.918 --> 56:12.651
and it isn't right.

56:12.653 --> 56:14.614
Kind of like what you did to Seth.

56:21.193 --> 56:23.289
You've got a lot of stuff.

56:23.448 --> 56:25.030
Hate to throw anything out.

56:25.032 --> 56:26.795
- You a hoarder?
- Collector.

56:26.796 --> 56:29.019
Can you sell any of this at an auction?

56:29.103 --> 56:30.436
Probably not.

56:30.701 --> 56:32.359
You're a hoarder.

56:33.206 --> 56:35.119
Oh, I met this woman yesterday

56:35.120 --> 56:36.842
who might be interested in
renting the third bedroom.

56:36.844 --> 56:39.161
Anything that lowers my rent interests me.

56:39.427 --> 56:41.604
So, uh, when do you start your new job?

56:41.849 --> 56:43.315
Tomorrow.

56:43.317 --> 56:45.439
- Don't be nervous.
- Is it that obvious?

56:45.440 --> 56:49.148
I read people for a living,
but, yeah, it's pretty obvious.

56:49.148 --> 56:51.710
I know some of the doctors
there. They're really nice.

56:51.711 --> 56:53.791
And I'm the one who should be nervous.

56:53.792 --> 56:55.992
- Why you?
- I have a meeting with my new boss

56:55.993 --> 56:57.746
and I just got my old boss to like me

56:57.747 --> 56:59.733
and now I got to start all
over again with someone new.

56:59.734 --> 57:00.965
And if he doesn't like me,

57:00.965 --> 57:03.969
we're going to need a fourth
roommate to cover my rent.

57:03.971 --> 57:06.611
So here's hoping I don't lose my job.

57:06.741 --> 57:08.641
You've got to be more positive.

57:08.643 --> 57:12.311
If we're gonna make this
work, you got to be less perky.

57:12.594 --> 57:14.079
I'll see what I can do.

57:14.081 --> 57:15.786
Bring down the perky.

57:22.834 --> 57:24.169
Bob! Oven!

57:24.170 --> 57:25.898
- Peggy.
- What?

57:25.899 --> 57:28.453
This kitchen is not
equipped to cook enough food

57:28.453 --> 57:29.837
for all the people at the benefit,

57:29.837 --> 57:32.592
and I am not equipped to
be your short-order cook.

57:32.593 --> 57:34.779
- You're my sous chef!
- I'm your husband!

57:34.779 --> 57:36.241
Well, then start acting like it,

57:36.241 --> 57:37.694
and get busy with those lobsters!

57:37.694 --> 57:39.868
They're not gonna butterfly themselves.

57:46.044 --> 57:47.646
I'm on strike.

57:47.690 --> 57:49.256
You don't belong to a union.

57:49.257 --> 57:50.853
- I'll join.
- Bob...

57:50.853 --> 57:53.219
if this event doesn't
happen, I'll be humiliated,

57:53.709 --> 57:55.654
and I can't let all those fishermen down.

57:56.009 --> 57:58.744
And I can't let Moon see
I can't do it without him.

57:58.901 --> 58:00.967
Just talk to Moon.

58:01.145 --> 58:02.377
Who?

58:04.799 --> 58:06.165
I feel bad.

58:06.167 --> 58:08.567
Don't. It's okay.

58:08.569 --> 58:11.408
No, it's not. I'm the reason
that Derek won't hire you.

58:12.120 --> 58:14.944
Hey, if I had to choose
between you and the job,

58:14.945 --> 58:16.575
it's a no-brainer.

58:18.596 --> 58:21.224
But I don't think Derek's the
only reason that you're upset.

58:23.084 --> 58:24.583
You should call him.

58:25.027 --> 58:26.830
- Seth?
- Mm.

58:28.643 --> 58:30.309
What would I say?

58:34.595 --> 58:35.995
In group, we do a lot of work

58:35.997 --> 58:37.496
on how you can't avoid the pain

58:37.498 --> 58:39.175
or the discomfort of things.

58:39.867 --> 58:41.634
By you not talking to Seth,

58:41.636 --> 58:43.280
it's not making you feel better,

58:43.280 --> 58:44.878
it's making you feel worse.

58:46.440 --> 58:48.158
He deserves closure.

58:50.751 --> 58:52.206
So do you.

59:01.361 --> 59:02.675
Rebecca.

59:02.840 --> 59:04.573
Can we talk later? I'm running late.

59:04.575 --> 59:06.342
Rebecca.

59:07.428 --> 59:09.161
Is there something wrong?

59:09.163 --> 59:10.696
The Simmons motion.

59:10.698 --> 59:13.765
- I filed it.
- Yeah, that's the problem.

59:13.766 --> 59:15.248
I don't understand.

59:15.249 --> 59:17.331
I sign off on everything
that goes through my office,

59:17.331 --> 59:20.940
because I am responsible for
everything that comes out of my office.

59:20.942 --> 59:22.143
Sorry.

59:22.209 --> 59:24.328
I don't think that you are.

59:24.329 --> 59:26.145
No. I'm not.

59:26.353 --> 59:27.613
And I shouldn't have to be.

59:27.615 --> 59:31.116
- I was doing my job.
- Wow! Well, you're honest.

59:31.118 --> 59:32.433
And I'm competent.

59:32.433 --> 59:34.710
- Look, I've been filing motions since I...
- It doesn't matter

59:34.710 --> 59:36.255
what you used to do.

59:36.257 --> 59:38.743
What matters is what you will do,

59:38.743 --> 59:40.492
going forward.

59:40.493 --> 59:42.649
Your way is going to cost time.

59:42.649 --> 59:44.166
My way

59:44.166 --> 59:45.862
is the way that we're gonna do things.

59:45.862 --> 59:47.466
You know why?

59:47.468 --> 59:49.426
Because I'm in charge.

59:49.785 --> 59:51.537
Not you.

01:00:03.384 --> 01:00:04.650
Hey!

01:00:04.652 --> 01:00:06.933
You look like you're
having a tough morning.

01:00:07.621 --> 01:00:09.638
Well, if I'm completely honest,

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:13.659
which I am trying to do
more of these days, uh...

01:00:14.466 --> 01:00:15.962
Yeah, I'm a little upset.

01:00:16.104 --> 01:00:17.304
What?

01:00:18.114 --> 01:00:20.169
Okay, who?

01:00:22.108 --> 01:00:23.308
Olivia.

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:24.839
You're angry at Olivia?

01:00:25.873 --> 01:00:29.174
Just feels like she's
never gonna forgive me.

01:00:30.011 --> 01:00:32.261
And if she doesn't, then...

01:00:32.263 --> 01:00:34.279
you know, what am I doing?

01:00:34.281 --> 01:00:35.647
Do you remember what it was like

01:00:35.649 --> 01:00:37.216
when you were a kid on Christmas Eve?

01:00:37.218 --> 01:00:39.317
- Yeah.
- Made you crazy to wait

01:00:39.318 --> 01:00:40.708
for Christmas morning,

01:00:40.708 --> 01:00:43.288
and the more you thought
about it, the longer it seemed?

01:00:44.191 --> 01:00:46.225
Okay.

01:00:46.227 --> 01:00:49.481
People we end up hurting have
their own time table for healing.

01:00:49.664 --> 01:00:50.864
You can't get to where you want to get

01:00:50.865 --> 01:00:52.321
any faster than others allow,

01:00:52.321 --> 01:00:54.536
just because it's uncomfortable for you.

01:00:56.137 --> 01:00:57.736
And you're not angry at her,

01:00:57.738 --> 01:00:59.471
as much as you're mad at yourself.

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:06.557
How did you get to be so wise?

01:01:07.314 --> 01:01:08.781
I took classes.

01:01:09.917 --> 01:01:11.516
Well, they're paying off, by the way.

01:01:13.521 --> 01:01:15.354
- Nicely done.
- Thanks.

01:01:16.891 --> 01:01:18.357
Hi.

01:01:18.359 --> 01:01:19.879
How can I help you?

01:01:19.879 --> 01:01:21.496
Think I crossed the line.

01:01:22.368 --> 01:01:26.124
With the "second chances" and Jack.

01:01:28.102 --> 01:01:29.787
The ring just came off...

01:01:30.137 --> 01:01:31.702
by the way.

01:01:33.174 --> 01:01:35.115
That's the reason I took this job.

01:01:36.518 --> 01:01:38.084
How long were you married?

01:01:38.085 --> 01:01:39.373
12 years.

01:01:40.314 --> 01:01:41.990
First two were good.

01:01:43.084 --> 01:01:44.583
The next eight were...

01:01:44.585 --> 01:01:46.085
livable.

01:01:46.087 --> 01:01:48.247
Last two were unbearably horrible.

01:01:48.525 --> 01:01:49.791
Thank you.

01:01:49.792 --> 01:01:51.038
For?

01:01:51.038 --> 01:01:53.358
Not asking about Jack.

01:01:53.938 --> 01:01:55.138
Sure.

01:01:55.446 --> 01:01:57.830
So, um, did you

01:01:57.832 --> 01:01:59.598
call a truce with Rebecca?

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:00.800
No.

01:02:01.068 --> 01:02:02.615
She won't budge.

01:02:04.422 --> 01:02:06.708
Thinking I'm gonna have to let her go.

01:02:20.824 --> 01:02:22.424
Hey.

01:02:22.426 --> 01:02:23.858
You're gonna fire her?

01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:25.604
Would you want to work with her?

01:02:25.604 --> 01:02:28.101
- I'm a judge.
- You didn't answer the question.

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:29.381
- She's...
- Gone.

01:02:29.383 --> 01:02:31.634
End of story. Moving on.

01:02:44.218 --> 01:02:45.764
Hi, Bob.

01:02:45.766 --> 01:02:47.716
I've got two good people in my life.

01:02:47.718 --> 01:02:50.913
Two really good people who
are trying to do a good thing

01:02:50.914 --> 01:02:54.055
and they only want the best for
Cedar Cove and the community.

01:02:55.592 --> 01:02:57.028
"But..."?

01:02:57.028 --> 01:02:58.993
But they're both stubborn as mules,

01:02:58.995 --> 01:03:01.129
and because they refuse to work together,

01:03:01.131 --> 01:03:03.231
I've got dishpan hands!

01:03:03.233 --> 01:03:04.933
I don't want dishpan hands.

01:03:04.935 --> 01:03:07.836
I want you. I need you.

01:03:07.838 --> 01:03:09.883
Cedar Cove needs you.

01:03:10.642 --> 01:03:12.141
Peggy needs you.

01:03:13.577 --> 01:03:15.276
Ah, for the love of all things holy,

01:03:15.278 --> 01:03:16.918
come on back to the benefit

01:03:17.175 --> 01:03:19.642
and get me the heck out of the kitchen.

01:03:20.371 --> 01:03:21.575
Huh?

01:03:21.685 --> 01:03:24.786
- I love being Town Manager.
- Liar!

01:03:24.788 --> 01:03:26.042
I need this job.

01:03:26.042 --> 01:03:28.080
Okay, that's closer to the truth,

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:29.324
but it's not the whole truth.

01:03:31.094 --> 01:03:34.012
This job is saving my marriage.

01:03:34.427 --> 01:03:36.564
Look, when I took early retirement,

01:03:36.564 --> 01:03:38.891
I had lots of time, lots of money,

01:03:38.891 --> 01:03:42.069
but my wife isn't used to
having me around all day.

01:03:43.278 --> 01:03:46.130
I don't have any hobbies. Work is my hobby.

01:03:46.131 --> 01:03:47.331
I...

01:03:47.571 --> 01:03:49.217
I'd love to give up this job,

01:03:49.217 --> 01:03:50.712
but I can't.

01:03:59.439 --> 01:04:02.056
Got your text. What's up?

01:04:02.057 --> 01:04:03.950
Whatever you did, I forgive you.

01:04:03.951 --> 01:04:05.451
What did I do?

01:04:05.452 --> 01:04:07.727
I don't know. But I do
know that Derek called me

01:04:07.728 --> 01:04:09.765
and he hired me on a probationary basis.

01:04:09.766 --> 01:04:12.266
- I got the job.
- That's great!

01:04:12.267 --> 01:04:14.549
- Thank you for not listening to me.
- Anytime.

01:04:17.309 --> 01:04:19.442
Oh! The reporter.

01:04:19.465 --> 01:04:21.476
Jack. The lawyer...

01:04:21.476 --> 01:04:23.184
D.A., ah Paul.

01:04:23.184 --> 01:04:24.813
Oh, I remember the name.

01:04:24.815 --> 01:04:26.652
So you're here to see Judge Lockhart?

01:04:26.652 --> 01:04:30.050
No, actually, I'm getting
background on Saget versus Saget.

01:04:30.050 --> 01:04:31.764
Ahh! That should be an interesting story.

01:04:31.765 --> 01:04:33.052
Yeah. That's the plan.

01:04:33.052 --> 01:04:34.899
If you'd like, I'm
available for an interview.

01:04:34.899 --> 01:04:36.891
But you had nothing to do with it.

01:04:36.893 --> 01:04:38.226
I am the new D.A.

01:04:38.228 --> 01:04:41.896
Yeah, but no offense,
that's not really news.

01:04:41.898 --> 01:04:43.898
Seems like, ah, around here,

01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:45.882
a new D.A. might be.

01:04:46.507 --> 01:04:49.935
Small-town paper, but
ah, never small stories.

01:04:49.936 --> 01:04:51.403
Small. Huh.

01:04:51.575 --> 01:04:53.204
Afraid so.

01:04:53.331 --> 01:04:56.110
By the way, sorry for interrupting
you and Olivia the other day.

01:04:56.350 --> 01:04:58.379
She's a fascinating woman.

01:04:58.381 --> 01:04:59.938
You're a lucky man.

01:05:04.237 --> 01:05:05.437
Yeah.

01:05:10.444 --> 01:05:12.486
You still mad at me?

01:05:12.819 --> 01:05:14.318
Alex!

01:05:14.564 --> 01:05:16.337
I didn't even recognize you.

01:05:16.337 --> 01:05:17.932
You scared me for a second.

01:05:17.934 --> 01:05:19.527
Thought you weren't talking to me.

01:05:19.769 --> 01:05:21.358
No.

01:05:21.498 --> 01:05:23.631
Good, because...

01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:27.242
Well, I just wanted to tell
you again how sorry I am.

01:05:27.244 --> 01:05:29.705
- I never meant to...
- I know, and it's okay.

01:05:29.705 --> 01:05:31.737
You might've done me a
favor in the long run.

01:05:31.737 --> 01:05:32.990
I landed a new job.

01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:34.670
Back in the business world.

01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:36.681
I'm working at The Saget Company.

01:05:36.809 --> 01:05:39.716
Oh! Well, that's, you know, great.

01:05:40.116 --> 01:05:41.343
Good to see you.

01:05:41.344 --> 01:05:42.544
Yeah.

01:05:46.463 --> 01:05:47.798
Guess who?

01:05:48.038 --> 01:05:49.697
Will.

01:05:51.568 --> 01:05:53.101
I'm back.

01:05:53.103 --> 01:05:54.493
Mm.

01:06:00.911 --> 01:06:02.410
Hello!

01:06:02.412 --> 01:06:04.232
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:06:04.232 --> 01:06:06.581
I'm sorry. Who are you,
and what are you doing here?

01:06:06.583 --> 01:06:07.815
Buck hired me.

01:06:07.817 --> 01:06:09.535
Oh, good. Obviously, his first decision

01:06:09.536 --> 01:06:11.770
was a smart one. Ah, actually, truth is,

01:06:11.770 --> 01:06:14.939
I've been looking for an assistant for a
while now, so this should work out nicely.

01:06:14.941 --> 01:06:18.209
Uh, coffee order... caffe mocha,
no whipped cream, no sugar,

01:06:18.210 --> 01:06:20.170
extra-dry, half-skim, half... full milk.

01:06:20.170 --> 01:06:21.617
You're kidding right?

01:06:22.065 --> 01:06:23.962
Ah, no. Chop-chop.

01:06:23.962 --> 01:06:25.577
I'm not your new assistant.

01:06:25.578 --> 01:06:28.041
I'm your new Chief Financial Officer.

01:06:29.856 --> 01:06:33.497
And by the way, that coffee order
of yours is completely ridiculous.

01:06:36.054 --> 01:06:37.287
You can go.

01:06:44.688 --> 01:06:46.020
Why?

01:06:46.022 --> 01:06:47.789
Peggy and Moon aren't speaking.

01:06:47.791 --> 01:06:50.291
All I can tell you is I am all shucked out.

01:06:50.293 --> 01:06:52.904
I will never look at
clams the same way again.

01:06:52.904 --> 01:06:54.155
Benefit cookout?

01:06:54.156 --> 01:06:56.097
Peggy thinks she can do it without Moon.

01:06:56.099 --> 01:06:57.911
I wish she would do it without me.

01:06:58.335 --> 01:06:59.867
I'm no cook.

01:06:59.869 --> 01:07:01.803
I can't get her to budge.

01:07:01.805 --> 01:07:03.946
Well, then, I suggest you tackle this

01:07:03.946 --> 01:07:05.375
from the other end.

01:07:05.699 --> 01:07:09.266
Now, I'm actually here on
official Town Manager business.

01:07:09.412 --> 01:07:11.249
- Oh?
- Norman.

01:07:11.305 --> 01:07:13.181
- Ahh.
- You got me into this.

01:07:13.183 --> 01:07:14.415
Well, that I did.

01:07:14.417 --> 01:07:16.231
Now you're gonna get me out of it.

01:07:17.438 --> 01:07:18.642
What do you think?

01:07:18.643 --> 01:07:19.909
I love it.

01:07:20.056 --> 01:07:22.657
And the rent seems pretty reasonable.

01:07:22.659 --> 01:07:24.583
Can I get back to you on the deposit?

01:07:24.583 --> 01:07:26.388
- Yeah. Sure.
- Hi.

01:07:26.389 --> 01:07:27.832
I was just showing the room.

01:07:27.833 --> 01:07:29.099
Justine.

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:31.591
- Rebecca.
- You guys know each other?

01:07:31.592 --> 01:07:34.352
Rebecca tried to put a sick
friend of mine in prison.

01:07:34.938 --> 01:07:36.170
Oh.

01:07:36.172 --> 01:07:37.415
He didn't go.

01:07:37.416 --> 01:07:38.890
Not because you didn't want him to.

01:07:39.009 --> 01:07:41.203
True. But he's doing well, I hear.

01:07:41.204 --> 01:07:42.394
No thanks to you.

01:07:42.395 --> 01:07:44.883
- Look, this is a bit...
- Don't worry, I'm out of here.

01:07:45.786 --> 01:07:47.219
Wait! I...

01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:48.420
Great.

01:07:48.421 --> 01:07:51.088
You just lost us the most normal
person who answered our ad.

01:07:54.138 --> 01:07:55.707
I hired Alex because she's bright.

01:07:55.708 --> 01:07:57.488
- Oh! Right!
- Attractive and bright.

01:07:57.489 --> 01:07:58.900
Her job is to straighten out this mess

01:07:58.901 --> 01:08:00.238
that you got the company into.

01:08:00.239 --> 01:08:01.381
- I can handle it.
- Nah, I've been

01:08:01.382 --> 01:08:03.076
cleaning up after you your whole life.

01:08:03.076 --> 01:08:04.652
You know, what would be a
lot simpler for both of us

01:08:04.652 --> 01:08:05.955
is if you just went back to New York.

01:08:05.955 --> 01:08:07.697
- I like it here.
- Really? I don't think you do.

01:08:07.698 --> 01:08:08.898
I do.

01:08:08.899 --> 01:08:11.273
It's great being the only
shark walking down the street.

01:08:13.124 --> 01:08:14.617
You do me a favor and you make sure

01:08:14.618 --> 01:08:16.578
you tell her that she stays out of my way.

01:08:16.578 --> 01:08:18.720
No. You stay out of her way.

01:08:18.782 --> 01:08:21.682
This company has my name and,
more importantly, my money.

01:08:21.684 --> 01:08:24.633
Now, you don't like it and I don't
like it, but you are stuck with me

01:08:24.633 --> 01:08:27.564
until I think I can trust you
with the reins again. Okay?

01:08:36.666 --> 01:08:38.499
I didn't hear you come in.

01:08:38.501 --> 01:08:39.705
How was your day?

01:08:40.104 --> 01:08:41.408
Not great.

01:08:43.305 --> 01:08:44.826
Rebecca Jennings.

01:08:44.826 --> 01:08:46.090
- Rebecca?
- Thought I found the

01:08:46.090 --> 01:08:48.541
perfect place to move
into, just one problem...

01:08:48.541 --> 01:08:49.645
Rebecca.

01:08:49.645 --> 01:08:53.046
Linnette McAfee is the other
roommate, and she's great, but...

01:08:53.049 --> 01:08:56.317
You know, that stuff with Luke was
a long time ago, and people change.

01:08:56.319 --> 01:08:57.734
Not her.

01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:03.424
Are you gonna tell me
what's going on with Jack?

01:09:03.426 --> 01:09:05.493
I'm not blind, you know.

01:09:05.495 --> 01:09:06.959
We're working through something.

01:09:06.959 --> 01:09:09.696
That's what you said before
you and Dad got divorced.

01:09:10.466 --> 01:09:12.700
Different people, different situation.

01:09:12.702 --> 01:09:14.452
He loves you, you know.

01:09:14.453 --> 01:09:15.765
I know.

01:09:16.291 --> 01:09:17.720
But how do you know?

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:19.953
Mom, it's written all over his face.

01:09:21.207 --> 01:09:23.609
He's been nuts for you since day one.

01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:28.381
Well, maybe it's good that
I don't have an apartment,

01:09:28.381 --> 01:09:30.050
since I don't even have a job.

01:09:30.086 --> 01:09:31.499
You want to move out.

01:09:31.499 --> 01:09:32.908
- Yes.
- And you want to get...

01:09:32.908 --> 01:09:34.689
...a job so you can move out.

01:09:34.691 --> 01:09:35.890
Yes.

01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:38.082
Anything worth having

01:09:38.084 --> 01:09:39.716
is worth fighting for.

01:09:39.964 --> 01:09:42.352
You know, I could say
the same thing to you.

01:10:01.514 --> 01:10:03.080
You're working kinda late.

01:10:03.082 --> 01:10:04.999
You too, by the looks of it.

01:10:05.001 --> 01:10:07.485
Peggy sent me out for butter two hours ago.

01:10:08.174 --> 01:10:10.188
Truth is I'm hiding.

01:10:10.190 --> 01:10:11.556
Can't stand the heat, huh?

01:10:11.556 --> 01:10:13.033
So I got out of the kitchen.

01:10:13.033 --> 01:10:15.579
I just finished my Seattle story for Jeri.

01:10:15.579 --> 01:10:17.638
Thought I'd, uh, go take a little break

01:10:17.638 --> 01:10:19.477
before getting into the second one.

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:22.466
Look, Bob.

01:10:22.769 --> 01:10:24.602
I owe you an apology.

01:10:26.637 --> 01:10:30.234
I fell off the wagon a couple of weeks ago.

01:10:31.010 --> 01:10:32.510
And I should have said something,

01:10:32.512 --> 01:10:34.145
but I was just too embarrassed.

01:10:35.515 --> 01:10:36.814
You knew, didn't you?

01:10:37.009 --> 01:10:40.147
Relapse is part of the recovery, Jack.

01:10:40.415 --> 01:10:42.017
You know, it's not the mistakes we make,

01:10:42.018 --> 01:10:45.723
it's... it's how we react and
correct those mistakes that counts.

01:10:45.928 --> 01:10:48.626
Well, I started covering up and, um...

01:10:48.859 --> 01:10:50.860
lying to people. You know.

01:10:51.564 --> 01:10:53.297
Lying to Olivia.

01:10:55.233 --> 01:10:56.434
Sober now.

01:10:56.436 --> 01:10:58.676
I just finished a great article

01:10:59.101 --> 01:11:00.566
on the Sagets' internal fight

01:11:00.566 --> 01:11:03.216
for control over their
family business and...

01:11:04.798 --> 01:11:07.022
I just feel lousy.

01:11:08.248 --> 01:11:09.841
Jack, you've been so busy

01:11:09.841 --> 01:11:11.916
trying to get Olivia to forgive you,

01:11:11.918 --> 01:11:13.701
that you forgot to forgive yourself,

01:11:14.185 --> 01:11:16.587
and you're never going to feel
quite right till you do that.

01:11:18.508 --> 01:11:20.638
You're a success story

01:11:20.927 --> 01:11:25.273
as long as you keep trying
and working to stay sober.

01:11:28.768 --> 01:11:31.335
I am a work in progress.

01:11:31.337 --> 01:11:33.021
Aren't we all?

01:11:37.329 --> 01:11:38.587
Hey.

01:11:39.099 --> 01:11:41.411
- What?
- What is your problem?

01:11:41.411 --> 01:11:42.898
You, at the moment.

01:11:42.898 --> 01:11:44.566
No, it's not me, it's you.

01:11:44.566 --> 01:11:45.875
You can't own up to the fact

01:11:45.875 --> 01:11:47.333
that you made a mistake about Luke.

01:11:47.334 --> 01:11:48.742
That's what this is between us.

01:11:48.742 --> 01:11:50.537
I thought I just didn't like you.

01:11:50.537 --> 01:11:52.258
No, you don't like what you did,

01:11:52.258 --> 01:11:53.573
but instead of doing the human thing and

01:11:53.574 --> 01:11:55.870
apologizing or saying,
"hey, I got this one wrong,"

01:11:55.870 --> 01:11:58.188
you're holding a stupid grudge against me.

01:11:58.698 --> 01:12:00.886
How many grudges you
got going at the moment?

01:12:00.999 --> 01:12:02.755
I'm guessing it's a lot.

01:12:02.902 --> 01:12:05.770
It's your loss. I would've
been a great roommate.

01:12:09.150 --> 01:12:10.683
So Norman's retiring?

01:12:10.684 --> 01:12:12.350
I'm working on it.

01:12:13.479 --> 01:12:15.363
Your first job as Town Manager.

01:12:15.365 --> 01:12:16.565
Yeah. I like it.

01:12:16.566 --> 01:12:18.050
Helping people with more

01:12:18.051 --> 01:12:19.982
than just finding the
latest author of the month.

01:12:19.982 --> 01:12:23.020
Like I said, you're gonna
make an amazing Town Manager.

01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:28.264
So I have something I have to tell you.

01:12:28.265 --> 01:12:30.886
Will decided to move back
to Cedar Cove for the summer.

01:12:31.191 --> 01:12:32.396
Yeah, how'd you know?

01:12:32.398 --> 01:12:33.898
I ran into him.

01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:36.447
Didn't punch him, though. I
get points for that. Right?

01:12:36.447 --> 01:12:37.792
Absolutely.

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:43.649
Well, a lot of obstacles out there.

01:12:43.649 --> 01:12:46.077
If it's not Will, it'd be something else.

01:12:46.079 --> 01:12:48.847
But you can't let him or
anything else throw you.

01:12:49.482 --> 01:12:51.351
Will has nothing to do with us.

01:12:52.118 --> 01:12:54.885
The only people who can
get in our way are us.

01:12:57.018 --> 01:12:58.584
Still have my ring?

01:12:59.225 --> 01:13:00.891
In my purse.

01:13:01.666 --> 01:13:04.395
I am looking forward to
seeing that on your hand...

01:13:04.884 --> 01:13:06.564
when you're ready.

01:13:14.759 --> 01:13:16.240
- Hi.
- Oh.

01:13:16.525 --> 01:13:18.331
Rebecca came to see me.

01:13:18.543 --> 01:13:19.744
Why?

01:13:19.746 --> 01:13:21.393
To tell me her side of the story.

01:13:21.393 --> 01:13:23.497
There's always two sides to every story.

01:13:23.499 --> 01:13:24.759
She doesn't follow the rules.

01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:26.267
She's a loose cannon.

01:13:26.269 --> 01:13:29.096
You haven't always
followed the rules either.

01:13:29.622 --> 01:13:31.138
Wow.

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:33.196
State of Washington versus Hollick.

01:13:33.196 --> 01:13:34.962
I lost this case.

01:13:34.963 --> 01:13:37.383
No, you forced a mistrial.

01:13:37.383 --> 01:13:38.673
That was a rumor.

01:13:38.674 --> 01:13:41.204
Well, rumor has it, if you
hadn't forced a mistrial,

01:13:41.205 --> 01:13:42.733
jeopardy would have attached,

01:13:42.735 --> 01:13:44.955
and a murderer would have gone free.

01:13:46.873 --> 01:13:48.539
I'm impressed.

01:13:48.541 --> 01:13:49.874
So am I.

01:13:49.876 --> 01:13:51.375
At your second trial,

01:13:51.377 --> 01:13:53.455
you were able to get back your lost witness

01:13:53.455 --> 01:13:56.464
and put a guilty man
where he belongs, prison,

01:13:56.466 --> 01:13:59.599
all because you didn't follow the rules.

01:14:02.355 --> 01:14:05.016
You don't find Rebecca annoying
because she argues with you,

01:14:05.017 --> 01:14:08.926
you find her annoying because
she reminds you of you.

01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:12.797
Well, you're certainly not wasting
that psychology minor, are you?

01:14:14.867 --> 01:14:16.717
Goodbye, Paul.

01:14:18.821 --> 01:14:20.971
Goodbye, Olivia.

01:14:22.408 --> 01:14:23.674
Thanks.

01:14:23.676 --> 01:14:25.325
Well, you were right, I was wrong.

01:14:25.326 --> 01:14:26.694
It wasn't fair.

01:14:26.985 --> 01:14:28.796
He just better be good.

01:14:29.834 --> 01:14:31.041
He is.

01:14:31.247 --> 01:14:32.450
Okay.

01:14:32.719 --> 01:14:33.919
I'm sorry.

01:14:34.076 --> 01:14:36.353
I'm not the one you need to say that to.

01:14:51.511 --> 01:14:52.720
Seth?

01:14:52.722 --> 01:14:54.186
Don't hang up.

01:14:58.578 --> 01:15:00.311
Am I allowed in?

01:15:00.313 --> 01:15:01.725
Sure.

01:15:02.444 --> 01:15:05.341
Look, I'm, ah, sorry about yesterday.

01:15:05.341 --> 01:15:07.643
No, I'm the one who came to apologize.

01:15:07.934 --> 01:15:09.877
I got so caught up in everything,

01:15:09.877 --> 01:15:11.889
I didn't listen to a word you said.

01:15:13.059 --> 01:15:16.094
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

01:15:16.094 --> 01:15:17.895
Thank you, Peggy.

01:15:17.897 --> 01:15:20.764
I'm not crazy about fighting
with people I don't like,

01:15:20.766 --> 01:15:22.233
much less the ones that I do.

01:15:22.235 --> 01:15:23.551
Me either!

01:15:23.553 --> 01:15:25.302
Come on in, guys,

01:15:25.304 --> 01:15:26.737
They all came to volunteer

01:15:26.739 --> 01:15:28.380
so you don't have to do it all yourself.

01:15:28.381 --> 01:15:29.891
I mean, that is,

01:15:29.962 --> 01:15:33.228
if you decided to possibly change
your mind and come back, please?

01:15:33.228 --> 01:15:35.913
Ah, you knew I was gonna
do this all along, right?

01:15:35.915 --> 01:15:37.264
I sure hoped so.

01:15:38.217 --> 01:15:39.733
Oh!

01:15:40.071 --> 01:15:41.426
Thank you!

01:15:41.427 --> 01:15:43.256
All right, come in and sit down, everyone.

01:15:43.257 --> 01:15:44.989
We'll come up with a plan of action.

01:15:44.991 --> 01:15:46.724
We're back!

01:15:49.462 --> 01:15:51.195
Cecilia!

01:15:51.197 --> 01:15:52.397
I know it's late.

01:15:52.398 --> 01:15:55.065
I wanted to come by
and thank you in person.

01:15:55.067 --> 01:15:56.725
I'm going to move to Port Orchard

01:15:56.725 --> 01:15:58.359
so I can be closer to Bremerton,

01:15:58.359 --> 01:16:01.505
that way, when Ian is on leave,
we can spend more time together,

01:16:01.507 --> 01:16:03.040
and his family is there,

01:16:03.042 --> 01:16:05.195
I'll need all the help
I can get with the baby.

01:16:05.519 --> 01:16:07.946
He wants us to be a family again.

01:16:08.341 --> 01:16:10.292
We're going to go to counseling.

01:16:11.083 --> 01:16:14.652
He told me, Olivia,
about the email you sent,

01:16:14.654 --> 01:16:17.021
about, well... about everything.

01:16:17.023 --> 01:16:19.223
What was the expression you used?

01:16:19.548 --> 01:16:22.330
"The importance of forgiveness."

01:16:22.331 --> 01:16:23.538
That's it.

01:16:24.497 --> 01:16:26.779
He's forgiven me and...

01:16:27.599 --> 01:16:29.349
well, it's all because of you.

01:16:29.402 --> 01:16:33.137
No, now, your persistence
played a big part in this, too.

01:16:34.941 --> 01:16:37.675
Cecilia, just... just a second.

01:16:37.677 --> 01:16:39.610
You're going to be a mother soon

01:16:39.612 --> 01:16:41.559
and that means

01:16:41.559 --> 01:16:43.324
someone else is going
to be depending on you

01:16:43.324 --> 01:16:46.735
to make good, smart life decisions.

01:16:47.458 --> 01:16:50.941
Now, I know that you're
a good, smart person...

01:16:51.283 --> 01:16:54.678
but I think it's time that
you started to think that, too.

01:16:54.827 --> 01:16:56.066
Okay.

01:16:56.112 --> 01:16:58.699
And I don't want to see
you back in my courtroom.

01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:00.380
I only want to see you here,

01:17:00.381 --> 01:17:04.099
in my house with your
husband and your new baby.

01:17:06.949 --> 01:17:08.632
Aww.

01:17:09.091 --> 01:17:11.564
I'll never forget what you did for me,

01:17:11.835 --> 01:17:13.065
for us.

01:17:15.477 --> 01:17:16.678
Hi, Jack.

01:17:16.679 --> 01:17:17.928
Cecilia.

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:19.767
Goodnight.

01:17:19.769 --> 01:17:20.990
Jack.

01:17:20.991 --> 01:17:23.241
Don't worry, I'm not here
to take away your space.

01:17:24.682 --> 01:17:27.689
I just wanted to drop off an early
edition of The Chronicle.

01:17:27.927 --> 01:17:29.960
I didn't want you to miss the editorial.

01:17:31.530 --> 01:17:32.745
Goodnight.

01:17:32.746 --> 01:17:34.165
Goodnight.

01:17:54.874 --> 01:17:56.408
Oh, Moon! Photo op.

01:17:56.409 --> 01:17:57.609
Oh!

01:17:57.610 --> 01:17:58.959
Tah-dah!

01:17:58.961 --> 01:18:01.709
- Mwah! We did it!
- Yes. That we did.

01:18:01.709 --> 01:18:03.764
And I couldn't have done it without you.

01:18:03.766 --> 01:18:06.831
Well, I wouldn't have done it
without you, and I thank you for that.

01:18:06.831 --> 01:18:08.713
- Aww.
- I like to be careful...

01:18:08.713 --> 01:18:11.210
...with my money, but it does feel good

01:18:11.210 --> 01:18:13.129
to let go of some of it
go every once in a while.

01:18:13.130 --> 01:18:14.942
- For a good cause.
- Aw.

01:18:17.246 --> 01:18:19.579
Rebecca... is back.

01:18:20.174 --> 01:18:22.154
On probation.

01:18:22.154 --> 01:18:24.538
She said that if she didn't
file the motion when she did,

01:18:24.538 --> 01:18:26.742
that she would've lost
a big piece of evidence.

01:18:26.742 --> 01:18:28.943
- Her side of the story.
- Yeah.

01:18:28.943 --> 01:18:32.093
And I told her, next time,
there better not be a next time.

01:18:32.862 --> 01:18:35.195
I need her to start coming
to me first. What?

01:18:35.195 --> 01:18:36.961
Well, if you want her to come to you first,

01:18:36.961 --> 01:18:39.249
you might try being a
little more approachable.

01:18:39.249 --> 01:18:40.684
I'm very approachable.

01:18:41.114 --> 01:18:42.390
In high school, I was voted

01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:45.364
"most likely to be approached," so...

01:18:45.844 --> 01:18:48.794
And... you approached
me, with no problem...

01:18:49.133 --> 01:18:50.677
I'm not Rebecca.

01:18:50.809 --> 01:18:52.713
No, you are not.

01:18:54.118 --> 01:18:56.458
So you're going to start work on Monday.

01:18:56.459 --> 01:18:58.135
What're you talking about?

01:18:58.137 --> 01:19:01.177
You're the new Thyme and
Tide guest relations manager.

01:19:01.177 --> 01:19:04.158
It's kind of like a concierge. Right, Bob?

01:19:04.416 --> 01:19:05.859
Uh... yeah.

01:19:06.518 --> 01:19:08.155
So what's this new job pay?

01:19:08.155 --> 01:19:10.585
Double the salary you made as Town Manager.

01:19:10.586 --> 01:19:11.865
You mean nothing?

01:19:11.867 --> 01:19:13.534
Er, yeah. That's correct.

01:19:13.847 --> 01:19:15.169
I'll take it.

01:19:15.171 --> 01:19:16.515
I'll see you bright and early.

01:19:16.515 --> 01:19:18.023
I got some ideas.

01:19:19.642 --> 01:19:21.114
He's like a boomerang.

01:19:21.538 --> 01:19:23.861
I send him to you, and you
send him right back to me.

01:19:23.863 --> 01:19:25.441
That's correct.

01:19:31.670 --> 01:19:33.053
That room is yours.

01:19:33.054 --> 01:19:35.246
If you still want it, that is.

01:19:35.246 --> 01:19:37.091
I can't believe she did that.

01:19:37.093 --> 01:19:39.379
- What?
- My mom talked to you?

01:19:39.379 --> 01:19:40.828
No.

01:19:40.830 --> 01:19:42.768
Then what's with the
sudden change of heart?

01:19:42.768 --> 01:19:44.965
- You're tough.
- I am.

01:19:44.967 --> 01:19:47.828
- Most people back down from me.
- I'm not most people.

01:19:47.828 --> 01:19:49.221
I get that.

01:19:49.397 --> 01:19:52.622
It'll, ah, still be weird
that I work with your mother.

01:19:52.622 --> 01:19:55.476
No weirder than the fact you tried
to put my boyfriend in prison.

01:19:55.478 --> 01:19:57.015
True enough.

01:19:57.277 --> 01:19:59.782
First, last, and security deposit.

01:19:59.783 --> 01:20:02.036
- Done.
- Okay.

01:20:07.541 --> 01:20:08.742
Well?

01:20:08.743 --> 01:20:09.944
I'm moving out.

01:20:10.859 --> 01:20:12.065
Yes!

01:20:12.066 --> 01:20:14.749
As long as I can get the first,
last, and the security deposit.

01:20:14.749 --> 01:20:16.146
You will.

01:20:16.217 --> 01:20:18.017
What makes you so sure?

01:20:18.199 --> 01:20:20.616
Because I know how amazing you are.

01:20:23.347 --> 01:20:25.038
I talked to Seth.

01:20:26.422 --> 01:20:27.975
Good.

01:20:38.523 --> 01:20:40.222
Sorry.

01:20:40.223 --> 01:20:42.471
Linnette, have you met my new ranch hand?

01:20:42.472 --> 01:20:43.679
No.

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:45.257
Linnette, this is Cal Pattenson.

01:20:45.258 --> 01:20:46.490
Hi.

01:20:49.231 --> 01:20:51.517
He's not much of a talker.

01:20:51.865 --> 01:20:55.118
I've been trying to figure
out a way to tell you.

01:20:55.543 --> 01:20:56.914
Tell me what?

01:20:58.017 --> 01:21:00.830
Someone from our past has contacted me.

01:21:01.625 --> 01:21:02.893
Who?

01:21:04.473 --> 01:21:06.117
Our child.

01:21:07.336 --> 01:21:09.847
Our child from the past?

01:21:11.470 --> 01:21:13.455
The child we gave up for adoption.

01:21:14.761 --> 01:21:16.657
The child I gave up.

01:21:29.133 --> 01:21:30.789
"If making mistakes is something

01:21:30.790 --> 01:21:34.296
"we all have in common, so
is the ability to forgive.

01:21:34.510 --> 01:21:38.920
"It's my hope that those whom I
have hurt in the past can forgive me.

01:21:39.372 --> 01:21:42.197
"And I hope even more that someday...

01:21:42.383 --> 01:21:44.999
"I can forgive myself."

01:21:57.085 --> 01:21:58.556
I miss you.

01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:01.968
I miss us.

01:22:04.258 --> 01:22:06.081
I miss...

01:22:06.876 --> 01:22:08.576
sunsets.

01:22:09.696 --> 01:22:10.974
Chinese food...

01:22:13.930 --> 01:22:15.958
Waking up next to you.

01:22:21.477 --> 01:22:23.354
I miss your perfume.

01:22:24.919 --> 01:22:27.478
I miss... fighting

01:22:27.733 --> 01:22:28.933
and...

01:22:28.934 --> 01:22:30.754
I miss making up.

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:34.928
I miss it all.

01:22:38.072 --> 01:22:40.249
I miss you, too.

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:44.935
Well, why are we sitting here,
missing each other, then, huh?

01:22:49.791 --> 01:22:51.583
Let's start over.

01:22:54.686 --> 01:22:56.352
I love you...

01:22:56.974 --> 01:22:58.624
but no.

01:23:00.311 --> 01:23:01.542
No?

01:23:01.695 --> 01:23:03.565
I don't want to start over.

01:23:04.416 --> 01:23:06.573
I want us to move forward.

01:23:07.434 --> 01:23:09.001
Together.

01:23:10.437 --> 01:23:12.654
I want us to move in together.

01:23:15.770 --> 01:23:18.243
On an all new Cedar Cove...

01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:20.529
You know what I see?

01:23:21.681 --> 01:23:22.881
Jack!

01:23:22.906 --> 01:23:24.645
I didn't cause this situation...

01:23:25.336 --> 01:23:26.536
You did!

01:23:26.716 --> 01:23:29.447
I have no credit, I have no
signing ability for checks...

01:23:29.556 --> 01:23:30.786
or vote to power of attorney... you know,

01:23:30.786 --> 01:23:32.801
it feels like it's my sixteenth
birthday all over again.

01:23:32.801 --> 01:23:36.355
I am promoting you to assistant editor.

01:23:37.614 --> 01:23:39.946
Do you trust him? Can you trust him?
