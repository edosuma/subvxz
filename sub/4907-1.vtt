00:46.872 --> 00:48.840
My name's Ramona Q.

00:48.940 --> 00:53.400
I'm nine and three months, and no matter
what my sister Beezus tells you...

00:53.512 --> 00:55.104
I'm not a pest.

00:55.213 --> 00:59.707
My dad says I just have an overactive
imagination, which does come in handy.

00:59.818 --> 01:03.754
It makes the fun parts funner
and the scary parts scarier.

01:03.855 --> 01:07.154
And frankly, it's good
to scare yourself once in a while...

01:07.259 --> 01:09.193
'cause if you can't be brave at recess...

01:09.294 --> 01:11.228
how can you do it when it really counts?

01:11.330 --> 01:13.924
Okay, stay with me. You can do it, Ramona.

01:17.769 --> 01:20.761
I'll never make it, Howie. Whoa.

01:21.907 --> 01:23.772
Owie, owie.

01:23.875 --> 01:27.675
That's my echo off the canyon,
canyon, canyon.

01:27.779 --> 01:31.010
Don't psych yourself out, Ramona.
Just don't look down.

01:39.558 --> 01:41.389
It's too far!

01:41.493 --> 01:44.587
Far! Far! Far!

02:00.445 --> 02:04.313
Howie, help!

02:04.416 --> 02:06.748
- Mrs. Meacham?

02:06.852 --> 02:10.413
Uh, Ramona's kind of hung up.

02:13.158 --> 02:16.150
- Help, please.

02:16.261 --> 02:19.424
- Quiet. Face front.

02:19.531 --> 02:21.726
Ah! Help.

02:21.833 --> 02:24.097
Eyes forward. Lock it down.

02:26.938 --> 02:31.341
Ramona Quimby, get down from there.
This isn't a circus.

02:42.120 --> 02:45.487
You should have seen it
through a window. It was awesome.

02:45.590 --> 02:49.617
You looked like a pinata.
Well, obviously without all the candy.

02:49.728 --> 02:52.253
It made me really dizzy,
yet I wanna do it again.

02:52.364 --> 02:55.231
- Race you home, mudball.

03:00.372 --> 03:02.203
- I won!
- See you tomorrow.

03:02.307 --> 03:04.207
- Bye, Howie.
- Excuse me.

03:06.845 --> 03:10.110
- Ramona.

03:10.215 --> 03:12.149
Be more careful with Willa Jean.

03:12.250 --> 03:14.548
- Huh?
- She's younger than you are.

03:14.653 --> 03:16.951
- Ha-ha!

03:17.055 --> 03:18.750
- Ow.
- Willa Jean, come to Grammy.

03:38.276 --> 03:41.245
Mom, look it. I taught Roberta
how to stick out her tongue.

03:41.346 --> 03:44.372
That's great, sweetie.
Now I can cancel the private tutor.

03:44.483 --> 03:48.078
- Next, can you teach her
how to change her own diaper?

03:48.186 --> 03:50.416
Could you set the table, please, Ramona?

03:50.522 --> 03:53.286
And add another plate for Aunt Bea.
She's coming by later for dessert.

03:53.391 --> 03:55.086
- So five altogether?
- Yep.

03:55.193 --> 03:56.990
I was about to do that.

03:57.095 --> 04:00.553
Hmm. Being about to do it and doing it.

04:03.168 --> 04:07.696
- Mom! Beezus is acting all French again.

04:07.806 --> 04:09.706
Dad's home!

04:16.047 --> 04:18.481
Daddy!

04:19.718 --> 04:22.084
Prepare for impact!

04:23.588 --> 04:25.783
- Hi, honey!
- Dad!

04:25.891 --> 04:28.951
Hey! How are my beautiful girls?
Mwah!

04:29.060 --> 04:31.358
- Did you crunch the numbers, Dad?
- You bet I did, Pickle.

04:31.463 --> 04:33.693
- I crunched them good. Real good.

04:33.798 --> 04:35.527
- The whole darn day.

04:35.634 --> 04:37.602
I don't think you got dirty enough today,
Ramona.

04:37.702 --> 04:39.602
Well, there's always tomorrow.

04:39.704 --> 04:41.672
- Mwah!
- I'll let you two catch up.

04:41.773 --> 04:45.209
There's my little girl.
My little bowling ball with Legs.

04:45.310 --> 04:48.177
- Sorry about that, Icky Sticky.

04:48.280 --> 04:52.182
Dad, it's Picky Picky.

04:52.284 --> 04:56.653
- When are you ever gonna learn
his real name?
- When he learns mine.

04:56.755 --> 05:00.748
So, Beezus, suppose I told you that when l
pulled up in front of the house tonight...

05:00.859 --> 05:04.795
I saw your old buddy Henry staring at it like
he left something important inside.

05:04.896 --> 05:07.160
Henry Huggins?
I haven't heard that name in a while.

05:07.265 --> 05:09.290
Isn't he the boy
that used to eat dirt in the backyard?

05:09.401 --> 05:11.232
- Yeah.
- He doesn't do that anymore.

05:11.336 --> 05:14.100
Ooh. If I didn't know better,
I'd say somebody has a crush.

05:14.205 --> 05:17.072
- Ooh-ooh!
- Can we please talk about something else?

05:17.175 --> 05:20.508
- There is that dance.
Maybe he wants to ask you to it.

05:20.612 --> 05:23.672
Well, if he's gonna ask my girl to a dance,
he'd better have some moves.

05:23.782 --> 05:25.841
Can the old dirt-eater do this?

05:25.951 --> 05:28.943
Ooh-hoo, whoo-hoo!

05:29.054 --> 05:31.249
Oh, I hope not. Stop.

05:31.356 --> 05:32.880
- Mom!

05:32.991 --> 05:35.084
What do we got here? Note from the bank.

05:35.193 --> 05:37.661
It could be loan papers for the addition.

05:37.762 --> 05:41.027
- Hope they don't expect us to pay it back.
- Well, banks are funny that way.

05:41.132 --> 05:44.898
What do we got here?
"To the Parents of Beatrice Quimby."

05:45.003 --> 05:47.699
Could this be the latest report card?

05:50.842 --> 05:52.810
"Beatrice Quimby gets in fights...

05:52.911 --> 05:55.402
"steals from the vending machines,
counterfeits hall passes.

05:55.513 --> 05:58.243
- Wait. Let me see.
- We recommend juvenile prison. "

05:58.350 --> 06:01.342
All A's.

06:01.453 --> 06:03.614
- We're so proud of you.

06:03.722 --> 06:06.919
- It's not funny.

06:10.629 --> 06:13.792
So, Ramona, Beatrice has her report card.

06:13.898 --> 06:17.163
Doesn't that mean-
I don't know- you should have one too?

06:17.268 --> 06:19.736
That old thing?

06:19.838 --> 06:23.638
Yeah, that old thing.
Where would that old thing happen to be?

06:37.489 --> 06:40.617
- That's a good place for it.
- Yeah, wouldn't want it to spoil.

06:45.630 --> 06:47.097
Oh.

06:51.970 --> 06:54.666
"Ramona is a bright young student"-

06:54.773 --> 06:57.708
That's my girl. "... but lacks focus...

06:57.809 --> 07:00.642
"often daydreams,
disputes the need to spell words correctly...

07:00.745 --> 07:03.942
"and has very little respect
for the rules of grammar...

07:04.049 --> 07:06.017
or rules in general."

07:11.222 --> 07:13.816
- Oh.
- Why would she write this, Ramona?

07:13.925 --> 07:17.656
Because... she's no fun.

07:17.762 --> 07:21.323
- That is no excuse.
- But it's true.

07:21.433 --> 07:25.529
She makes us all use
the same words from the same list.

07:25.637 --> 07:29.801
And when I try to be original,
she just shoots me down.

07:29.908 --> 07:32.376
Like when I invented the word "terrifical."

07:32.477 --> 07:35.139
She goes, "Ramona, that's not a word."

07:35.246 --> 07:37.874
And I say, "It's a lot funner word to say."

07:37.982 --> 07:40.348
She goes, "Funner isn't a word either."

07:40.452 --> 07:42.511
What kind of teacher is that?

07:42.620 --> 07:45.384
She can't tell kids not to invent words.

07:45.490 --> 07:47.890
She's not the president of the world.

07:47.992 --> 07:51.086
- You butt out, Beezus.

07:51.196 --> 07:53.289
Ramona, Mrs. Meacham is your teacher.

07:53.398 --> 07:55.992
- You need to listen to her.
- And she's not that bad.

07:56.101 --> 07:58.695
She was fair with me when I was your age.

07:58.803 --> 08:00.668
Yeah, well-

08:00.772 --> 08:02.672
Everybody loves Beezus...

08:02.774 --> 08:04.901
and everybody hates me!

08:05.009 --> 08:06.271
- Okay.

08:06.377 --> 08:09.574
- Why are you laughing?
- We're not laughing, sweetie.

08:12.517 --> 08:14.485
I'm gonna say a bad word.

08:16.521 --> 08:19.547
- You are?
- Mm-hmm.

08:19.657 --> 08:21.557
A really bad one.

08:21.659 --> 08:25.595
Well, if you feel the need to get one
out of your system, then go ahead.

08:34.304 --> 08:35.932
- Guts!

08:37.509 --> 08:40.534
- Guts, guts, guts!

08:42.679 --> 08:46.548
- "G" word.
- That's your idea of a bad word, Ramona?

08:54.526 --> 08:56.494
Honey, I'm sorry we laughed.

08:59.898 --> 09:01.365
- Hey.

09:23.454 --> 09:24.785
Oh, oh, oh.

09:26.891 --> 09:29.121
What's she done?

09:32.430 --> 09:35.092
- Oh, guts!

09:42.473 --> 09:43.474
Hey, babe. How's the air up there?

09:43.474 --> 09:44.566
Hey, babe. How's the air up there?

09:44.676 --> 09:46.667
Hi, Aunt Bea.

09:46.778 --> 09:48.837
Aw, you can do better than that.

09:48.947 --> 09:51.415
- Where's the love? Honk, honk.

09:53.852 --> 09:55.843
I thought I'd find you here.

09:55.954 --> 09:59.117
That was a fine job you did
on the toothpaste.

09:59.224 --> 10:01.658
You must have a really strong grip.

10:01.759 --> 10:03.659
Oh!

10:03.761 --> 10:05.729
Let me see those calluses.

10:08.266 --> 10:09.494
Oh, yeah.

10:09.601 --> 10:12.866
all that time on the jungle gym
sure is paying off.

10:12.971 --> 10:16.702
Did that one get bigger?
Tremendous. Trophy size.

10:19.878 --> 10:21.573
You know...

10:22.947 --> 10:26.906
I was a younger sister, too, once. Still am.

10:27.018 --> 10:30.146
No matter how old I get,
I'll always be younger.

10:32.790 --> 10:34.758
It's no fair, Aunt Bea.

10:35.927 --> 10:38.725
I never do anything as good as Beezus.

10:40.031 --> 10:43.865
- And Roberta, if she burps, it's adorable.
- Hmm.

10:43.968 --> 10:47.267
Last week,
she poured applesauce on her head...

10:47.372 --> 10:51.035
- and Dad stopped to take pictures.
- Oh!

10:51.142 --> 10:55.977
I mean, when it's my turn to do stuff...

10:56.080 --> 10:58.048
nobody even cares.

10:58.149 --> 11:01.744
Well, it's impossible to compete
with pouring food on your head.

11:01.853 --> 11:03.821
Why do we even bother?

11:04.889 --> 11:06.754
You know what? I bet it would be nice...

11:06.858 --> 11:09.383
to have something of your own for once.

11:09.494 --> 11:11.792
Like my own room?

11:11.896 --> 11:15.593
Maybe just something small...

11:15.700 --> 11:17.668
you could always have with you.

11:21.406 --> 11:23.465
Go ahead. Open it.

11:31.749 --> 11:34.149
I found that picture the other day...

11:34.252 --> 11:38.416
and I realized I was exactly your age,
so I wanted you to have it.

11:38.523 --> 11:40.548
- That's you?
- Yeah.

11:40.658 --> 11:44.150
There's room for another if you wanna
give that little girl some company.

11:44.262 --> 11:46.662
- Thank you, Aunt Bea.
- Mm-hmm.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.534
I want you to know...

11:51.636 --> 11:54.298
that you will always have me around.

11:57.075 --> 11:58.770
- Aw.
- Whoo!

11:58.876 --> 12:01.401
You okay?

12:01.512 --> 12:04.003
- I gotcha.

12:05.249 --> 12:07.240
Mmm. I gotcha.

12:12.824 --> 12:15.520
- Bring it up!

12:15.626 --> 12:17.560
Beezus, wake up!

12:17.662 --> 12:19.823
Beezus, come on.

12:26.204 --> 12:29.833
- To the right.

12:34.579 --> 12:36.945
Check it out, man.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.181
Ramona!

12:48.092 --> 12:50.560
- Okay. We're clear.

12:56.834 --> 12:58.699
- Whoo-hoo!

12:58.803 --> 12:59.770
- Whoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

13:05.843 --> 13:07.640
- Whoa!

13:18.456 --> 13:20.447
Control tower, we've reached 30,000 feet.

13:20.558 --> 13:23.391
Ramona, you are clear for airdrop.

13:23.494 --> 13:26.258
Whoo-hoo!

13:30.701 --> 13:33.898
- Whoo!

13:46.117 --> 13:50.178
Whoa! Whoo!

13:50.288 --> 13:51.915
Whoa!

13:54.559 --> 13:57.585
- This is the best day ever!
- Whoo-hoo!

13:57.695 --> 14:00.095
Yeah. I wish we had a hole in our house.

14:00.198 --> 14:02.098
Hey, Ramona, let's make a deal.

14:02.200 --> 14:05.226
If you can settle down for a few hours,
I'll see if Dad can take us out to dinner.

14:05.336 --> 14:07.736
- Really?

14:07.839 --> 14:10.239
Can we go to Macaroni Joe's?

14:10.341 --> 14:12.536
- There is an inch of dust
covering my whole kitchen.

14:12.643 --> 14:14.770
- We can go anywhere.
- Yeah!

14:14.879 --> 14:16.244
Whoo!

14:16.347 --> 14:18.542
I'm having a hair crisis.

14:18.649 --> 14:21.777
But it looks the same as always.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.344
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

14:25.389 --> 14:27.050
- He's home!

14:36.367 --> 14:37.857
- Dad.
- Hey.

14:37.969 --> 14:39.300
Daddy!

14:39.403 --> 14:41.701
- Boing!
- Ohh!

14:41.806 --> 14:43.933
- Did you crunch the numbers, Dad?

14:44.041 --> 14:46.737
Well, today they kind of crunched me back.

14:47.778 --> 14:50.269
But I got you a little surprise.

14:51.682 --> 14:53.616
Why don't you and Beez
go outside and share those...

14:53.718 --> 14:57.415
and I'll talk to your mom for a minute, okay?

14:57.522 --> 14:59.752
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

15:13.738 --> 15:16.298
- Something's wrong.

15:16.407 --> 15:18.568
They let three people go last week.

15:18.676 --> 15:20.473
How can you tell?

15:20.578 --> 15:22.443
'Cause they're whispering.

15:24.682 --> 15:26.616
Did I do something wrong?

15:26.717 --> 15:28.116
No.

15:28.219 --> 15:30.619
Not this time.

15:30.721 --> 15:34.452
But something tells me
that we're not going to Macaroni Joe's.

15:40.898 --> 15:43.059
Hey, you got more red ones.

15:43.167 --> 15:45.192
all right. Take a few more.

15:45.303 --> 15:48.033
Remember how I taught you to eat them.

15:48.139 --> 15:50.972
- Bite the head off first?
- Yep.

15:51.075 --> 15:53.100
It's more humane that way.

15:54.812 --> 15:57.042
You don't deserve to be downsized.

16:00.484 --> 16:04.079
"Downsized"? What's that mean?

16:05.189 --> 16:07.214
Well, um...

16:07.325 --> 16:10.055
it means the storage company
was bought by a bigger one...

16:10.161 --> 16:14.188
and a lot of people were let go,
including Dad.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.927
The good news is
I called Dr. Perry's office...

16:18.035 --> 16:20.094
and she has some part-time work
for me again...

16:20.204 --> 16:23.173
so that should tide us over
for a little while, at least.

16:24.375 --> 16:26.673
Don't worry. I will find a job.

16:26.777 --> 16:28.836
But in the meantime...

16:28.946 --> 16:32.006
I got a little extra time
to spend with my girls.

16:32.116 --> 16:33.583
Right?

16:35.586 --> 16:36.780
- Right?
- Right.

16:36.887 --> 16:38.115
- Okay.
- Right.

16:41.158 --> 16:43.422
You realize we're gonna be poor now, right?

16:43.527 --> 16:45.791
No, we're not.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.998
- Are we?
- Have you seen how many bills they get?

16:50.101 --> 16:53.502
It's insane.
Everything costs money, even water.

16:53.604 --> 16:56.266
Well, Mom's gonna make money.

16:56.374 --> 17:00.071
And Dad, he'll be with us.

17:00.177 --> 17:01.644
That part's fun.

17:01.746 --> 17:04.476
Well, get ready for another year
in hand-me-down heaven.

17:04.582 --> 17:07.550
Hey, lights out, my lovelies.

17:07.652 --> 17:09.586
Sweet dreams.

17:20.330 --> 17:22.265
Beezus?

17:24.201 --> 17:27.829
It's sort of scary
having a hole in the house...

17:27.938 --> 17:29.405
don't you think?

17:29.507 --> 17:32.738
- Beezus.
- Shh. I'm trying to sleep.

17:35.613 --> 17:37.706
Beezus, did you hear that growling?

17:37.815 --> 17:40.978
It's probably just your stomach, doofus.

17:43.054 --> 17:44.578
Unless-

17:45.756 --> 17:49.123
Unless it's something...

17:49.226 --> 17:50.454
else.

17:50.561 --> 17:52.552
Beezus, stop it.

17:52.663 --> 17:55.757
- Like a ferocious, hungry-
- Stop!

17:55.866 --> 17:59.199
slithering beast that feeds
on pests with bad report cards.

17:59.303 --> 18:01.533
- Ah!

18:01.639 --> 18:04.665
You're too easy.

18:04.775 --> 18:06.709
Beezus, it's not funny.

18:06.811 --> 18:08.711
I thought it was.

18:08.813 --> 18:10.280
Bring it up.

18:13.617 --> 18:15.585
Let me get a pen, write it down.

18:15.686 --> 18:17.620
- Both girls
get carrots and sandwiches.
- Okay.

18:17.722 --> 18:21.522
Beezus wants hers in a Ziploc,
and Ramona insists on having tin foil.

18:21.625 --> 18:24.822
She claims it affects the taste, but I think
she just likes making sculptures with it.

18:24.929 --> 18:28.456
What else? Ramona wants
a hard-boiled egg if we have any.

18:28.566 --> 18:30.557
Think fast.

18:30.668 --> 18:33.364
Please tell me you're
gonna remember all this.

18:33.471 --> 18:35.803
Look at me- fully domesticated.

18:35.906 --> 18:38.807
I've lined up Mrs. Kemp
to watch Roberta at noon.

18:38.909 --> 18:42.470
- all you have to do
is go nail this interview today.
- How do I look?

18:44.115 --> 18:47.414
- I'd give you the job.
- Really?

18:47.518 --> 18:48.883
I'd take it.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.887
- Ew!
- Ew!

18:59.397 --> 19:02.332
Ramona, did I ever show you the proper way...

19:02.433 --> 19:05.095
to crack a hard-boiled egg?

19:05.202 --> 19:06.533
Mm-mmm.

19:07.638 --> 19:08.866
Hmm-hmm.

19:20.050 --> 19:22.041
You are so weird.

19:24.321 --> 19:27.085
- A guy's gotta get his protein somehow.

19:27.191 --> 19:30.354
- See, I got this stuff down.

19:38.602 --> 19:41.162
Hey, Ramona, wait up!

19:41.272 --> 19:43.968
- Bye, Dad!
- Bye-bye!

19:52.683 --> 19:55.413
- Nice doodles.

19:55.519 --> 19:58.920
They're not doodles. They're sketches.

19:59.023 --> 20:01.082
My dad's extremely sketchy.

20:01.192 --> 20:03.319
- Is everyone in their seats?

20:03.427 --> 20:05.395
I'm about to round the corner.

20:05.496 --> 20:07.396
And good morning.

20:07.498 --> 20:11.935
I trust you all survived the weekend
with most of your limbs intact.

20:12.036 --> 20:14.766
It's time we tackle our class reports.

20:14.872 --> 20:16.999
Tell us about something
special in your life...

20:17.107 --> 20:19.735
using at least one word
from our vocabulary list.

20:21.245 --> 20:23.736
This is my ballet tiara.

20:23.848 --> 20:24.974
Ooh.

20:25.082 --> 20:27.983
This is a saddle for riding camels.

20:28.085 --> 20:31.077
It's special to me
because I'm going to wear my tiara...

20:31.188 --> 20:34.419
when I audition for the part of the princess
in the Royal Peanut Butter commercials.

20:34.525 --> 20:37.187
And it's special because
my Uncle Hobart gave it to me.

20:37.294 --> 20:39.592
I think I'd be extraordinary in the role.

20:39.697 --> 20:42.097
E-X-T-R-A-O-R-D-I-N-A-R-Y.

20:42.199 --> 20:44.463
And he travels all over the world...

20:44.568 --> 20:47.435
taking pictures of animals
in their natural habitat.

20:47.538 --> 20:49.699
H-A-B-I-T-A-T.

20:49.807 --> 20:54.335
Extraordinary.
That's when you take something... ordinary...

20:56.213 --> 20:58.204
- and give it a little extra.

20:58.315 --> 21:01.614
- So, does anybody wanna sit on it?
- Yeah!

21:01.719 --> 21:05.211
- Okay, Ramona, let's hear it.
- Why, thank you, Mrs. Meacham.

21:13.497 --> 21:16.193
- Shh.

21:18.135 --> 21:21.571
Mute button. Mute button.
What am I doing? I'm muting you.

21:21.672 --> 21:23.503
Ramona, go on.

21:23.607 --> 21:26.770
Well, the most special thing in my life...

21:26.877 --> 21:29.903
is that some nice workmen in blue helmets...

21:30.014 --> 21:31.845
- came to my house this week-
- Shh.

21:31.949 --> 21:35.407
- and chopped a great big hole in it.

21:36.754 --> 21:39.052
But-But they did.

21:39.156 --> 21:42.182
It was so big, I could see all of Portland.

21:44.328 --> 21:47.058
Howie knows.
Howie came and jumped through the hole.

21:47.164 --> 21:48.995
Um-

21:49.099 --> 21:50.430
He did.

21:50.534 --> 21:53.002
- That's enough now.

21:53.103 --> 21:55.537
- I think the hole's in her head.

21:55.639 --> 21:57.539
- Show's over, Ramona.
- She's such a liar.

21:57.641 --> 21:59.734
- Mrs. Meacham, I'm not lying.
- Take your seat.

21:59.843 --> 22:03.904
Go ahead. Take your seat. The purpose
of this exercise is not to entertain us.

22:04.014 --> 22:06.915
No embellishments, please.

22:07.017 --> 22:09.451
Now, who would like to go next? Hands?

22:11.021 --> 22:13.148
You saw them chop the hole in my house.

22:13.257 --> 22:17.216
Actually, no. They pried it with crowbars.

22:17.328 --> 22:20.354
Technically, they pried it.

22:20.464 --> 22:22.489
That's what I meant.

22:22.600 --> 22:24.659
Now Mrs. Meacham thinks I'm a liar...

22:24.768 --> 22:27.635
and she's gonna tell my mom and dad
I'm a big troublemaker tonight.

22:27.738 --> 22:29.638
Well, you are sometimes.

22:29.740 --> 22:32.038
I mean, technically, you are.

22:32.142 --> 22:34.610
Maybe you should technically look
for a new best frlend.

22:34.712 --> 22:38.113
- Hey! How you doing there, chief?

22:38.215 --> 22:40.080
Who's your girlfrlend?

22:40.184 --> 22:42.277
G- I'm not his girlfrlend.

22:42.386 --> 22:45.651
She's not my girlfrlend.
She's Ramona, and she lives over there.

22:45.756 --> 22:47.849
Ramona.

22:47.958 --> 22:52.019
# Ramona and Howie are sitting in a tree #

22:52.129 --> 22:54.757
# They are K-l-S-S-l-N-G ##

22:55.366 --> 22:57.197
Wait a second.

22:57.301 --> 22:59.394
Ramona Quimby? Huh.

22:59.503 --> 23:02.233
Hey, I'm Hobart. I'm Howie's favorite uncle.

23:02.339 --> 23:04.170
No? Oh. Sorry.

23:04.274 --> 23:07.766
Yeah. We all heard about it.

23:07.878 --> 23:11.678
Oh, really? Well, how's that beautiful
Aunt Beatrice of yours doing?

23:11.782 --> 23:15.843
You be sure to tell her I'd love to catch up,
all right?

23:18.589 --> 23:20.921
Hey, Howie, how'd the saddle work out?

23:21.025 --> 23:22.959
Did you get an "A "?

23:26.797 --> 23:31.632
Dad? Does Aunt Bea really know
some weird guy named Hobart?

23:31.735 --> 23:35.193
Hobart? That's a name
I haven't heard in quite a while.

23:35.305 --> 23:38.763
Yeah, they were high school sweethearts,
old Hobart and Bea.

23:39.710 --> 23:43.043
Him? But he's not even her type.

23:43.147 --> 23:45.206
And what would that type be?

23:46.316 --> 23:47.476
Perfect.

23:49.753 --> 23:51.482
Hmm.

23:51.588 --> 23:54.022
Oh, I'm afraid to look. Bills, bills, bills.

23:54.124 --> 23:56.217
It never ends, Pickle.

23:56.326 --> 23:58.317
Did you get the job today?

23:58.429 --> 24:01.830
- Well, I didn't get this one.
- Oh.

24:03.033 --> 24:06.400
'Cause I was thinking.
I've got the perfect job.

24:06.503 --> 24:09.700
- What?
- You should be a fireman.

24:09.807 --> 24:11.798
Oh. Yeah?

24:11.909 --> 24:14.707
Yes. You would save people's lives...

24:14.812 --> 24:17.337
and climb gigantic ladders.

24:17.448 --> 24:19.712
And if it was a night alarm...

24:19.817 --> 24:23.048
you would get to put your fire suit on
over your pajamas.

24:23.153 --> 24:26.748
- Whoa.
- It's true, Dad. I took a field trip.

24:26.857 --> 24:29.189
Well, I wanna work in my pajamas...

24:29.293 --> 24:33.252
but I think you're overestimating
my job skills a little bit.

24:33.363 --> 24:34.990
I'm not that versatile.

24:35.799 --> 24:37.232
- Dad.
- What?

24:37.334 --> 24:40.599
I think you can do anything. Don't you?

24:41.638 --> 24:43.333
Well-

24:43.440 --> 24:44.873
- Hi! I'm home!

24:44.975 --> 24:47.739
- We need to be there by 5:00, honey.
- Oh.

24:47.845 --> 24:51.406
I've heard those parent-teacher meetings
can be really boring.

24:51.515 --> 24:53.676
They make your brain numb,
they're that boring.

24:53.784 --> 24:57.777
- Nice try, Ramona. We're going.
- Yeah. Good one, Pickle.

24:57.888 --> 25:00.584
Honey, I wanna call the bank tomorrow
and cancel the loan.

25:00.691 --> 25:02.886
Bob, there's a gaping hole in the house.

25:02.993 --> 25:05.257
I don't think we have much choice.

25:05.362 --> 25:08.729
We're in over our heads.
Let's wait till we're on our feet.

25:08.832 --> 25:11.392
Beezus, what are they talking about?

25:11.502 --> 25:13.595
- We just have to finish it.

25:13.704 --> 25:16.867
Hey. And if we default? I'd rather sell it
than let the bank take the house.

25:16.974 --> 25:19.841
Bank take the house. Bank take the house.

26:04.021 --> 26:07.457
- Our house.

26:07.558 --> 26:09.685
- Can we just talk
about this later, Bob?
- Okay, fine.

26:09.793 --> 26:11.260
- We're late.
- Mom, wait.

26:11.361 --> 26:15.229
No more stalling. We're meeting with
Mrs. Meacham, end of story.

26:15.332 --> 26:16.993
- Hmm?
- Be good, lovelies.

26:17.100 --> 26:19.364
- Mwah!
- And be good for Aunt Bea tonight.

26:19.469 --> 26:21.460
We're off to numb our brains.

26:23.040 --> 26:25.634
Beezus, where's the bank
gonna take our house?

26:25.742 --> 26:29.109
It's just an expression, genius.
They don't take it anywhere.

26:29.213 --> 26:31.613
- Oh.
- They just sell it to someone else.

26:31.715 --> 26:33.410
- What?

26:33.517 --> 26:35.007
- I got it.

26:35.118 --> 26:37.848
- Hello. Oh, hi, Henry.
- Beezus, we can't move.

26:37.955 --> 26:40.253
This is our house. We belong here.

26:40.357 --> 26:42.325
I-I don't want us
to leave Klickitat Street.

26:42.426 --> 26:44.394
Ramona, I am on the phone.

26:49.600 --> 26:51.830
Aunt Bea!

26:51.935 --> 26:55.302
- Can I- Can I ask you something?
- Shh. Just a minute, babe.

27:00.310 --> 27:05.338
- What's wrong?
- I just thought
I recognized someone out there.

27:05.449 --> 27:08.543
Oh. You mean Hobart. Hmm.

27:08.652 --> 27:10.916
Sounds like you've met him.

27:11.021 --> 27:12.921
He said he wants to catch up with you.

27:13.023 --> 27:14.650
You're kidding.

27:14.758 --> 27:16.555
- He said that to you?
- Mm-hmm.

27:16.660 --> 27:20.187
Well, that's just- That's just classic.

27:27.304 --> 27:30.762
Aunt Bea, can I ask you something?

27:30.874 --> 27:33.104
I think the bank's gonna take our house.

27:34.611 --> 27:36.977
- Aunt Bea?
- Huh?

27:37.080 --> 27:39.207
- Are you listening?
- Hmm?

27:39.316 --> 27:41.443
Oh. I'm sorry.

27:41.551 --> 27:44.486
I just-
How do I put this?

27:44.588 --> 27:48.354
- Um, you know those calluses on your hands?
- Yeah.

27:48.458 --> 27:52.758
Mm-hmm. How the skin gets tough
to protect a spot that got hurt?

27:52.863 --> 27:56.128
I have one of those on my heart
from a really long time ago.

27:56.233 --> 27:59.031
And if he thinks he can just come back here
and start picking at it...

27:59.136 --> 28:01.036
he is sadly mistaken.

28:04.708 --> 28:07.871
I guess you're the only one left to talk to.

28:07.978 --> 28:10.776
I'm sorry for pulling your tail
when I was little...

28:10.881 --> 28:14.544
and for trying to teach you
how to play catch...

28:14.651 --> 28:16.915
and for dressing you up as an astronaut.

28:17.020 --> 28:19.352
- I know you're really old...

28:19.456 --> 28:21.424
so I'm gonna say this gently.

28:21.525 --> 28:23.823
We're in a lot of trouble, Picky Picky.

28:23.927 --> 28:25.861
We need money.

28:25.963 --> 28:27.954
And we might lose our house.

28:28.065 --> 28:30.056
- But don't worry, okay?

28:30.167 --> 28:32.567
I'm gonna help.

28:32.669 --> 28:35.570
Nobody thinks I can, but I can.

28:36.606 --> 28:38.665
I can be extraordinary.

28:38.775 --> 28:42.142
- I'm glad we agree.

28:46.783 --> 28:48.478
Whoa.

28:48.585 --> 28:51.110
Whoo!

28:52.522 --> 28:53.921
Whoo!

29:01.098 --> 29:04.499
Ramona, why is my desk on the lawn?

29:04.601 --> 29:06.569
It's a secret.

29:08.138 --> 29:12.097
Okay, fine. I'll tell you.
I'm saving the house for Mom and Dad.

29:12.209 --> 29:15.042
Is that Great-Grandma's crystal?

29:15.145 --> 29:17.045
Ramona, we never use that.

29:17.147 --> 29:20.116
I know. We're gonna make
so much money today, Beezus.

29:20.217 --> 29:22.344
Now, if you wanna join the team...

29:22.452 --> 29:25.979
I could always use
a hard-working sales assoclate.

29:28.158 --> 29:31.218
Um, is that "delicious"?

29:32.863 --> 29:34.558
- Mm-hmm!
- Ah.

29:34.664 --> 29:36.393
Ooh! Customer!

29:36.500 --> 29:37.990
Customer!

29:38.101 --> 29:41.070
Ramona, please, please, please,
don't call him over-

29:41.171 --> 29:43.605
Hey, Henry, you look thirsty!

29:43.707 --> 29:45.607
- Hi.
- Hi, Henry.

29:46.643 --> 29:48.474
Hey, Beezus.

29:48.578 --> 29:50.842
Hi.

29:52.315 --> 29:55.580
- Selling lemonade?
- Yeah. Just helping out my little sister.

29:56.753 --> 29:58.983
- Like the uniform?

29:59.089 --> 30:00.681
Well, the last time I saw you in pajamas...

30:00.791 --> 30:02.725
we were playing sheep
in the Christmas pageant.

30:02.826 --> 30:05.590
But, yeah, it's a good look for you.

30:05.695 --> 30:09.324
Huh. Right. Yeah. Baa! Baa!

30:12.536 --> 30:15.528
But I think you spilled something
on your shirt there.

30:15.639 --> 30:18.836
- Oh.
- Gotcha.

30:23.146 --> 30:26.843
Hello!
Delicious lemonade, anyone?

30:26.950 --> 30:28.941
I- Yeah, I'll have one.

30:29.052 --> 30:30.519
- You will?
- Yeah.

30:30.620 --> 30:33.783
Well, that'll be one dollar, please.
Exact change preferred.

30:33.890 --> 30:36.154
Oh, Ramona, Henry doesn't have to pay.

30:36.259 --> 30:39.057
- Beezus, it's for the house.
- Uh, she meant "on the house."

30:39.162 --> 30:40.925
No charge. Here.

30:41.031 --> 30:43.056
- But, Beezus-
- Thank you.

30:43.166 --> 30:45.100
- Beezus!
- Shh.

30:45.202 --> 30:47.363
- Beezus!

30:47.471 --> 30:49.769
- I said, shh.
- But, Beezus-

30:50.540 --> 30:52.633
That won't taste-

30:52.742 --> 30:54.073
good.

30:55.078 --> 30:56.545
Oh!

31:01.251 --> 31:02.775
She's right.

31:02.886 --> 31:04.945
No charge for that.

31:05.055 --> 31:08.149
I wanna die! Just let me die!

31:08.258 --> 31:10.123
I hate my life!

31:10.227 --> 31:13.219
- Beezus?
- No. Go away.

31:13.330 --> 31:15.958
Get out. Get out.

31:16.066 --> 31:19.627
But... what did I do that was so bad?

31:19.736 --> 31:22.136
You embarrassed me in front of Henry.

31:22.239 --> 31:25.504
If I didn't know better, I'd swear you were
actually trying to ruin my life.

31:25.609 --> 31:29.272
You run around like a nutball.
You don't care what anybody thinks.

31:29.379 --> 31:32.576
And you even stuck me
with my stupid nickname.

31:32.682 --> 31:34.673
But I was just a baby then...

31:34.784 --> 31:36.775
and I meant to call you Beatrice.

31:36.887 --> 31:39.913
It just came out... wrong.

31:40.023 --> 31:42.548
Yeah, tell me about it.

31:42.659 --> 31:45.958
How can I be normal with a name like Beezus?

31:47.631 --> 31:49.792
Who could ever love a girl named Beezus?

31:51.434 --> 31:52.924
Jesus?

31:53.837 --> 31:55.134
Get out!

32:01.378 --> 32:04.472
Mrs. Pitt, would you care
for a car wash today?

32:04.581 --> 32:06.446
My car is in the shop today, dearie.

32:06.550 --> 32:08.643
- Wash your car?
- Just washed it myself.

32:08.752 --> 32:11.152
Please let me wash your car, please!

32:13.590 --> 32:15.615
Are you the pizza man?

32:15.725 --> 32:16.953
No.

32:27.504 --> 32:28.869
Hey, babe.

32:29.973 --> 32:30.962
Hey.

32:31.074 --> 32:32.974
How's business?

32:33.076 --> 32:35.840
- I'm considering retirement.

32:35.946 --> 32:40.406
Ramona's not a quitter.

32:41.351 --> 32:43.376
Mwah!

32:43.486 --> 32:47.752
- Is he still out there?

32:47.857 --> 32:51.816
Doesn't he have anything better to do than
tinker with his precious Jeep?

32:51.928 --> 32:53.657
Oh, look at him.

32:53.763 --> 32:58.097
He thinks he can flash
those hazel eyes and that smug little smile...

32:58.201 --> 33:00.601
and just reel me back in again.

33:00.704 --> 33:03.002
- Reel you back in?
- Yeah.

33:03.106 --> 33:05.666
- Like a sea bass.
- Ew.

33:05.775 --> 33:09.370
- I know. Exactly.

33:09.479 --> 33:11.606
Here's what we do.

33:11.715 --> 33:13.615
We head straight to the house...

33:13.717 --> 33:15.878
looking confident and radiant...

33:15.986 --> 33:19.444
so Hobart gets a good look at everything
he missed out on, okay?

33:19.556 --> 33:21.786
- Okay.
- I'm so glad I wore my good jeans.

33:21.891 --> 33:24.223
- Ready to strut?
- I think so.

33:24.327 --> 33:27.387
- Hmm.
- But what if he tries to talk to us?

33:27.497 --> 33:29.829
- We ignore him.
- Got it.

33:29.933 --> 33:32.629
- Strut and ignore.
- Mm-hmm.

33:35.772 --> 33:37.672
Mm-mmm!

33:37.774 --> 33:39.401
Keep up the good work.

33:39.509 --> 33:41.477
- Mm-mmm-mmm.
- Mm-mmm.

33:41.578 --> 33:44.604
- Excuse me.
- Oh!

33:48.418 --> 33:50.079
Good, Bea. Real smooth.

33:50.186 --> 33:52.154
How are you doing there, Beatrice?

33:53.690 --> 33:56.124
- You got a little-
- No.

33:56.226 --> 33:59.127
You gotta watch out for that cross traffic,
ladies. What's the rush?

33:59.229 --> 34:01.254
We're ignoring you.

34:01.364 --> 34:03.594
Now, why would you wanna do that?

34:03.700 --> 34:07.261
So nobody gets reeled in like a sea bass.

34:07.370 --> 34:09.998
- Oh! Like the fish?
- Mm-hmm.

34:10.106 --> 34:13.768
Huh. Well, we'll make sure
that doesn't happen.

34:13.877 --> 34:17.313
But it would be nice to find some time
to catch up with your Aunt Bea.

34:18.915 --> 34:21.315
I think we just did. Excuse us.

34:24.521 --> 34:26.648
Keep struttin', Aunt Bea. You're doing good.

34:26.755 --> 34:28.587
Hey, Ramona!

34:28.692 --> 34:31.353
That Jeep of mine could sure use a wash,
don't you think?

34:31.460 --> 34:34.692
The poor thing's been sitting in the garage
for 15 years now, Bea?

34:34.797 --> 34:36.425
How much to hose her off?

34:40.370 --> 34:41.837
Fifty dollars.

34:41.938 --> 34:44.498
- Fifty d- No. No, no, no.
- Mm-hmm.

34:44.607 --> 34:47.167
No, I would never take advantage
of you like that, Ramona.

34:47.277 --> 34:49.438
That Jeep is my pride and joy.

34:49.545 --> 34:53.107
For you to wash it,
and a "delishus" custom hand-wash at that...

34:53.216 --> 34:55.116
I'm gonna have to insist on, uh-

34:55.217 --> 34:58.654
I don't know- an even... hundred bucks?

34:58.755 --> 35:00.313
Really?

35:03.126 --> 35:05.526
Yeah. Really. Not a penny less.

35:06.629 --> 35:08.460
One hundred dollars?

35:08.565 --> 35:10.294
- Yeah.
- Whoo!

35:10.400 --> 35:12.630
Oh, just, uh, one little condition.

35:12.736 --> 35:14.670
Bea gets to chat with me.

35:14.771 --> 35:17.171
Yeah, we can sit inside,
like the old car washes.

35:17.273 --> 35:19.468
- What do you say, Bea?

35:19.576 --> 35:21.510
Like I said, it'd be nice to catch up.

35:21.611 --> 35:23.010
Please, please, please.

35:26.883 --> 35:29.010
How fast can you wash his car?

35:33.623 --> 35:36.091
- Milady.
- Huh. I'm regretting this already.

35:38.094 --> 35:39.994
- Oh.

35:48.204 --> 35:50.104
It's like time stood still in here.

35:50.206 --> 35:52.697
- I'd swear I was back in high school.
- Mm-hmm.

35:52.809 --> 35:55.209
- The good old days.

35:56.279 --> 35:58.509
I wouldn't mind going back for a while.

35:58.615 --> 36:02.415
Maybe I could, you know,
figure out where I messed up.

36:02.519 --> 36:04.919
Oh, ancient history. I've moved on.

36:05.021 --> 36:07.353
Yeah, I'll say.

36:11.227 --> 36:13.218
Back off, Romeo.

36:13.329 --> 36:15.422
- I think she likes me.

36:15.532 --> 36:17.523
Don't bet on it.

36:17.634 --> 36:19.067
Stay cool, Aunt Bea.

36:19.169 --> 36:23.105
So I'll be heading off to Alaska
in a few weeks.

36:23.206 --> 36:26.471
After I get this thing up and running,
I am back on the road...

36:26.576 --> 36:29.909
and out of your hair for the next few years.

36:30.013 --> 36:32.777
Well, my hair thanks you.

36:32.882 --> 36:34.782
But it was inspired of you...

36:34.884 --> 36:38.047
bribing my niece just to talk to me,
Mr. Moneybags.

36:38.154 --> 36:39.553
Well, a hundred bucks is a bargain.

36:39.656 --> 36:43.114
Between you and me,
I was willing to go much higher.

36:43.226 --> 36:46.195
Oh, really?
Times have changed.

36:47.630 --> 36:50.224
This from the guy who bought me a ring
for my sweet 16...

36:50.333 --> 36:52.301
straight from a gum ball machine.

36:52.402 --> 36:55.963
- Oh, yeah. That's right.
- I even had to lend you the quarter.

36:58.908 --> 37:01.809
Let's face it.
I wanted that ring to be real.

37:01.911 --> 37:03.811
You always knew it was disposable.

37:03.913 --> 37:05.642
Just you and me in a nutshell.

37:05.748 --> 37:07.340
Yeah.

37:07.450 --> 37:09.418
Coming through. Ooh!

37:12.088 --> 37:13.988
What do we have here?

37:14.090 --> 37:15.921
Oh, no!

37:16.025 --> 37:18.050
- "You and Me Forever Mix"?
- Oh, Hobart!

37:18.161 --> 37:20.925
Could these be the romantic stylings
of the young Beatrice?

37:21.030 --> 37:23.089
Oh, don't play it.
Oh, Hobart, that's embarrassing.

37:23.199 --> 37:25.099
- Please don't play it.
- Of course I'm gonna play it.

37:25.201 --> 37:28.295
- This is so embarrassing.

37:28.404 --> 37:30.031
Uh-uh.

37:30.139 --> 37:31.970
Oh!

37:57.133 --> 37:58.998
Howie, help!

37:59.102 --> 38:01.730
She's getting reeled in. Whoo!

38:01.838 --> 38:03.362
- Howie!
- Ramona!

38:03.473 --> 38:05.236
She's getting reeled in!

38:08.278 --> 38:09.711
Oh, oh, oh!

38:09.812 --> 38:11.973
Hobart, do something!

38:23.793 --> 38:26.728
- I'm afraid to look.

38:36.706 --> 38:40.574
No, no, no.
The surface was wet. He tried hosing it off.

38:40.677 --> 38:44.738
How do we get it off
without damaging the paint job underneath?

38:44.847 --> 38:46.747
And if we bring it in, how much?

38:46.849 --> 38:48.612
Ballpark?

38:48.718 --> 38:50.549
What is that, hundreds?

38:50.653 --> 38:53.781
- Thousands?
- No. No. Try this guy.

38:53.890 --> 38:56.791
Well, this is gonna cost us a fortune.

38:56.893 --> 38:58.861
Hello. I'd- Yes, I'll hold.

39:00.697 --> 39:03.393
I- I'm so sorry.

39:04.867 --> 39:06.300
It's all my fault.

39:10.139 --> 39:12.733
- You're sorry?
- Mm-hmm.

39:12.842 --> 39:17.302
Uh, I'm sorry, because now
that I'm looking at it from a distance...

39:17.413 --> 39:19.881
I realize that I should be thanking you.

39:19.983 --> 39:23.384
I mean, look at it. It's- It's camouflaged.

39:23.486 --> 39:27.388
And from what I hear,
the icy Alaskan terrain looks-

39:27.490 --> 39:29.390
looks just like that.

39:29.492 --> 39:31.790
So I can just sneak right
up on those polar bears.

39:31.894 --> 39:34.385
I don't even have to get out of my Jeep.

39:35.798 --> 39:39.666
Well, I'm- I'm glad you like it?

39:39.769 --> 39:41.669
- I love it.
- Hey, Hobart, are you crazy?

39:41.771 --> 39:43.966
- You're not gonna leave it like that.
- No, no, no. No, no.

39:44.073 --> 39:47.907
I paid for something "delishus,"
and look what I got- an Easter egg.

39:49.345 --> 39:51.472
What do you think, Bea?

39:51.581 --> 39:53.515
That a good look for me?

39:55.018 --> 39:56.576
Hmm.

39:58.688 --> 40:00.588
Sure.

40:00.690 --> 40:03.853
It might even bring out your sensitive side.

40:09.098 --> 40:11.066
Next time we clean the neighbor's garage...

40:11.167 --> 40:13.931
it's coming out of your allowance,
not mine, Picasso.

40:14.037 --> 40:16.005
For your records, my dear.

40:18.374 --> 40:20.535
Now I have less money than I started with...

40:20.643 --> 40:22.133
and I started with zero.

40:22.245 --> 40:24.805
How about you focus
on things around the house instead?

40:24.914 --> 40:28.714
Like being a good helper,
getting along with your sisters.

40:28.818 --> 40:30.843
I can feed Roberta, Mommy.

40:30.953 --> 40:32.853
Don't worry about a thing. I'll do it.

40:32.955 --> 40:35.287
Here's the peas and a spoon.
Work some magic.

40:35.391 --> 40:37.291
That's my girl.

40:39.696 --> 40:41.789
Ooh, look!

40:41.898 --> 40:46.335
Here comes the... intergalactic space lava.

40:46.436 --> 40:49.837
Ramona, she's an infant. She doesn't know
what intergalactic space lava is.

40:49.939 --> 40:52.407
- I don't even know what that is.
- Oh, you butt out, Beez-

40:54.077 --> 40:59.845
Uh, I mean, thank you for your feedback.

40:59.949 --> 41:01.849
I love feedback.

41:04.120 --> 41:05.587
Love it.

41:06.856 --> 41:09.256
- Any progress today?

41:09.358 --> 41:14.762
Yeah. I, um- I got a couple of leads, but...

41:14.864 --> 41:17.833
I don't know
if I'm executive material anymore.

41:18.935 --> 41:20.835
Could be time to try something else.

41:20.937 --> 41:24.668
- Like what?
- Fireman! Fireman, fireman.

41:25.675 --> 41:26.699
Fireman.

41:28.377 --> 41:30.641
I don't know.

41:30.747 --> 41:32.647
You know, something creative.

41:32.749 --> 41:35.013
Uh- I used to be a creative guy.

41:35.118 --> 41:37.018
Yeah, well...

41:37.120 --> 41:41.079
if you find a job that pays you
to be creative and have fun...

41:41.190 --> 41:43.124
then maybe you can give them my resume too.

41:48.631 --> 41:51.156
Guess what! It's picture day tomorrow.

41:51.267 --> 41:52.734
Oh! That's good.

41:52.835 --> 41:54.803
Seeing your picture always cheers me up.

41:54.904 --> 41:57.202
Me too.

41:57.306 --> 42:00.673
And I'll make sure
it's the best picture ever, ever.

42:00.777 --> 42:02.904
It'll be... dazzling.

42:03.012 --> 42:04.775
We expect nothing less.

42:05.681 --> 42:07.376
Say "peas. "

42:07.483 --> 42:09.075
"Peas, please."

42:09.185 --> 42:12.052
Mom, I got Roberta to eat her peas.

42:12.155 --> 42:13.986
Yummy peas.

42:17.026 --> 42:20.587
- Hmm, hmm.

42:21.864 --> 42:23.729
That is disgus-

42:24.834 --> 42:26.734
I mean...

42:26.836 --> 42:29.327
what a darling little sister.

42:29.438 --> 42:31.429
I wish there were 10 of you.

42:44.253 --> 42:46.016
"Royal Peanut Butter.

42:46.122 --> 42:49.421
There's a bit of magic in every jar."

42:49.525 --> 42:52.426
Is that one of your favorites?
That's the racket we gotta get you into.

42:52.528 --> 42:54.996
'Cause those TV kids make millions.

42:55.097 --> 42:57.793
Beezus, do you think
I could be in a commercial like that?

42:57.900 --> 43:00.164
- Sure. You'd make a great frog.

43:00.269 --> 43:03.102
- Hey.
- Hold still. I'm almost done.

43:03.206 --> 43:05.504
It's picture perfect, right?

43:05.608 --> 43:07.542
Let's be realistic, Ramona.

43:07.643 --> 43:09.634
This is a curling iron, not a magic wand.

43:09.745 --> 43:13.704
But all things considered,
I'd say you've never looked better.

43:16.118 --> 43:18.348
I love it!

43:18.454 --> 43:20.354
Thanks, Beezus.

43:21.624 --> 43:22.591
Ribbit!

43:25.261 --> 43:28.389
How your mom kept things
running so smooth beats me.

43:28.497 --> 43:30.522
Dad, since the room's almost done...

43:30.633 --> 43:32.624
have you decided
who's gonna get it for sure?

43:33.736 --> 43:36.364
Why? You know somebody who's interested?

43:36.472 --> 43:38.167
Mm-hmm.

43:38.274 --> 43:42.506
Okay, let me think about it,
'cause I like your persistence.

43:42.612 --> 43:44.842
Yes. The answer's still no.

43:44.947 --> 43:45.879
Okay.

43:53.456 --> 43:56.152
Wow. You are definitely dazzling, Pickle.

43:56.259 --> 43:59.057
- all right, go smile big and make us proud.
- Bye, Dad.

43:59.161 --> 44:02.187
- Bye, Beezus. Bye, Roberta.

44:02.298 --> 44:04.323
So I'm gonna take this...

44:04.433 --> 44:07.596
and stick it right in the mouth
to make it look like fire.

44:10.339 --> 44:13.797
Whoa. You look fancy, Susan.

44:13.910 --> 44:16.674
My mother helped me pick out
the perfect ensemble.

44:16.779 --> 44:19.714
She's in real estate, so she knows
a little something about presentation.

44:19.815 --> 44:22.613
She could help you too, Ramona,
if you want a consultation.

44:22.718 --> 44:25.949
- My mom lets me pick out my own clothes.
- We can tell.

44:30.459 --> 44:32.427
Excuse me. What are you doing?

44:32.528 --> 44:35.793
I'm loading my grape-a-pult. Watch and learn.

44:37.133 --> 44:39.431
And what was the purpose of that?

44:39.535 --> 44:41.935
The question is, can anybody top it?

44:43.472 --> 44:46.635
Have you ever seen the proper way
to crack a hard-boiled egg?

44:46.742 --> 44:49.302
Take notes if you want to, Susan.

45:03.893 --> 45:06.794
- Say cheese.

45:06.896 --> 45:08.386
Next.

45:08.497 --> 45:10.590
- Say "cheese."
- Better just smile then, nice and big.

45:10.700 --> 45:11.997
Next.

45:13.436 --> 45:15.495
- Say "cheese."
- Egg in her hair?

45:15.604 --> 45:17.504
- That's a new one.

45:17.606 --> 45:19.574
- Next.

45:20.676 --> 45:23.110
- Say "cheese."
- Cheese.

45:24.246 --> 45:26.771
How come you always tell us to say "cheese"?

45:26.882 --> 45:30.374
- Don't you get tired of "cheese"?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

45:30.486 --> 45:32.613
- Next.

45:35.725 --> 45:39.126
- Say... "peas."
- Ew!

45:41.430 --> 45:43.489
Just when you thought
it was safe to open the mail.

45:47.970 --> 45:50.165
I'm sorry about that raw egg, kiddo.

45:50.272 --> 45:51.830
I guess I really messed that one up.

45:51.941 --> 45:54.842
- I look like a troll.
- No, you don't.

45:54.944 --> 45:56.844
Yeah, she totally does.

45:56.946 --> 45:59.176
Hey. Maybe it's not "terrifical. "

45:59.281 --> 46:02.512
But this is definitely a keeper.
This is going in my wallet.

46:05.521 --> 46:07.819
Come on. You wanna help me fold?

46:07.923 --> 46:11.723
I'd just mess it up, Dad.
Admit it. I'm a nuisance.

46:11.827 --> 46:16.196
- You are not a nuisance.
- Mrs. Meacham says I'm a nuisance.

46:16.298 --> 46:19.131
- And she's a professional.
- You know what I think?

46:19.235 --> 46:22.671
You just have so much energy,
sometimes it gets away from you.

46:22.772 --> 46:24.706
I'm not saying that energy's bad.

46:24.807 --> 46:26.832
It's just you gotta learn how to control it.

46:26.942 --> 46:29.502
I mean, come on, let's be honest here.

46:29.612 --> 46:32.581
Two months ago, you couldn't trust me
with the laundry, and now?

46:32.681 --> 46:34.740
- Doesn't that look good?
- Yeah.

46:34.850 --> 46:38.013
Yeah. all right.
You just gotta try, kiddo.

46:38.120 --> 46:40.520
We're both gonna turn this around.

46:40.623 --> 46:42.523
Just keep trying, kiddo.

46:42.625 --> 46:44.593
- Okay.
- That's my girl!

47:07.349 --> 47:11.911
- Hey. Whoa! Let me help you there.

47:14.857 --> 47:16.722
- Morning doughnut.

47:23.499 --> 47:25.023
- Whoa!
- Oh!

47:25.134 --> 47:27.193
- Who would like to put this up?

47:27.303 --> 47:30.898
- And what does that spell?
- Delicious.

47:31.006 --> 47:34.772
Bye!
I'll miss you guys!

47:37.546 --> 47:40.106
- Whoo!

47:40.216 --> 47:42.946
Sweetie, you should come
and celebrate with us.

47:43.052 --> 47:45.714
- What am I celebrating?
- Well, you've been working so hard...

47:45.821 --> 47:49.587
we thought you'd be kind of excited
about getting your own room.

47:55.998 --> 47:59.798
T-minus three, two, one, blastoff!

48:20.422 --> 48:22.356
- Ramona!

48:22.458 --> 48:25.757
Stop making so much noise.

48:25.861 --> 48:27.852
Sorry. I'm just enjoying my new room.

48:27.963 --> 48:30.363
Stop gloating. It's not polite.

48:30.466 --> 48:33.299
I'm not gloating. I'm bouncing.

48:33.402 --> 48:36.496
Well, if you want your junk,
you better go grab it now.

48:36.605 --> 48:38.869
Anything left over goes to Goodwill.

48:39.909 --> 48:42.469
Remember me, Ramona? Baa!

48:42.578 --> 48:44.375
- Stop!
- Help me!

48:44.480 --> 48:46.311
Give it back.

48:46.415 --> 48:48.679
- Baa!
- Give it back.

48:48.784 --> 48:51.150
- So, what do you think?

48:54.223 --> 48:55.781
Uh. That's far enough.

48:55.891 --> 48:58.689
This is a no-pest zone.

49:01.197 --> 49:04.792
Well, who needs you...
or your dumb teenager room?

49:04.900 --> 49:09.360
- I like it by myself.
- Uh-huh. Sure you do.

49:09.471 --> 49:12.963
When the lights go out,
and then you start thinking...

49:13.075 --> 49:17.205
about all the noises and the monsters...

49:17.313 --> 49:21.113
and then you realize
you didn't check under your bed...

49:21.217 --> 49:22.878
not carefully...

49:22.985 --> 49:24.976
don't come knocking on my door.

49:26.522 --> 49:29.013
If you make it that far.

49:41.971 --> 49:45.600
- Slithering beast...

49:45.708 --> 49:50.611
that feeds on pests with bad report cards.

50:02.091 --> 50:03.683
Picky Picky?

50:16.205 --> 50:18.264
Ramona, come on. Let's go. We're late.

50:18.374 --> 50:22.037
Dad, what's another word for "sick"?

50:22.144 --> 50:24.977
Um, queasy? Nauseous?

50:25.080 --> 50:27.139
Like really, really sick?

50:27.249 --> 50:29.046
Oh. Bilious.

50:29.151 --> 50:31.881
Dad, I feel bilious.

50:31.987 --> 50:35.855
I don't think school's a good call right now.

50:38.160 --> 50:42.358
Oh. You're in a suit.
Do you have an interview?

50:42.464 --> 50:44.955
Well, yeah,
but I can change it if we have to.

50:45.067 --> 50:48.059
Are you queasy sick or achy sick?

50:49.171 --> 50:53.301
Well, I'm kind of feeling better now.

50:53.409 --> 50:54.933
You sure?

50:55.044 --> 50:58.172
Okay, well, let's go.
We got, like, 60 seconds.

50:58.280 --> 51:00.180
- Fast, like a fireman.

51:00.282 --> 51:02.409
59, 58...

51:02.518 --> 51:04.543
57- Come on.

51:04.653 --> 51:07.747
- 56, 55-

51:07.856 --> 51:09.756
54-

51:12.094 --> 51:14.562
- Bye, Dad!
- Bye!

51:19.735 --> 51:22.203
Hey, Ramona!
You've gotta see this. Come on.

51:22.304 --> 51:25.000
- What?
- Come on. Come on, come on, come on.

51:26.275 --> 51:28.436
Here. Check this out.

51:34.516 --> 51:36.143
- Hobart!
- Yeah?

51:36.251 --> 51:38.776
Mind where you're digging.

51:38.887 --> 51:41.549
We've got sprinkler pipes down there.

51:41.657 --> 51:44.353
Oh, is that what I keep hitting?

51:44.460 --> 51:46.792
Don't worry, Mom. Relax. It's okay.

51:46.895 --> 51:49.295
Oh!

51:49.398 --> 51:51.366
- Good talk.
- What do you think he's doing?

51:51.467 --> 51:54.698
Maybe he's digging
a secret tunnel to Istanbul.

51:54.803 --> 51:58.637
A spy network right through
your very own backyard.

51:58.741 --> 52:03.144
Or maybe this house was built
on an old burial ground...

52:03.245 --> 52:05.713
and I'm unlocking an ancient curse.

52:16.225 --> 52:19.661
Open call?
That means anybody can audition, right?

52:19.762 --> 52:21.662
Mm-hmm.

52:21.764 --> 52:25.996
Ramona, they don't want just anybody.
They want a princess.

52:26.101 --> 52:28.763
- A million dollars.
- Take out your instruments. Good.

52:28.871 --> 52:32.204
all right. Grab a seat, kids.
Let's shake this rust out and start jammin'.

52:32.307 --> 52:35.708
One, two, three, four.

52:37.112 --> 52:39.580
Yeah! Yeah, you guys are tight!

53:08.076 --> 53:10.203
Ramona!

53:10.312 --> 53:12.246
Why did you do that?

53:12.347 --> 53:15.441
I can't help it. They're mesmerizing.

53:15.551 --> 53:19.112
But you've been doing it since kindergarten,
and it's getting old.

53:19.221 --> 53:21.712
Look, I know things must be rough at home...

53:21.824 --> 53:23.951
but don't take it out on my curls.

53:24.059 --> 53:27.290
Okay. Hold on a second, guys. That was good.

53:27.396 --> 53:29.364
That was almost the song.

53:29.465 --> 53:34.129
So, um, guitars, quick rehearsal.
Everybody else, take five.

53:34.236 --> 53:36.500
Ramona!

53:36.605 --> 53:40.166
What was that about? "Rough at home"?

53:40.275 --> 53:44.075
- Well, your dad lost his job, didn't he?
- Maybe.

53:44.179 --> 53:47.171
Look, when people lose their jobs, you know,
they start fighting...

53:47.282 --> 53:50.251
and then they get a divorce
and sell their houses.

53:50.352 --> 53:53.082
It's textbook.
Look at the bright side, Ramona.

53:53.188 --> 53:56.419
I mean, after my dad got laid off,
my mom sold her house...

53:56.525 --> 53:58.789
got a real estate license, so there's a plus.

53:58.894 --> 54:02.125
And then my dad got a new car
and moved to Tacoma.

54:02.231 --> 54:03.823
Tacoma?

54:05.968 --> 54:08.334
Susan, I'm so sorry.

54:08.437 --> 54:12.168
Well, now on my birthdays,
they both give me checks, so it works out.

54:14.877 --> 54:17.607
Okay.

54:21.116 --> 54:23.846
Hey, Ramona?
Would you mind taking your seat again?

54:23.952 --> 54:26.614
What are you doing by the window there?

54:26.722 --> 54:28.383
I was-

54:28.490 --> 54:31.823
I was wondering, where is Tacoma?

54:44.473 --> 54:47.704
- Repulsive.
- Oh, boy.

54:48.877 --> 54:52.904
- all right. You can all go to lunch now.
- Ew!

54:53.015 --> 54:56.644
Are you-
Ramona, why are you wearing pajamas?

54:58.387 --> 55:02.687
'Cause firemen do it that way?

55:02.791 --> 55:04.258
I see.

55:04.359 --> 55:08.455
Well, pajamas under your clothes
and eggs in your hair.

55:08.564 --> 55:11.362
You and your father
are breaking new ground together.

55:13.168 --> 55:15.295
You get comfortable in there.

55:21.643 --> 55:23.577
Come on.

55:23.679 --> 55:25.704
- Oh!

55:25.814 --> 55:28.749
Come on!

55:28.850 --> 55:30.681
You're kidding me.

55:30.786 --> 55:34.620
Try this one.
Okay. No, no. That's no good.

55:34.723 --> 55:36.691
I think this one's gonna be good.

55:45.567 --> 55:47.535
How'd the interview go today, Daddy?

55:47.636 --> 55:51.231
Well, I had to cancel the interview
when the nurse called.

55:53.141 --> 55:55.041
But there's other jobs out there.

55:56.712 --> 56:00.011
Hey, we're not gonna let
one bad day get us down.

56:02.084 --> 56:06.817
Let's do somethin'... really special.

56:06.922 --> 56:10.153
Just me and you.
What would you like to do? Think big.

56:12.327 --> 56:17.162
Well, you know that big bridge we took
when we went to Washington State?

56:17.265 --> 56:20.291
- Yeah.
- I've always wanted to stop in the middle...

56:20.402 --> 56:22.962
and have one foot in Oregon
and one in Washington.

56:23.071 --> 56:26.734
- Hmm?
- That way my Legs have dual citizenship.

56:26.842 --> 56:29.936
I like it.

56:30.045 --> 56:32.138
That's interesting. Interesting notion.

56:32.247 --> 56:34.807
Not practical because the car's kaput...

56:34.916 --> 56:36.816
but you're on the right track.

56:36.918 --> 56:39.546
I mean, it's bold, it's daring,
it's fairly inexpensive.

56:39.655 --> 56:41.646
Come on. Give me- What else?

56:44.126 --> 56:46.026
We could draw it.

56:47.729 --> 56:51.392
Oh! I've got an idea.

56:54.603 --> 56:59.097
Let's me and you draw
the longest picture in the world.

56:59.207 --> 57:02.040
What do you think?

57:11.386 --> 57:13.354
Okay.

57:13.455 --> 57:17.357
I'm gonna draw our house,
and then I'm gonna draw Howie's house...

57:17.459 --> 57:20.656
and school and Mount Hood...

57:20.762 --> 57:24.220
and everything else as far as I can see.

57:29.738 --> 57:31.638
- Daddy?
- Hmm?

57:33.475 --> 57:36.467
I think you draw better
than anybody in the whole world.

57:37.512 --> 57:41.312
Oh. Well, thank you, Pickle.

57:41.416 --> 57:44.146
You know, I studied art
back in the day, as they say.

57:44.252 --> 57:46.152
What happened?

57:47.189 --> 57:49.089
Did you get a bad report card?

57:49.191 --> 57:51.785
No.

57:51.893 --> 57:54.384
Beezus came along.

57:54.496 --> 57:56.930
Then I took the best job I could,
and before you know it...

57:57.032 --> 57:58.932
I was a vice president.

57:59.034 --> 58:02.231
- Then I came along?
- Yep. That's right.

58:02.337 --> 58:04.237
And then Roberta.

58:06.575 --> 58:09.942
But I wouldn't change a thing.
You girls make my life very colorful.

58:30.232 --> 58:32.166
- Hi. Hey, Beezus.
- Hey.

58:32.267 --> 58:35.202
- Wanna walk home?
- Sure.

58:35.303 --> 58:36.861
Cool.

58:37.906 --> 58:39.806
Oh, man.

58:39.908 --> 58:43.207
When we were kids, I thought your dad was,
like, the king of Klickitat Street.

58:43.311 --> 58:46.405
Do you remember that gorilla hunt
in my backyard...

58:46.515 --> 58:49.916
when he made us set up the tents
and wait there all night...

58:50.018 --> 58:52.418
with bananas and butterfly nets?

58:52.521 --> 58:55.354
You ended up with mashed bananas
in your hair.

58:55.457 --> 58:57.789
I had poison ivy all over me.

58:57.893 --> 58:59.793
But it was also-

58:59.895 --> 59:02.693
- The best time we had that whole summer.
- Hands down.

59:06.735 --> 59:09.431
Yeah, well, he's not as funny these days.

59:09.538 --> 59:12.063
Why? What's going on?

59:12.174 --> 59:15.439
He lost his job a few weeks ago...

59:15.544 --> 59:19.913
and he acts like he's not worried,
for our sake, but I can tell he is.

59:20.015 --> 59:22.040
And he should be.

59:22.150 --> 59:25.017
What if he doesn't get something
that he likes?

59:26.688 --> 59:29.156
What if he has to settle
for something that he hates...

59:29.257 --> 59:31.885
because of... us?

59:33.295 --> 59:35.456
Beezus, that's a big deal.

59:35.564 --> 59:38.362
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I don't know.

59:40.936 --> 59:46.704
I don't know. Sometimes...
things feel different between us.

59:46.808 --> 59:50.835
Like it's not as easy to talk to you
as it used to be, you know?

59:52.681 --> 59:55.616
Yeah. Yeah, I guess. A little.

59:55.717 --> 59:58.481
- It's not that I don't want to talk to you-
- No, no. I get you.

59:58.587 --> 01:00:00.885
- It's just very different.
- Different.

01:00:00.989 --> 01:00:02.889
Exactly.

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:06.550
Oh, gosh.

01:00:06.661 --> 01:00:08.652
Um- Yeah.

01:00:08.763 --> 01:00:10.424
Thank you.

01:00:10.532 --> 01:00:13.330
- You should probably button that.
- Oh.

01:00:13.435 --> 01:00:17.531
Yeah. It's good to know
some things never change.

01:00:22.143 --> 01:00:25.442
- Since my last report had some holes in it-

01:00:25.547 --> 01:00:28.015
Mrs. Meacham gave me a do-over.

01:00:28.116 --> 01:00:30.710
So, may I present to you...

01:00:30.819 --> 01:00:33.447
the longest picture in the world.

01:00:46.902 --> 01:00:49.496
- Wow.

01:00:52.574 --> 01:00:55.737
- Ooh.

01:00:55.844 --> 01:01:00.804
Excuse me, but what about the paintings
in those big churches in Europe?

01:01:00.916 --> 01:01:03.612
I mean, aren't they longer?

01:01:03.718 --> 01:01:06.243
Yeah, but that's Europe.

01:01:06.354 --> 01:01:08.948
I mean, I'm talkin' about the whole world.

01:01:09.057 --> 01:01:12.185
Susan, you may save your comments for later.

01:01:12.294 --> 01:01:14.194
- Ramona, go ahead.

01:01:18.967 --> 01:01:20.992
My dad made this with me.

01:01:21.102 --> 01:01:24.071
He could have been an artist
when he was younger...

01:01:24.172 --> 01:01:26.140
but he decided to be my dad.

01:01:26.241 --> 01:01:30.473
And he's teaching me how to draw, too,
which means he's patient.

01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:34.774
- P-A-T-I-E-N-T?
- Mm-hmm.

01:01:34.883 --> 01:01:38.250
But you really need to see it close up,
so come and enjoy the view.

01:01:38.353 --> 01:01:42.949
# Dream a little dream with me
Singin' la-la-la, la-la-la #

01:01:43.058 --> 01:01:46.425
Who can see themselves in here?

01:01:46.528 --> 01:01:50.555
# Maybe we can find
the edge of the world#

01:01:50.665 --> 01:01:54.761
# Oh, maybe we can find
the edge of the world ##

01:01:55.870 --> 01:01:59.499
Uh, "Looking for a princess in Portland"?

01:02:00.942 --> 01:02:03.172
Branding. They'll eat it up.

01:02:03.278 --> 01:02:05.178
Yeah?

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.748
Well, wait till they see this.

01:02:10.352 --> 01:02:13.583
Every princess needs a little sparkle.

01:02:13.688 --> 01:02:15.656
Just mix this up.

01:02:17.258 --> 01:02:20.125
We have three little girls.
We have to be realistic.

01:02:20.228 --> 01:02:24.562
- I can't wait another 10 years of my life.
- It's not settling!

01:02:26.434 --> 01:02:28.925
But what about the kids?
They've got school, we got the mortgage.

01:02:29.037 --> 01:02:32.097
- Unbelievable.

01:02:32.207 --> 01:02:34.368
- Wait!

01:02:34.476 --> 01:02:37.639
- Oh!

01:02:37.746 --> 01:02:40.044
Okay there, Sticky Picky.

01:02:40.148 --> 01:02:43.481
I know you're old and creaky, too,
but this is my bed tonight. Come on.

01:02:43.585 --> 01:02:45.883
- Okay? Come on. Come on.

01:02:45.987 --> 01:02:47.682
Good man.

01:02:47.789 --> 01:02:50.257
- Dad, it's Picky Picky.
- Hey.

01:02:53.495 --> 01:02:57.625
Dad, are you and Mom getting a divorce?

01:02:57.732 --> 01:02:59.632
No.

01:02:59.734 --> 01:03:02.726
This is like a time-out for the night.

01:03:02.837 --> 01:03:05.965
Come on.
We'll both be happily married in the morning.

01:03:06.074 --> 01:03:08.042
- Mwah! Go to bed.
- Okay.

01:03:11.679 --> 01:03:13.579
Dad, don't worry.

01:03:13.681 --> 01:03:15.706
Things are gonna change for us.

01:03:15.817 --> 01:03:17.717
I have a plan.

01:03:17.819 --> 01:03:19.480
Now I am worried.

01:03:19.587 --> 01:03:22.613
- Look, Mom! It's the ice cream man!

01:03:34.602 --> 01:03:38.766
- Hey. You sure this is what you want?
- Mm-hmm.

01:03:40.008 --> 01:03:42.602
- Thanks for the ride, Mr. Kemp.
- No problem.

01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:45.679
You know, you are allowed
to call me Hobart if you want.

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:49.045
No, thank you, Mr. Kemp.
This is strictly a business relationship.

01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:51.914
- Okay.
- Wow! Good for you.

01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:54.716
- all right.
- At least one of us is showing a little restraint.

01:03:54.823 --> 01:03:56.950
- Ha-ha.

01:03:57.058 --> 01:03:59.253
- Break a leg, superstar.
- Okay.

01:04:00.829 --> 01:04:02.729
Next is Ruby Hirsch.

01:04:02.831 --> 01:04:04.890
Hey, Susan.

01:04:04.999 --> 01:04:07.695
Wow. You look great.

01:04:07.802 --> 01:04:09.702
Hello, Ramona.

01:04:09.804 --> 01:04:14.173
Susan! How could you be a princess
without your tiara?

01:04:14.275 --> 01:04:17.005
- Hi, Mrs. Kushner.
- Hello, Ramona.

01:04:17.112 --> 01:04:19.478
Okay. Let's go. That looks beautiful.

01:04:24.652 --> 01:04:27.416
Excuse me! Aunt Bea, I need a tiara!

01:04:27.522 --> 01:04:30.889
- It takes a real man to be able
to drive around in this.

01:04:30.992 --> 01:04:32.721
Oh, by the way, I talked to my publisher.

01:04:32.894 --> 01:04:34.725
He found me an apartment in Anchorage.

01:04:34.829 --> 01:04:37.093
Very spacious. Got great views.

01:04:38.133 --> 01:04:39.623
Room for two.

01:04:45.206 --> 01:04:46.833
Well.

01:04:48.409 --> 01:04:52.072
Maybe you can find
a nice polar bear to cuddle up with.

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:54.080
Eh, Alaska could be fun, Bea.

01:04:54.182 --> 01:04:56.878
I mean, it is still the last great frontier.
You know that, right?

01:04:56.985 --> 01:04:58.418
Mm-hmm.

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.454
Plus, it's only a two-year commitment.

01:05:00.555 --> 01:05:03.615
Commitment was never your thing.

01:05:03.725 --> 01:05:06.353
Okay. Now, that's just not fair.

01:05:06.461 --> 01:05:08.986
Bea, you've gotta give me a chance here.
Come on.

01:05:09.097 --> 01:05:12.191
I've been traveling the world for over 10
years trying to get you out of my head.

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:14.666
- And you know what?
- What?

01:05:14.769 --> 01:05:16.669
It ain't workin'.

01:05:18.139 --> 01:05:21.108
I didn't come here for this stupid Jeep.
I came here for you.

01:05:24.646 --> 01:05:26.546
Come with me.

01:05:49.637 --> 01:05:52.606
Next is- whoa-

01:05:52.707 --> 01:05:54.436
Ramona Quimby.

01:06:00.515 --> 01:06:04.076
My goodness.
That's quite the tiara you have there.

01:06:05.186 --> 01:06:07.484
I designed it in the parking lot.

01:06:10.692 --> 01:06:13.593
- So tell me, why are you here today?

01:06:13.695 --> 01:06:17.688
'Cause my dad says that commercials
are the racket to be in.

01:06:17.799 --> 01:06:20.029
Hmm. Twirl.

01:06:21.135 --> 01:06:22.102
Twirl.

01:06:35.650 --> 01:06:37.550
Okay. Thank you, Ramona.

01:06:39.654 --> 01:06:41.747
- Don't move.

01:06:42.824 --> 01:06:44.792
A tiara made of burrs?

01:06:44.892 --> 01:06:48.453
It would have worked, Dad,
until I fell into their stupid sandwich.

01:06:50.131 --> 01:06:51.758
- Sandwich?
- Ow!

01:06:51.866 --> 01:06:56.132
- I won't even ask.
- Ow! You're doing it too fast!

01:06:56.237 --> 01:06:58.899
'Cause I'm late, Ramona. Very late.

01:06:59.007 --> 01:07:00.474
Sorry.

01:07:03.378 --> 01:07:06.370
How's it look? Kinda trendy?

01:07:08.716 --> 01:07:11.981
Oh. Yes, well, that's one way of putting it.

01:07:12.086 --> 01:07:14.247
- Listen up, ladies.

01:07:14.355 --> 01:07:16.880
I got a two-hour drive
to get to this interview...

01:07:16.991 --> 01:07:20.859
so I need you to be responsible
till your mom gets home.

01:07:20.962 --> 01:07:23.260
You have her number at the office
if there's a problem...

01:07:23.364 --> 01:07:26.663
but remember, she's under a lot of stress,
so no fighting, okay?

01:07:26.768 --> 01:07:29.293
Beezus, you're in charge. Baby monitor.

01:07:29.404 --> 01:07:31.634
How come she's always in charge?

01:07:31.739 --> 01:07:33.707
Um, have you seen your hair lately?

01:07:33.808 --> 01:07:35.799
- Imagine what you'd do to our house.
- Hey!

01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:38.470
Just try to be good- especially you.

01:07:38.579 --> 01:07:39.807
- Bye!

01:07:41.949 --> 01:07:45.214
"Especially you. "

01:07:57.165 --> 01:08:01.602
Ramona, I don't think making dinner
is gonna distract Mom from your hair.

01:08:02.804 --> 01:08:06.001
- It's worth a shot.

01:08:06.107 --> 01:08:09.907
Quimby residence. Oh, hi, Henry.

01:08:10.011 --> 01:08:12.673
I'm not sure if Beezus is available.

01:08:12.780 --> 01:08:15.772
- Give it to me! Stop! Give it to me!
- She could be in the bathroom.

01:08:15.883 --> 01:08:18.180
- Go away, you jerk!
- Wait. What did you say?

01:08:18.286 --> 01:08:20.185
- No, not you, Henry!
- Ow!

01:08:20.287 --> 01:08:21.653
You put him on speaker, doofus!

01:08:21.756 --> 01:08:25.350
- I'm Beezus! I love Henry!
- Shut up!

01:08:27.495 --> 01:08:29.359
Should I call back later?

01:08:29.464 --> 01:08:31.091
- No! I want you!
- Huh?

01:08:31.198 --> 01:08:34.167
I mean, I wanna talk to you right now,
so now is a good time!

01:08:34.268 --> 01:08:36.532
- Okay.
- Get off!

01:08:39.006 --> 01:08:41.474
My hot dog souffle!

01:08:46.013 --> 01:08:47.912
Stop!

01:08:50.017 --> 01:08:52.109
- Ramona!

01:08:53.854 --> 01:08:55.913
- Ramona, move!

01:08:56.023 --> 01:08:58.651
Stop! Stop that! Drop it!

01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:01.228
- No!
- I said, drop it!

01:09:11.205 --> 01:09:13.799
You will never change, will you?

01:09:13.908 --> 01:09:16.604
For a moment there,
I actually thought that you were maturing...

01:09:16.711 --> 01:09:18.702
but you will always be a little pest!

01:09:22.049 --> 01:09:24.448
- I'll go get her.
- No! Just stop!

01:09:24.551 --> 01:09:26.452
Stop touching everything!

01:09:26.554 --> 01:09:28.613
Everything that you touch you mess up...

01:09:28.723 --> 01:09:30.622
including my love life.

01:09:30.725 --> 01:09:32.955
You have a love life?

01:09:34.194 --> 01:09:36.560
Just feed the cat and leave me alone!

01:09:46.573 --> 01:09:48.564
Uh, hello?

01:09:48.676 --> 01:09:52.042
Okay. I'm gonna hang up now.

01:09:54.582 --> 01:09:56.880
Picky Picky?

01:09:56.984 --> 01:09:59.384
It's dinnertime.

01:09:59.487 --> 01:10:01.785
- Come on.

01:10:01.889 --> 01:10:04.221
Let's talk.

01:10:04.325 --> 01:10:06.623
Wake up.

01:10:06.727 --> 01:10:09.287
Wake up, lazy bum.

01:10:16.971 --> 01:10:19.235
- Beezus!

01:10:24.695 --> 01:10:26.595
- Beezus?

01:10:26.697 --> 01:10:28.927
I thought he was asleep, but he's not.

01:10:32.703 --> 01:10:34.603
What now?

01:10:34.705 --> 01:10:37.071
He's dead.

01:10:37.174 --> 01:10:40.905
Picky Picky's dead.

01:10:42.346 --> 01:10:46.180
Don't worry. Mom will be home soon.
She'll know what to do.

01:10:46.283 --> 01:10:48.774
No. Remember what Dad said?

01:10:50.721 --> 01:10:53.417
We can't make any trouble for Mom now.

01:10:55.592 --> 01:10:57.492
Okay.

01:10:59.329 --> 01:11:02.696
He was a Quimby before we were, Beezus.

01:11:06.136 --> 01:11:08.263
Picky Picky...

01:11:09.473 --> 01:11:11.941
I hope you have nine lives.

01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:15.578
And maybe tomorrow...

01:11:15.679 --> 01:11:18.671
you can wake up as somebody else's cat...

01:11:18.782 --> 01:11:20.249
start a new life.

01:11:22.519 --> 01:11:25.818
I really hope
they feed you melon rind sometimes.

01:11:28.458 --> 01:11:30.426
I know you like that.

01:11:36.233 --> 01:11:38.463
I think it's important...

01:11:38.568 --> 01:11:40.468
that you know...

01:11:40.570 --> 01:11:43.971
Dad was just pretending to forget your name.

01:11:47.144 --> 01:11:48.668
He always knew it.

01:11:50.247 --> 01:11:52.215
He really did love you.

01:12:00.157 --> 01:12:02.387
We'll miss you, Picky Picky.

01:12:14.538 --> 01:12:17.166
It's okay.

01:12:26.249 --> 01:12:29.082
You girls had to handle
all this tonight by yourselves?

01:12:30.187 --> 01:12:31.654
I'm sorry.

01:12:32.823 --> 01:12:35.724
We're okay, Mom.

01:12:35.826 --> 01:12:39.728
How did I get so lucky
to have two brave girls like you?

01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:41.798
Hmm?

01:12:44.568 --> 01:12:46.627
I'm home!

01:12:46.736 --> 01:12:49.364
We have some news.

01:12:49.473 --> 01:12:52.135
So do l. I got the job.

01:12:52.242 --> 01:12:54.107
What?

01:12:54.211 --> 01:12:56.771
Great position.

01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:58.848
Start-up in eastern Oregon.

01:13:00.116 --> 01:13:02.243
How do you girls feel about that?

01:13:02.352 --> 01:13:04.877
Wait. To live there?

01:13:04.988 --> 01:13:06.455
Mm-hmm.

01:13:06.556 --> 01:13:08.615
But what about the house?

01:13:09.993 --> 01:13:12.188
We'll get a new one there.

01:13:13.230 --> 01:13:15.130
What's your news?

01:13:18.768 --> 01:13:20.668
Nothing.

01:13:26.543 --> 01:13:29.011
Ramona?

01:13:30.113 --> 01:13:32.411
Will you sleep in here with me tonight?

01:13:43.293 --> 01:13:45.591
I'm not ready for a new school...

01:13:46.696 --> 01:13:48.425
with all new kids.

01:13:49.499 --> 01:13:51.296
Me neither.

01:13:51.401 --> 01:13:53.369
But you'll do fine.

01:13:54.804 --> 01:13:58.262
You don't always embarrass yourself like I do.

01:13:58.375 --> 01:14:01.469
You're the most prettiest,
perfect girl in high school...

01:14:01.578 --> 01:14:04.274
and everybody loves you.

01:14:04.381 --> 01:14:08.112
Ramona,
those people don't know who I am, really.

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:13.847
There's only one person
in that whole school who really knows me.

01:14:13.957 --> 01:14:16.517
- Henry?
- Yeah.

01:14:18.662 --> 01:14:20.789
And that took 15 years.

01:14:22.832 --> 01:14:26.700
Who else is gonna wanna waste 15 years
getting to know me?

01:14:30.106 --> 01:14:32.165
I would.

01:14:37.314 --> 01:14:38.941
Ramona...

01:14:39.049 --> 01:14:41.517
I know that you think
being different is bad...

01:14:44.187 --> 01:14:46.155
but it's not.

01:14:48.458 --> 01:14:52.019
You don't worry about coloring
inside the lines, you know?

01:14:52.128 --> 01:14:53.686
Huh?

01:14:53.797 --> 01:14:57.130
You're your own person.

01:14:57.233 --> 01:14:59.394
You don't care what other people think.

01:14:59.502 --> 01:15:01.766
It's brave being how you are.

01:15:04.174 --> 01:15:06.074
Oh.

01:15:06.176 --> 01:15:08.007
Well...

01:15:08.111 --> 01:15:11.603
sometimes I color inside the lines.

01:15:11.715 --> 01:15:13.683
It really depends on the picture.

01:15:13.783 --> 01:15:15.751
Yeah.

01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:19.682
All right.
So, how does this look?

01:15:19.789 --> 01:15:22.451
It's perfect. Yeah, it's great.

01:15:24.194 --> 01:15:27.322
Why does it have to be Susan's mom?

01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:30.024
She's supposed to be a very good agent,
sweetheart.

01:15:33.703 --> 01:15:36.763
- That's great. Ta-da!

01:15:39.909 --> 01:15:43.470
Aren't you gonna help us, Ramona?
We only have a few hours to do this.

01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:45.810
I don't wanna help sell the house.

01:15:45.915 --> 01:15:47.815
I wanted to save it.

01:15:47.917 --> 01:15:50.078
Are you gonna fill these holes before you go?

01:15:50.186 --> 01:15:51.744
Howie wants to do it.

01:15:51.855 --> 01:15:54.323
Why don't you get
your boyfrlend Hobart to help?

01:15:54.424 --> 01:15:57.552
- He likes to dig.
- Isn't that the truth?

01:15:57.661 --> 01:16:00.129
Now he wants me to go with him to Alaska.

01:16:00.230 --> 01:16:03.324
Last night, he sent roses.

01:16:03.433 --> 01:16:05.458
Alaska? Did you say yes?

01:16:07.537 --> 01:16:09.664
I mean, I was tempted...

01:16:09.773 --> 01:16:12.241
but if I'm gonna uproot my entire life...

01:16:12.342 --> 01:16:14.902
I need some real sign of commitment.

01:16:15.011 --> 01:16:17.479
- I'm sorry, Bea.
- Oh, no. Don't be.

01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:21.243
We had our fight,
and now he's running away again.

01:16:21.351 --> 01:16:25.811
In the long run,
I saved myself a massive heartache...

01:16:25.922 --> 01:16:29.050
and just replaced it with a... small one.

01:16:34.197 --> 01:16:37.428
Ramona, grab a hose and help out, okay?

01:16:37.534 --> 01:16:41.698
I know life stinks,
but we still have to make the yard look good.

01:16:41.805 --> 01:16:44.603
Everything will be okay, babe.
Onwards and upwards.

01:16:48.311 --> 01:16:50.006
- Oh!

01:16:50.113 --> 01:16:52.308
Oh, I see! Very funny.

01:16:52.415 --> 01:16:56.181
Who did that? Bea? That's just adorable.

01:16:56.286 --> 01:16:59.016
Classy, Bea. Very classy.

01:16:59.122 --> 01:17:02.853
Now I gotta go inside
and change all my clothes.

01:17:02.959 --> 01:17:05.086
Real nice.

01:17:06.730 --> 01:17:08.527
- Bea.

01:17:08.631 --> 01:17:10.496
Ah!

01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:12.966
That's for the roses, sweetheart.
They need water.

01:17:13.069 --> 01:17:17.165
Oh! There it is! Exhibit "A"!

01:17:17.273 --> 01:17:19.400
The class clown hasn't changed at all!

01:17:19.509 --> 01:17:20.908
Oh, really?

01:17:26.015 --> 01:17:28.381
Okay. That's how it is, huh?

01:17:30.487 --> 01:17:32.512
Howie! Willa Jean!

01:17:32.622 --> 01:17:34.556
Mom!

01:17:34.657 --> 01:17:36.522
- Ladies, I need backup!

01:17:38.661 --> 01:17:41.061
- Find a garden hose!
- Okay. Come on.

01:17:46.536 --> 01:17:49.334
I hope you get frostbite in Alaska!

01:17:51.941 --> 01:17:54.239
Be strong. Be strong, Willa Jean.

01:17:55.311 --> 01:17:57.211
Be strong!

01:17:59.682 --> 01:18:02.116
Get' em!

01:18:03.853 --> 01:18:07.254
- Oh!
- Yeah! Now what? Now what?

01:18:08.558 --> 01:18:10.583
Aunt Bea!

01:18:12.896 --> 01:18:14.625
- Go, go, go!
- Hey, wait, wait, wait.

01:18:14.731 --> 01:18:17.131
- Whoo!

01:18:17.233 --> 01:18:19.895
I think we won. I think we won!

01:18:20.003 --> 01:18:22.528
- Give me some! Whoo-hoo!

01:18:22.639 --> 01:18:25.904
Nice job, you guys. You were animals!

01:18:28.411 --> 01:18:29.969
Whoo-hoo!

01:18:30.079 --> 01:18:32.639
Look who's crying now!

01:18:36.686 --> 01:18:41.089
My pipes! I told you, my pipes!

01:18:48.198 --> 01:18:51.167
- What's all the shouting about?
- Landscaping.

01:18:54.537 --> 01:18:56.437
Oh!

01:18:57.707 --> 01:19:00.301
What? Uh-

01:19:00.410 --> 01:19:03.174
Hobart was right!
It's an ancient curse!

01:19:07.951 --> 01:19:09.782
Oh!

01:19:10.887 --> 01:19:12.855
What?

01:19:15.692 --> 01:19:17.956
I knew it was around here somewhere!

01:19:18.061 --> 01:19:20.120
Bea! Bea, come here. Come here.

01:19:20.230 --> 01:19:22.596
Come here, come here, come here, come here.

01:19:24.601 --> 01:19:28.537
Oh, Beatrice,
I buried this baby a long time ago...

01:19:28.638 --> 01:19:31.607
and I figured I'd find it again someday
when I was ready.

01:19:31.708 --> 01:19:33.903
I still wish that I could go back and fix...

01:19:34.010 --> 01:19:37.002
all the stupid things I did
when we were younger.

01:19:39.115 --> 01:19:41.675
I guess this is as close as I can get.

01:19:54.197 --> 01:19:56.165
You kept all this stuff?

01:19:56.266 --> 01:19:57.790
Yeah.

01:20:01.504 --> 01:20:03.472
That's my gum ball ring.

01:20:15.051 --> 01:20:18.418
Bea, I don't want to go anyplace else
without you.

01:20:19.522 --> 01:20:21.490
I love you.

01:20:22.759 --> 01:20:24.659
Will you marry me?

01:20:30.366 --> 01:20:32.334
You will?

01:20:47.383 --> 01:20:49.977
- Whoo!

01:20:52.155 --> 01:20:55.613
- Guts!

01:20:55.725 --> 01:20:57.784
My head is spinning!

01:20:57.894 --> 01:21:00.624
We must be crazy! We'll have to go
to the courthouse and make it official.

01:21:00.730 --> 01:21:02.721
No, we ain't goin' to no stinking courthouse.

01:21:02.832 --> 01:21:04.993
If we're gonna do something crazy,
we're gonna do it with style.

01:21:05.101 --> 01:21:06.625
We're gonna throw a real wedding.

01:21:06.736 --> 01:21:09.102
- Honey, they want you in Alaska in three days.
- That's plenty of time.

01:21:09.205 --> 01:21:11.969
Sure. But what about a church or food...

01:21:12.075 --> 01:21:14.043
or, say, a wedding dress?

01:21:14.143 --> 01:21:16.407
You can use mine.
You always said you liked it.

01:21:16.512 --> 01:21:18.639
- We can just alter it.
- Yeah! See? I like that idea.

01:21:18.748 --> 01:21:21.216
- There you go!
- Hand-me-downs. It never ends, Ramona.

01:21:21.317 --> 01:21:23.945
Yeah. We get the word out, we book a band...

01:21:24.053 --> 01:21:25.543
boom- we got a wedding!

01:21:25.655 --> 01:21:27.816
People can bring their own food,
their own chairs.

01:21:27.924 --> 01:21:32.554
All we need is a little love
and a few bridesmaids.

01:21:32.662 --> 01:21:34.892
Oh! I've always wanted to be a bridesmaid.

01:21:34.998 --> 01:21:37.466
Ah! Well, that was easy. Anybody else?

01:21:37.567 --> 01:21:40.900
- Ramona? Ramona?
- What do you say? Will you do us the honor?

01:21:43.172 --> 01:21:45.436
Ramona?

01:21:45.541 --> 01:21:47.133
Sea bass!

01:21:48.544 --> 01:21:51.741
- See what?
- Oh, it's an inside joke. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:21:51.848 --> 01:21:53.645
You said you wouldn't get reeled in.

01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:55.775
You said I would always have you around!

01:21:55.885 --> 01:21:57.876
Hey, Ramona? Get back here and apologize.

01:21:57.987 --> 01:22:00.547
- Honey, please come talk to me.

01:22:09.365 --> 01:22:12.198
You have room for a piano.

01:22:12.301 --> 01:22:14.360
Also, look at this built-in desk.
It's fabulous.

01:22:36.392 --> 01:22:37.984
Here.

01:22:42.265 --> 01:22:44.358
- Ramona?
- Stuff that's to go around here, right?

01:22:44.467 --> 01:22:46.332
Ramona!

01:22:53.142 --> 01:22:55.269
Help, anybody!

01:22:56.913 --> 01:22:59.473
- Oh, Ramona!
- Whoa, whoa!

01:22:59.582 --> 01:23:02.016
- Got you! I got you! Come on, honey.
- Okay. Hold on.

01:23:02.118 --> 01:23:04.348
- We got you!

01:23:04.454 --> 01:23:07.014
We saw your underpants.

01:23:07.123 --> 01:23:09.250
- Hey, enough.

01:23:09.358 --> 01:23:12.384
Hey, enough.
Stop the teasing. Go outside.

01:23:12.495 --> 01:23:14.690
Happens all the time. Thank you.

01:23:14.797 --> 01:23:17.163
Okay, Ramona, that's it.

01:23:17.266 --> 01:23:19.860
These antics of yours gotta stop right now.

01:23:19.969 --> 01:23:22.335
You're making our lives really difficult.

01:23:23.439 --> 01:23:25.669
I thought I made it colorful, Dad.

01:23:25.775 --> 01:23:29.074
- Not in the middle
of our open house. Come on!

01:23:29.178 --> 01:23:32.579
You said you were gonna be more responsible.
It's time to grow up.

01:23:32.682 --> 01:23:35.412
Dad, can't you see I'm trying?

01:23:35.518 --> 01:23:38.419
- Well, you gotta try harder.
- Dad?

01:23:38.521 --> 01:23:42.753
- Mrs. Meacham's on the phone.
She needs to talk to you.
- Oh, great. What now?

01:23:42.859 --> 01:23:44.793
Sweetie.

01:23:52.535 --> 01:23:55.299
- Ramona, your father was just-
- Mom!

01:23:55.404 --> 01:23:58.931
I'm nine years old.
I think I can tell when I'm not wanted.

01:23:59.041 --> 01:24:01.339
- I just have to run away.

01:24:01.444 --> 01:24:05.141
- Ramona, don't be silly.
You're not gonna run away.
- No, I mean it.

01:24:06.449 --> 01:24:08.440
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

01:24:10.887 --> 01:24:12.787
How long will you be gone?

01:24:14.857 --> 01:24:17.792
I mean, just in case people start asking.

01:24:18.995 --> 01:24:20.462
Forever.

01:24:22.265 --> 01:24:26.258
Well, in that case,
I think you're gonna need a bigger suitcase.

01:24:32.441 --> 01:24:34.739
Okay. Now, I've added your dad's old sweater.

01:24:34.844 --> 01:24:36.812
I don't want you to get cold at night.

01:24:36.913 --> 01:24:41.577
It's a little big on you now,
but you'll eventually grow into it.

01:24:41.684 --> 01:24:44.244
Oh, and do you plan on brushing your teeth?

01:24:45.288 --> 01:24:47.313
That's my girl.

01:24:47.423 --> 01:24:50.221
I packed your toothbrush and your toothpaste.

01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:52.859
Okay?

01:24:52.962 --> 01:24:55.487
Just promise me that
you'll brush your teeth every single night.

01:24:58.734 --> 01:25:00.599
There you go.

01:25:03.773 --> 01:25:05.968
all righty.

01:25:13.583 --> 01:25:15.483
Don't forget to write.

01:26:20.816 --> 01:26:25.583
- Huh?

01:26:38.401 --> 01:26:41.199
- Hmm?

01:27:10.766 --> 01:27:13.894
- Daddy.

01:27:24.447 --> 01:27:25.744
Gettin' on or not?

01:27:27.416 --> 01:27:28.940
Ramona?

01:27:29.051 --> 01:27:31.485
Sweetie? Ramona?

01:27:39.495 --> 01:27:41.395
M-Mom?

01:27:41.497 --> 01:27:42.828
- Ramona?
- Mom!

01:27:44.166 --> 01:27:46.600
Yes. Where are you?

01:27:46.702 --> 01:27:50.160
- Can you hear me? Mom?
- Ramona, sweetie?

01:28:11.193 --> 01:28:13.684
You made my bag heavy on purpose.

01:28:15.731 --> 01:28:18.256
Well, what else was I supposed to do, huh?

01:28:18.367 --> 01:28:20.801
I'd be just lost without my Ramona.

01:28:20.903 --> 01:28:23.633
I'm sorry.

01:28:23.739 --> 01:28:26.299
I just thought you all
would be better off without me.

01:28:26.409 --> 01:28:30.209
You don't think we'd let you get away that
easy, do you? You're a Quimby for life.

01:28:32.581 --> 01:28:34.947
- Ah!

01:28:36.752 --> 01:28:39.220
I hope nobody I know sees us out here.
We're so weird.

01:29:27.203 --> 01:29:29.103
In sickness and in health.

01:29:29.205 --> 01:29:32.038
- For richer or for poorer.
- For richer or for poorer.

01:29:32.141 --> 01:29:34.109
And I promise my love to you.

01:29:34.210 --> 01:29:36.701
And I promise my love to you.

01:29:36.812 --> 01:29:38.973
And I promise my love to you.

01:29:41.917 --> 01:29:44.317
May I have the rings, please?

01:29:48.724 --> 01:29:51.056
- Pull it off.

01:29:55.431 --> 01:29:57.490
- Well-

01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:00.467
Don't panic, folks. It's only plastic.

01:30:12.848 --> 01:30:14.247
Ramo-

01:30:16.719 --> 01:30:18.584
Oh. Babe?

01:30:23.859 --> 01:30:25.918
Ah. Look at you.

01:30:26.028 --> 01:30:28.326
- Nice work, Ramona.

01:30:42.444 --> 01:30:45.311
Hobart, that's- That's n-

01:30:45.414 --> 01:30:48.178
That's- That's real.

01:30:48.284 --> 01:30:52.186
Yeah, and I still owe you that quarter.

01:30:52.288 --> 01:30:55.280
And I'm gonna spend the rest of my life
trying to pay it back.

01:31:00.563 --> 01:31:02.190
Thank you.

01:31:06.402 --> 01:31:09.166
Hobart, you may kiss the bride.

01:31:21.817 --> 01:31:23.717
All right, Beatrice.

01:31:23.819 --> 01:31:27.220
This song is dedicated to you from Hobart.
Hey, buddy.

01:31:27.323 --> 01:31:28.813
Okay.

01:31:28.924 --> 01:31:31.449
One, two. There we go. That's good.

01:31:47.810 --> 01:31:50.745
- Hey, Beezus, I've been looking for you.
- Oh, hi.

01:31:50.846 --> 01:31:52.746
- Nice wedding, huh?
- Yeah.

01:31:52.848 --> 01:31:54.748
Um-

01:31:56.785 --> 01:31:59.117
Okay, listen. Um, Beezus.

01:31:59.221 --> 01:32:02.884
I know that you're moving, and that's bad.

01:32:02.992 --> 01:32:05.017
But in a way it's also good, because...

01:32:05.127 --> 01:32:08.358
I would never have the guts
to say this if you weren't.

01:32:08.464 --> 01:32:10.091
So...

01:32:11.667 --> 01:32:13.635
I don't think of you as a frlend.

01:32:13.736 --> 01:32:16.466
No, I mean- No. That came out wrong.

01:32:16.572 --> 01:32:19.268
- I mean, I think about you,
like, a lot, all the time.

01:32:19.375 --> 01:32:21.741
It's just- Oh, no. You're laughing.

01:32:23.979 --> 01:32:25.879
Why are you laughing?

01:32:25.981 --> 01:32:29.314
Um- No, I'm sorry.
I'm listening. I am. It's just-

01:32:33.856 --> 01:32:35.824
You've got something on your shirt.

01:32:35.924 --> 01:32:38.324
Oh-

01:32:44.967 --> 01:32:46.434
Gotcha.

01:32:46.535 --> 01:32:49.299
Yeah.

01:32:54.843 --> 01:32:58.006
Um, we should probably go dance
while we can...

01:32:58.113 --> 01:32:59.944
'cause the band has a curfew, so-

01:33:00.049 --> 01:33:02.415
- Oh.
- Yeah, let's dance. Okay.

01:33:17.833 --> 01:33:20.768
- I think it's time for the father-daughter dance.

01:33:24.139 --> 01:33:26.733
You did a wonderful job today, Pickle.

01:33:26.842 --> 01:33:29.811
You were a perfect bridesmaid.

01:33:29.912 --> 01:33:31.345
Thank you.

01:33:34.850 --> 01:33:36.750
- Dad?
- Yeah?

01:33:36.852 --> 01:33:39.480
What were you and Mrs. Meacham
just talking about?

01:33:39.588 --> 01:33:43.684
'Cause whatever I did wrong,
I probably didn't mean it.

01:33:43.792 --> 01:33:46.852
Well, believe it or not,
we weren't talking about you at all.

01:33:46.962 --> 01:33:48.395
Really?

01:33:48.497 --> 01:33:50.863
Yeah, she was talking about an opening...

01:33:50.966 --> 01:33:54.231
for an art teacher at your school next term.

01:33:54.336 --> 01:33:56.304
Remember when she called the house
the other day?

01:33:56.405 --> 01:33:59.966
Well, she told me that she passed
that mural of ours on to the principal...

01:34:00.075 --> 01:34:02.043
who mentioned it to the superintendent.

01:34:02.144 --> 01:34:06.706
Long story short,
it's crummy pay, it's part-time.

01:34:06.815 --> 01:34:10.182
I hear some of those kids
down at your school can be a real handful.

01:34:10.285 --> 01:34:11.547
Oh!

01:34:11.653 --> 01:34:14.986
But I'm thinking I'm gonna take it.

01:34:16.158 --> 01:34:19.889
Oh, my gosh!
That's better than a fireman!

01:34:19.995 --> 01:34:21.394
- I know.

01:34:21.497 --> 01:34:23.362
Mm-hmm!

01:34:23.465 --> 01:34:26.957
- I owe it all to you, Ramona.

01:34:27.069 --> 01:34:29.037
You told me I could do anything.

01:34:29.138 --> 01:34:31.231
It took me this long to believe it.

01:34:32.674 --> 01:34:34.733
You really did save us, kiddo.

01:34:38.180 --> 01:34:39.772
- Whoo!

01:34:39.882 --> 01:34:42.749
- Whoo!

01:34:42.851 --> 01:34:45.684
- Whew!

01:34:56.331 --> 01:34:59.164
- Beezus! Beezus!

01:34:59.268 --> 01:35:01.168
We don't have to move anymore!

01:35:03.972 --> 01:35:06.133
- M mm. Mmm.

01:35:06.241 --> 01:35:07.868
- Mrs. Meacham!
- Yes.

01:35:07.976 --> 01:35:11.104
- I don't have to move anymore.
- I know.

01:35:11.213 --> 01:35:13.738
We'll be together for the rest of the year.

01:35:13.849 --> 01:35:15.976
I shall pace myself accordingly.

01:35:17.619 --> 01:35:19.587
Thanks for helping my dad.

01:35:20.756 --> 01:35:22.724
I just passed along the mural.

01:35:22.825 --> 01:35:24.725
You're the one who inspired it.

01:35:24.827 --> 01:35:29.594
I may not be an art critic, but I certainly
know something "terrifical" when I see it.

01:35:32.601 --> 01:35:34.501
Oh!

01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:39.974
Go on, now.

01:35:40.075 --> 01:35:42.669
- Shake your booty.
- Okay.

01:35:48.784 --> 01:35:53.551
- Oh! Bye!

01:35:53.655 --> 01:35:56.180
- Oh, bye, Mom.

01:35:56.291 --> 01:35:58.259
- I'll call you from Alaska.
- Okay.

01:35:58.360 --> 01:35:59.827
Drive safely.

01:36:02.631 --> 01:36:05.532
- Wait! Don't go yet!

01:36:05.634 --> 01:36:07.534
- Don't go yet, Aunt Bea!

01:36:11.707 --> 01:36:14.005
So you can always have me around.

01:36:23.051 --> 01:36:26.680
Ramona, you're extraordinary.

01:36:35.764 --> 01:36:37.698
- Bye!

01:36:37.799 --> 01:36:40.791
- Bye!
- We love you!
