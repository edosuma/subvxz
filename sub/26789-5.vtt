00:16.808 --> 00:17.809
Hey!

00:18.727 --> 00:21.646
- Good day, Calonice.
- Claire, what are you doing?

00:21.730 --> 00:22.564
Thinking.

00:22.647 --> 00:24.524
You're supposed to be on-stage right now.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.986
"Calonice, it's more than I can bear.

00:28.069 --> 00:30.947
I am hot all over
with blushes for our sex.

00:31.031 --> 00:34.242
- Men say we're slippery rogues..."
- "And aren't they right?"

00:35.243 --> 00:36.244
Come on, let's go.

00:41.124 --> 00:42.124
Come on.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.044
We're all gonna die one day.

00:45.795 --> 00:46.795
What?

00:47.213 --> 00:48.506
I'm gonna be dead,

00:49.215 --> 00:50.759
you're gonna be dead.

00:50.842 --> 00:52.218
They're all gonna be dead.

00:52.302 --> 00:53.553
Everybody.

00:53.636 --> 00:55.805
What the fuck are you talking about?

00:57.849 --> 01:00.602
Are those my earrings?

01:01.686 --> 01:05.355
I... didn't think you'd care.

01:08.318 --> 01:09.402
You do it.

01:10.111 --> 01:12.113
You be Lysistrata.
You know all my lines, right?

01:12.197 --> 01:13.531
You can't just...

01:18.203 --> 01:20.497
What about the show? Claire!

03:27.415 --> 03:30.460
We are almost good.
We just have to adjust the lights.

03:30.543 --> 03:31.586
That's fine.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.839
I did want to thank you personally
for doing this.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.424
I really appreciate it.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.603
Wait till we're finished
before you do that.

03:38.635 --> 03:41.554
Well, I won't deviate from the questions.

03:42.138 --> 03:44.974
You can ask me anything,
as long as it's about the...

03:45.058 --> 03:46.267
the president.

03:47.310 --> 03:50.270
Can you get away from me with that? - My apologies.
- I'm fine.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.000
Sorry, Mr. Shepherd. It's just
that the lights are pretty harsh.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.401
It's fine. Let's go.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.405
This Russia debacle,

03:59.489 --> 04:02.367
it's essentially a 20% tax

04:02.450 --> 04:06.371
on American companies that are just
over there trying to help out the region.

04:06.454 --> 04:10.208
It's the latest in a series of...

04:10.833 --> 04:14.462
disastrous steps taken
by this White House.

04:15.546 --> 04:16.630
And you wonder...

04:16.714 --> 04:19.259
You wonder why Congress
was looking at legislation

04:19.341 --> 04:21.902
- to take the nuclear button away from her.
- As a patriot,

04:23.888 --> 04:28.476
as an American who loves his country
and, yes, his company,

04:29.519 --> 04:30.853
we can do better.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.273
We can do so much better.

04:33.356 --> 04:38.319
Even Bill Shepherd, who the last time
he was interviewed on air was never...

04:38.403 --> 04:40.113
Even he felt compelled to speak out.

04:40.196 --> 04:43.157
She's the head of my party,
and I have to say, I'm at a loss.

04:43.241 --> 04:46.911
- Her entire schedule is empty.
- Presidents have gone missing before...

04:46.995 --> 04:49.555
But there's a difference between
clearing your head at Camp David

04:49.622 --> 04:51.582
and going full-blown Howard Hughes.

04:51.666 --> 04:56.170
She hasn't been seen publicly
in three weeks or heard from.

04:56.254 --> 04:59.007
Except for a late night pardon
for her husband's chief of staff.

04:59.090 --> 05:03.011
- Which many consider a strategic mistake.
- Well, Doug Stamper has issues.

05:03.094 --> 05:05.263
Everyone in her administration has issues.

05:05.346 --> 05:07.849
Sean Jeffries, the press secretary,
has resigned.

05:07.932 --> 05:09.934
And there are probably
more departures to come.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.853
Her cabinet has had enough.

05:11.936 --> 05:14.939
And if she thinks a pardon
is gonna keep the US Attorney away,

05:15.023 --> 05:15.857
- she's...
- She's...

05:15.940 --> 05:18.943
- Depressed.
- I don't know about depressed.

05:19.068 --> 05:22.697
You know, she looks either very disturbed,
or depressed.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.907
But, I mean, "disturbed"?
Can you really say that?

05:24.991 --> 05:25.867
Yeah. Look, hold on.

05:25.950 --> 05:29.620
I'm asking a very real question
about her ability to lead here.

05:29.704 --> 05:31.831
Have you seen this photo? Because we have.

05:31.914 --> 05:36.294
Now we're not here to diagnose,
but you look at this, and you need to ask.

05:36.377 --> 05:38.463
On behalf of our country,

05:38.546 --> 05:42.300
that woman undid 30 years
of foreign policy

05:42.383 --> 05:46.304
by acting like,
pardon my French, a...

05:46.554 --> 05:49.390
But now,
now we're into a new phase.

05:49.474 --> 05:52.393
When the White House lights are on,
but nobody's home.

05:52.477 --> 05:54.979
I mean, she's home, but she won't leave.

05:55.063 --> 05:59.275
Been hunkered down in there
for 23 days and counting.

05:59.359 --> 06:02.236
Apparently, she's stopped doing anything.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.780
She's paralyzed.

06:03.863 --> 06:06.282
A paralyzed...

06:06.783 --> 06:09.827
And there's nothing more dangerous
than a paralyzed...

06:10.536 --> 06:14.374
Seriously,
I think she might be the worst thing

06:14.457 --> 06:16.667
that has ever happened to this country.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.586
SOS.

06:18.669 --> 06:22.048
Save our souls, save our ships,

06:22.131 --> 06:23.466
Take your pick.

06:26.177 --> 06:27.595
This is real.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.933
I'm Melody Cruz, and that's what I got.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.230
Hi.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.858
That's quite a snapshot, right?

06:41.984 --> 06:44.404
Unique. Carefully calibrated.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.990
Pain, hysteria

06:48.074 --> 06:50.451
and just a small dose of crazy.

06:51.077 --> 06:53.871
Claire Underwood,
like they've never seen before.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.795
It's actually not as easy as it looks.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.465
See, in order for me to make that face,

07:04.549 --> 07:06.092
I have to imagine...

07:06.717 --> 07:09.262
the perfect combination of things.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.514
Here's the recipe.

07:12.348 --> 07:15.017
First, I have to think about all the ways

07:15.101 --> 07:19.564
in which men have tried
to manage me my whole life.

07:20.356 --> 07:22.275
Then, I think of...

07:23.234 --> 07:26.320
America's worst fear...

07:28.448 --> 07:31.159
when it comes to a female
in the Oval Office.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.096
- Her schedule has been cleared.
- And finally...

07:36.664 --> 07:40.209
...my biggest regret...
Francis J. Underwood.

07:53.556 --> 07:54.724
Madam President.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.732
Are you ill?

08:05.776 --> 08:08.196
If you're ill,
I'll call the White House physician.

08:16.621 --> 08:17.621
Claire.

08:18.247 --> 08:19.916
Just get out, Mark.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.628
- Claire, this has to stop.
- Please, just leave me alone.

08:25.129 --> 08:29.091
You are alarming the nation.
You need to get up.

08:31.302 --> 08:32.302
Listen.

08:38.476 --> 08:40.436
I've prepared a short statement

08:40.937 --> 08:43.606
explaining your absence
and announcing your return.

08:43.688 --> 08:46.817
You can deliver it
in the Rose Garden this afternoon.

08:46.901 --> 08:49.278
I promise you
this is for both of our sakes.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.030
You don't understand...

08:51.113 --> 08:52.233
If you would, please.

08:55.451 --> 08:56.451
Claire...

08:57.119 --> 08:58.120
look at me.

08:59.288 --> 09:00.706
- Look at me.
- Get out.

09:01.415 --> 09:02.959
Please get out. Just leave me alone.

09:03.042 --> 09:06.337
You are not only digging your own grave,
you are burying the presidency. Stop it.

09:06.420 --> 09:07.420
You can try.

09:08.005 --> 09:10.258
- Can you try?
- I can't, Mark.

09:10.508 --> 09:11.842
I just can't.

09:14.595 --> 09:17.265
I can't.

09:31.028 --> 09:32.154
Don't worry.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.489
I have a plan.

09:39.579 --> 09:40.580
Excuse me.

09:43.541 --> 09:44.541
Sir.

09:46.419 --> 09:47.587
We're good here?

09:47.962 --> 09:49.422
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

09:50.923 --> 09:53.426
Was it paranoia or is it due diligence?

09:53.968 --> 09:55.052
You tell me, Mark.

09:55.136 --> 09:59.348
We both just lived through
what that bitch is capable of.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.767
Something is definitely wrong.

10:02.226 --> 10:03.226
She...

10:05.187 --> 10:06.188
Coffee?

10:07.440 --> 10:10.276
I mean, she can't even
put two sentences together.

10:10.943 --> 10:11.861
Are you sure?

10:11.944 --> 10:13.821
I've never seen her like this.
She's a mess.

10:14.196 --> 10:15.196
Well...

10:15.448 --> 10:19.243
Either way,
that doesn't change where we are.

10:19.869 --> 10:20.995
And, Mark...

10:21.746 --> 10:22.913
when Conway imploded,

10:23.414 --> 10:26.792
we recognized
that you were a little squea...

10:26.876 --> 10:28.919
squeamish about stepping in.

10:29.503 --> 10:31.172
And we appreciate that.

10:31.547 --> 10:32.673
But it's time.

10:34.592 --> 10:35.801
You'll make a great president.

10:35.885 --> 10:39.013
- We'll see to that.
- Now, wait, wait. Let's be clear, okay?

10:40.640 --> 10:43.142
I know we've been hitting her pretty hard,

10:43.225 --> 10:45.603
but I can't condone another attempt.

10:45.686 --> 10:47.480
- I can't.
- Calm down.

10:47.563 --> 10:49.440
My God, Mark. I mean, really.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.108
There are other ways.

10:51.609 --> 10:54.070
Okay, so we're talking about impeachment

10:54.320 --> 10:55.613
or a congressional government?

10:55.696 --> 10:58.407
25th Amendment, Section 4.

10:59.950 --> 11:02.453
- Which has never been used.
- It's built for speed,

11:02.536 --> 11:05.122
intended to smother a crisis
of confidence.

11:05.831 --> 11:07.249
Reassure the public.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.959
Reassure the world

11:09.043 --> 11:11.253
that continuity remains
at the American government,

11:11.337 --> 11:13.214
even if a president becomes...

11:13.464 --> 11:17.051
- Unable to fulfill his duties.
- Her duties.

11:17.134 --> 11:19.512
- It requires her to be unfit.
- And she is.

11:21.722 --> 11:22.765
I mean...

11:23.015 --> 11:25.309
our lawyers have already looked into this.

11:25.393 --> 11:27.395
She only needs to be deficient.

11:27.478 --> 11:30.731
The language is vague and accommodating.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.610
Mark, if you have any doubt about this

11:34.694 --> 11:36.320
- at all...
- I'm just listening.

11:39.031 --> 11:40.574
The Cabinet is yours.

11:41.450 --> 11:44.704
You have relationships inside the Senate,

11:44.787 --> 11:47.123
the House, on both sides of the aisle.

11:47.748 --> 11:49.291
It's a natural fit.

11:49.375 --> 11:52.461
But the thing has to cascade with...

11:52.545 --> 11:53.838
Precision.

11:53.921 --> 11:57.425
A chain reaction beginning
with a letter to Congress,

11:57.967 --> 12:00.511
signed by the vice president

12:01.470 --> 12:05.349
and a majority of his Cabinet,
recommending my removal from office.

12:06.517 --> 12:08.769
And how do I know
that's what they'll try to do?

12:10.521 --> 12:12.565
Because the 25th gets personal.

12:13.524 --> 12:16.068
Bill likes me being the damsel
in distress.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.071
He wishes I were.

12:25.494 --> 12:26.537
Where you headed?

12:27.246 --> 12:28.873
I have family up north.

12:28.956 --> 12:29.956
Where?

12:30.291 --> 12:31.333
North.

12:33.627 --> 12:35.337
Cathy's sister still on the Cape?

12:36.839 --> 12:38.048
Hyannis, right?

12:40.134 --> 12:41.134
It's good.

12:41.469 --> 12:42.762
Family's important.

12:43.220 --> 12:45.741
- Especially during trying times...
- I'd invite you in, but I really...

12:45.765 --> 12:47.808
There's still something
that I can't get straight.

12:47.892 --> 12:50.311
If we could go through it
one more time. So...

12:50.394 --> 12:52.938
she was picked up by car
to be taken to the doctor.

12:53.022 --> 12:57.502
- She wasn't feeling well. - You were with her the whole
time -leading up to the embolism? - Mr. Stamper, enough!

12:58.068 --> 12:59.788
I'm just trying
to understand what happened.

13:01.238 --> 13:04.200
I don't need you
coming around here anymore.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.160
You know exactly what happened.

13:06.243 --> 13:08.746
You have the coroner's conclusions.
And that's that.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.545
I'm in mourning for my wife,

13:17.296 --> 13:20.841
and I'm not reliving the final moments
of her life anymore. Not with you.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.552
I think your wife was murdered.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.267
I'm closing the door now.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.668
- Hello.
<i>- Doug. Fred Amburg here.</i>

13:57.628 --> 13:59.922
- Whose phone is this?
<i>- This one's mine.</i>

14:00.005 --> 14:01.131
I just got out.

14:01.215 --> 14:02.424
<i>I had no idea.</i>

14:02.800 --> 14:04.176
<i>I talked to Cole this morning.</i>

14:04.426 --> 14:07.388
Heard an interesting thing
about our esteemed shrink.

14:07.805 --> 14:11.141
You know, that sabbatical, leave,
walkabout, whatever you want to call it.

14:12.184 --> 14:13.894
<i>You are looking for him, aren't you?</i>

14:14.186 --> 14:15.104
Yes.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.815
<i>He's in a cabin down in Virginia.</i>

14:40.546 --> 14:41.546
Here you go.

14:48.804 --> 14:50.014
Would you mind if I...?

14:50.556 --> 14:51.556
Thanks.

15:09.491 --> 15:10.659
Oh, hello?

15:10.743 --> 15:14.163
<i>Don't say another word.
Don't speak. Just wait.</i>

15:19.460 --> 15:20.460
Ah...

15:38.812 --> 15:41.690
My apologies, I took a wrong turn
and wound up in some stairwell.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.360
We don't have much time
until we have to get back upstairs.

15:45.986 --> 15:49.114
When Marcy first came to me
with this proposition,

15:50.908 --> 15:54.203
I was stunned, to say the least.

15:55.329 --> 15:56.580
Until recently I...

15:56.914 --> 16:00.084
I don't know. I didn't realize
how truly bad things were.

16:00.417 --> 16:01.752
But unseat the president?

16:01.835 --> 16:03.253
Jesus Christ.

16:04.338 --> 16:05.673
President's my friend.

16:08.300 --> 16:12.179
And while I worry about her mental state,

16:12.262 --> 16:14.807
I worry about the state
of this nation more.

16:14.890 --> 16:18.310
Mr. Vice President, I admire you greatly.

16:18.727 --> 16:20.688
But I'm not used to this kind of thing.

16:20.771 --> 16:22.564
Back rooms, after hours.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.358
We need to take every precaution.

16:24.441 --> 16:27.027
And yet we're still at risk
just by being here.

16:27.111 --> 16:28.195
I'm sorry,

16:28.278 --> 16:31.031
but I believe in the sanctity
of the office of the presidency.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.915
And that's exactly why we're here.

16:32.950 --> 16:35.035
You're asking us to betray an oath.

16:35.119 --> 16:36.745
I'm asking you to speak your mind.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.957
A concentrated effort,
all of us in this room.

16:40.749 --> 16:42.268
We may not be able to save the president,

16:42.292 --> 16:44.837
but we may just be able
to save our administration.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.506
The 25th is not just about timing.

16:48.215 --> 16:49.967
It's about secrecy.

16:50.050 --> 16:52.970
- And the Senate hasn't kept a secret...
- Earl, I appreciate that.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.305
I have the House,
and I'll take care of the Senate.

16:55.389 --> 16:56.449
I'll prepare a letter

16:56.473 --> 16:58.726
detailing the president's dereliction
of duty,

16:58.809 --> 17:01.854
laying out a case for Congress
and for posterity.

17:02.563 --> 17:04.481
And when the time comes,
you'll all be notified.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.191
Look, we're all patriots here.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.944
Our first concern,

17:09.403 --> 17:11.989
our only concern, has got to be...

17:13.031 --> 17:14.782
the survival of our nation.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.219
Fuck! Ah!

18:21.183 --> 18:23.435
Sit and take a deep breath.

18:26.146 --> 18:27.146
Sit down.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.903
Dr. Rosen, sit down.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.040
How did you get in here?

18:52.548 --> 18:55.008
I'm assuming you're here
because you're suffering.

18:56.718 --> 18:58.637
And if it's not over Zoe Barnes,

18:59.221 --> 19:02.432
it's over some other soul
that you've torn apart.

19:02.516 --> 19:03.516
No.

19:04.226 --> 19:07.312
You're assuming I'm here because
I figured out what you took from me.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.732
- Took?
- Kept.

19:15.320 --> 19:19.199
All personal property
should have been returned upon release.

19:19.283 --> 19:21.743
You're right. It should have.

19:22.744 --> 19:25.747
There's no accounting for the behavior
of supposed professionals.

19:29.626 --> 19:34.256
I once met this psychologist, socially,

19:34.339 --> 19:37.759
who told me about a party that
she hosted once for a group of her peers.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.720
It was just a roomful of shrinks.

19:40.137 --> 19:42.222
At the end of the night,
she was cleaning up,

19:42.306 --> 19:43.515
she went into the bathroom

19:44.141 --> 19:47.102
and she saw that one of her colleagues
had smeared shit

19:47.728 --> 19:49.313
all over the bathroom wall.

19:49.771 --> 19:52.816
Now, what kind of fucked up person
would do something like that?

19:55.694 --> 19:58.530
Well, I guess it's true what they say.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.699
That shrinks
are the most fucked up of all.

20:04.411 --> 20:06.455
Such a violence to that act.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.084
But violence is a funny thing.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.880
You know, it's not so much
the physical pain

20:14.963 --> 20:16.506
that can victims can remember.

20:17.549 --> 20:19.384
It's the feelings around it.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.554
The fear.

20:25.140 --> 20:27.226
Where is it? The will you intercepted?
Where is it?

20:27.309 --> 20:29.478
I don't have it anymore.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.191
I don't have it!

20:36.860 --> 20:38.278
What was in it?

20:42.824 --> 20:44.618
He left you everything.

21:02.636 --> 21:03.636
God...

21:08.183 --> 21:09.184
Take it.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.520
Thank you.

21:16.149 --> 21:18.026
I thought it was a strange question.

21:19.736 --> 21:20.736
What?

21:21.029 --> 21:23.490
When you asked me what Francis Underwood
had given me.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.744
That's how the will ends.

21:28.870 --> 21:30.539
"Remember the last thing I gave you."

21:38.964 --> 21:41.925
Don't call her or I'll be back.

21:44.594 --> 21:46.513
Hope you figure out your problems, Doctor.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.003
Take it.

22:20.422 --> 22:22.132
If you want it, it's yours.

22:26.845 --> 22:29.848
Do you ever wonder if you're living
somebody else's life?

22:30.349 --> 22:32.059
Whose life are you living, Jane?

22:32.142 --> 22:33.894
Not me. You.

22:34.394 --> 22:36.938
You seem to be struggling
with your identity.

22:37.022 --> 22:39.608
If that's not too impertinent
to say to a...

22:40.025 --> 22:41.360
sitting president.

22:44.071 --> 22:46.406
Come keep me company
while I put my jammies on.

22:54.790 --> 22:55.790
Please.

23:05.425 --> 23:09.471
Your little show of compliance
at the funeral

23:09.554 --> 23:13.308
as you made your side deal with Victor.

23:15.560 --> 23:16.978
Makes me wonder.

23:19.106 --> 23:20.315
And now what?

23:21.233 --> 23:22.484
What do you call this show?

23:22.567 --> 23:26.947
How to turn 323 million people against you
in three short weeks?

23:27.739 --> 23:29.366
Congratulations, Claire.

23:29.449 --> 23:32.202
You've become a problem for everybody.

23:33.370 --> 23:34.370
And...

23:35.539 --> 23:36.915
Just so you know,

23:38.708 --> 23:40.752
Syria may be too far gone.

23:40.836 --> 23:42.587
Tell me what to do, Jane.

23:45.632 --> 23:47.175
I was at an event tonight.

23:48.343 --> 23:50.595
An event the president usually attends.

23:52.431 --> 23:53.932
And how was that evening?

23:56.726 --> 23:59.229
The storm that's gathering is a rough one.

24:01.314 --> 24:03.066
When you think they'll strike?

24:05.902 --> 24:06.902
I have no idea.

24:13.243 --> 24:14.327
It's late.

24:14.744 --> 24:16.538
That's exactly what I'm saying.

24:21.626 --> 24:23.462
I think I should move out.

24:28.758 --> 24:30.051
I understand.

24:35.223 --> 24:37.517
Stick to this course, Madam President,

24:38.059 --> 24:39.227
and...

24:52.949 --> 24:54.034
Full house.

24:54.117 --> 24:55.994
You must be looking for different answers

24:56.077 --> 24:58.347
to the same questions
we've been going over for the last...

24:58.371 --> 24:59.247
Now, 24 days.

24:59.331 --> 25:03.531
And the president still hasn't left the residence.
- And this is where I say... - Kelsey, come on.

25:06.213 --> 25:08.798
For now, the ground-breaking accord
with Russia,

25:08.882 --> 25:12.636
which aims for a just and lasting peace
in Syria, speaks for itself.

25:12.719 --> 25:13.762
So,

25:13.845 --> 25:18.016
unless there are any more questions,
or shall I say new questions? Yes.

25:18.391 --> 25:20.685
Isn't the vice president
really the one running the show,

25:20.769 --> 25:22.979
essentially acting as president?

25:24.397 --> 25:26.733
There are members of the cabinet
who are saying as much.

25:28.026 --> 25:30.904
Well, firstly, I would refrain
from using the word "show,"

25:30.987 --> 25:33.448
when it comes to the White House.

25:33.532 --> 25:36.284
And... yeah. That's all for today.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.453
Thank you.

25:44.042 --> 25:45.710
Are you sure you're not hungry?

25:45.919 --> 25:47.337
The soup is quite nice.

25:50.340 --> 25:51.800
I don't know how you can...

25:52.175 --> 25:53.175
Eat?

25:54.761 --> 25:56.846
No, I'm...

25:57.514 --> 25:58.932
glad to see you're eating.

26:01.351 --> 26:04.396
Madam President, it's beyond repair.

26:04.479 --> 26:06.523
You understand that, at this point?

26:08.817 --> 26:10.610
You've lost the Hill.

26:10.694 --> 26:12.279
You've lost your cabinet.

26:13.321 --> 26:14.698
You've lost the country.

26:17.033 --> 26:18.159
You've lost.

26:20.829 --> 26:23.123
Your own party can't even
find a reason to support you.

26:23.623 --> 26:25.041
I entreat you...

26:25.125 --> 26:26.668
You entreat me?

26:30.046 --> 26:31.046
Resign.

26:32.215 --> 26:35.295
And are you speaking to me as vice
president? I'm speaking to you as a person.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.430
Blame it on...

26:40.348 --> 26:44.769
the strain after Francis' death,
the strain of the office itself.

26:44.853 --> 26:48.857
Language can be found,
but the best you can hope for now...

26:50.734 --> 26:52.652
is a dignified exit.

27:04.122 --> 27:07.250
What's so moving about him
is he can't help himself.

27:07.709 --> 27:10.420
He can't help being decent. Human.

27:11.671 --> 27:13.506
His glorious flaw.

27:14.716 --> 27:16.384
What this means is

27:16.843 --> 27:18.345
they're gonna go through with it.

27:23.642 --> 27:24.809
No, Mark.

27:25.727 --> 27:27.437
I'm staying right where I am.

27:55.215 --> 27:57.295
You got two minutes.
That's not Rachel Posner.

28:04.641 --> 28:05.641
Is it?

28:06.935 --> 28:08.478
You knew Rachel Posner.

28:09.104 --> 28:11.231
Uh, I mean...

28:11.606 --> 28:12.899
yeah, I guess.

28:12.982 --> 28:14.984
Enough to use her name
for someone else's ID?

28:15.068 --> 28:17.445
That's what you do, isn't it?
Kind of pay the names forward?

28:17.529 --> 28:18.363
No.

28:18.446 --> 28:19.948
What name did you give Rachel?

28:21.658 --> 28:22.658
I don't remember.

28:23.451 --> 28:24.451
I don't.

28:24.619 --> 28:26.162
When did you last see her?

28:26.246 --> 28:30.291
Come on. Um...
Couple of years ago or something.

28:30.625 --> 28:32.085
It was where she worked.

28:32.377 --> 28:33.377
Is she dead?

28:37.048 --> 28:39.426
- I got nothing to do with that.
- Did you help kill her?

28:39.509 --> 28:40.509
Oh.

28:40.927 --> 28:42.345
I'm talking to you.

28:45.432 --> 28:48.601
Hey, hey, hey, man. I want my lawyer.

28:49.728 --> 28:50.812
Do you know...

28:51.604 --> 28:52.605
Doug Stamper?

28:53.314 --> 28:54.314
No.

28:54.983 --> 28:56.151
What name did you give her?

28:56.526 --> 28:57.527
What was her name?

28:58.778 --> 28:59.612
Lisa.

28:59.696 --> 29:02.157
- Lisa?
- Yeah. Lisa Cassie.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.533
- Lisa Cassie?
- Cassie, Lisa.

29:03.616 --> 29:05.535
<i>- Yeah.
- Lisa and Cassie?</i>

29:48.119 --> 29:49.662
Back at the White House.

29:51.164 --> 29:52.540
You took his room.

29:54.751 --> 29:55.835
It's bigger.

29:59.422 --> 30:03.218
Can you tell me why it was so important
that we meet here and now?

30:04.010 --> 30:06.387
Honestly, I was hoping we could meet
in the West Wing.

30:06.930 --> 30:08.890
I haven't left the residence in...

30:09.849 --> 30:11.893
Well, I'm sure you still read the news.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.230
And your pardon...

30:15.730 --> 30:17.816
hasn't helped me or Francis.

30:19.192 --> 30:20.985
I don't feel comfortable here.

30:24.322 --> 30:27.408
Whatever bad memories
you may have, Doug...

30:28.785 --> 30:31.454
sometimes it takes a long time
to understand

30:31.538 --> 30:33.790
who's the real source of our harm.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.627
And I have failed to make you trust me,

30:38.461 --> 30:39.754
and that's a shame.

30:47.262 --> 30:48.721
I trust what I know.

30:51.349 --> 30:53.560
You have enemies,
and they underestimate you.

30:54.018 --> 30:56.020
And how do you think they'll come at me?

30:56.938 --> 30:59.399
Has Congressman Cole said anything to you?

31:01.442 --> 31:02.652
I think she's alive.

31:02.986 --> 31:04.112
Cathy Durant.

31:04.737 --> 31:06.817
I don't know where she is
or what she's up to, but...

31:07.949 --> 31:09.450
I knew you'd want to know.

31:16.916 --> 31:18.376
I want you to know something.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.589
Francis died in this room.

31:23.047 --> 31:25.550
I told everyone it was in my bed.

31:27.135 --> 31:30.013
But it was right there on the floor.

31:30.638 --> 31:31.931
Whoever killed him.

31:37.520 --> 31:39.188
Am I missing something?

31:40.690 --> 31:41.983
Whoever killed him

31:42.317 --> 31:45.320
will get what she or he deserves.

31:55.455 --> 31:58.082
Timing decided the shape of the universe.

31:58.625 --> 31:59.709
Who said that?

31:59.792 --> 32:00.792
Me.

32:02.128 --> 32:04.422
Hell is truth seen too late.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.091
Did you say that?

32:07.508 --> 32:08.801
Thomas Hobbes.

32:10.345 --> 32:11.345
Usher...

32:12.513 --> 32:13.514
your bet.

32:14.724 --> 32:17.518
- Hmm. I'll check, please.
- Don't be polite.

32:18.061 --> 32:19.520
I played with you before.

32:19.854 --> 32:21.064
I know you're holding.

32:21.272 --> 32:22.106
Bill, you sure?

32:22.190 --> 32:24.275
I can deal you in on the next hand.

32:24.692 --> 32:27.528
- I don't play.
- Is it true she's a basket case?

32:27.612 --> 32:29.864
Or just a plain old Democrat.

32:29.948 --> 32:32.408
So, I'll have the letter.

32:32.867 --> 32:34.410
That's a hundred to see mine.

32:34.494 --> 32:36.162
And when it comes time, Hank,

32:36.245 --> 32:39.499
I don't want to end up on the Senate floor
with a piece of paper in one hand...

32:39.582 --> 32:42.627
And your balls in the other?
We've all been there.

32:42.710 --> 32:44.379
Just keep my balls out of it.

32:44.462 --> 32:46.923
Usher, you want me to whip,
but you don't want me

32:47.006 --> 32:49.258
to tell my senators
what they're voting on.

32:49.717 --> 32:51.427
And pass without debate.

32:51.511 --> 32:52.511
I'm out.

32:53.012 --> 32:54.931
At least tell me what they're getting.

32:56.349 --> 32:58.685
A new resident in the White House.

33:03.648 --> 33:06.275
Well, Mr. President.

33:07.110 --> 33:08.903
Are you in or are you out?

33:12.532 --> 33:13.532
I call.

33:15.034 --> 33:16.034
And...

33:17.412 --> 33:19.664
Um... bump you 500.

33:24.711 --> 33:27.380
I would never call this enemy territory.

33:28.548 --> 33:30.091
It might sound quaint,

33:30.633 --> 33:32.093
but I believe in the Republic.

33:32.176 --> 33:34.554
Oh. Well, thank you for coming.

33:36.806 --> 33:39.851
It's not sustainable.

33:40.226 --> 33:42.103
This media onslaught.

33:42.520 --> 33:46.024
I wonder if you'd consider
calling off the dogs.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.819
All I'm asking for is a pause.
Couple of days or so.

33:50.611 --> 33:52.655
You flatter me, Madam President.

33:53.072 --> 33:55.324
But my reach only goes so far.

33:55.408 --> 33:57.160
It seems they want you to resign.

33:57.618 --> 33:58.661
Who's they?

33:58.745 --> 33:59.746
Who isn't?

34:00.163 --> 34:01.080
Pardon my bluntness.

34:01.164 --> 34:03.875
Oh, no, I enjoy bluntness. Saves time.

34:03.958 --> 34:07.253
But should I resign
for the high crime of being a female?

34:07.336 --> 34:09.547
Oh, I think the reasoning
goes deeper than that.

34:10.255 --> 34:11.466
I think...

34:12.382 --> 34:14.802
and this is just my perspective,

34:15.094 --> 34:17.054
- if you want to hear it.
- Oh, please.

34:18.222 --> 34:20.433
Dueling agendas between my family,

34:20.516 --> 34:24.395
and, well, you,
have taken on their own life.

34:24.937 --> 34:28.940
And in some sense,
your husband just won't leave you alone,

34:29.567 --> 34:30.567
will he?

34:33.862 --> 34:35.656
I can't change history.

34:35.739 --> 34:37.574
I'll bet sometimes you'd like to.

34:39.452 --> 34:41.079
Wouldn't you like to erase him?

34:42.205 --> 34:43.205
Madam President...

34:44.290 --> 34:46.208
your dead husband told my mother things.

34:46.292 --> 34:48.503
Things you don't want the world to know.

34:48.585 --> 34:52.547
A dead man's words are worthless
as far as I'm concerned.

34:52.924 --> 34:55.217
Not when his claims can be verified.

34:59.013 --> 35:02.642
It's possible to make the memory
of a person disappear.

35:04.018 --> 35:05.061
Digitally.

35:05.937 --> 35:08.439
Move them far
into the background, anyways.

35:10.191 --> 35:11.400
There are ways.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.320
Algorithms.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.200
You're a very confident young man.

35:19.951 --> 35:21.828
Even your deeds can go away.

35:21.911 --> 35:24.997
Now, I can make it easier
for all of us to work together.

35:26.040 --> 35:28.000
Does your mother know you're here?

35:32.171 --> 35:33.171
No.

35:35.925 --> 35:37.845
Just out of curiosity,
what's your first memory?

35:41.472 --> 35:43.099
Your first memory of her?

35:44.809 --> 35:46.269
That's a strange question.

35:46.352 --> 35:48.646
I was just curious.

35:51.649 --> 35:55.319
I have a photograph of her catching me.

35:57.321 --> 35:59.782
My mother had thrown me up into the air,

35:59.866 --> 36:03.619
and my uncle snapped a picture
on his new Nikon camera.

36:05.913 --> 36:07.081
She's beaming.

36:08.374 --> 36:09.500
Gleeful.

36:12.170 --> 36:13.629
I treasure that photo.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.592
It's how I like to think of her.

36:21.596 --> 36:23.306
Do me a favor.

36:23.389 --> 36:24.932
Ask Annette...

36:25.016 --> 36:27.894
Ask your mother where you came from.

36:41.657 --> 36:43.034
It's still light out?

36:48.331 --> 36:49.874
You're very dehydrating.

37:04.931 --> 37:06.182
I know, I know.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.851
You want to talk about the deal.

37:12.688 --> 37:15.107
You excluded me, Jane.

37:17.443 --> 37:20.029
When the dust settles,
I'll give you what you want.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.908
Never doubted your value.

37:44.637 --> 37:46.264
Have you seen my phone?

37:48.766 --> 37:50.142
It's in the restroom.

38:21.882 --> 38:22.883
Shit.

38:30.433 --> 38:32.518
Did you do something to my...

38:46.741 --> 38:48.617
I went to the EPA.

38:48.826 --> 38:50.411
There is nothing.

38:50.870 --> 38:52.371
Jesus Christ.

38:54.415 --> 38:56.584
There are people walking around this town,

38:56.667 --> 38:59.587
dressed down, acting like they belong.
But I know they don't.

39:00.421 --> 39:03.466
- Have you been threatened?
- Come on, they're too smart for that.

39:06.010 --> 39:08.721
Well, so they're following you.

39:09.221 --> 39:12.933
- But if there's nothing, then there's...
- I have screenshots...

39:14.393 --> 39:15.811
of the e-mail chain.

39:18.647 --> 39:20.524
'Cause it's wrong what they did.

39:21.442 --> 39:24.153
'Cause I'm so stupid.

39:24.236 --> 39:25.996
So stupid to believe
in doing the right thing

39:26.072 --> 39:27.948
in this totally fucked up world.

39:32.620 --> 39:36.220
There's an e-mail from Bill Shepherd's office
in the chain. I told you. They knew.

39:39.543 --> 39:41.087
They knew somebody was gonna die.

39:48.844 --> 39:50.096
I gotta go.

39:58.604 --> 40:00.314
Hey! Hey, wait.

40:01.399 --> 40:02.399
What?

40:02.608 --> 40:03.734
Your phone.

40:04.485 --> 40:06.362
- What about it?
- I don't trust it.

40:06.779 --> 40:10.533
I got rid of mine. I swear, it felt like
they were following my phone and not me.

40:10.616 --> 40:13.911
- How?
- Look, I gotta go. I'll reach out to you.

40:13.994 --> 40:16.414
- Okay?
- No. What...

40:47.278 --> 40:50.364
She's somewhere in Saudi Arabia.

40:51.657 --> 40:55.161
Ma'am, she poses a significant risk
in enemy hands. You know that.

40:55.244 --> 40:57.913
The United States does not negotiate
with terrorists.

40:57.997 --> 41:00.624
No negotiations.
Options are being drawn up at SOCOM.

41:00.708 --> 41:03.127
But nothing can happen
without an executive order.

41:03.627 --> 41:04.503
Well, then.

41:04.587 --> 41:06.630
That's gonna have to happen
when you're president.

41:06.714 --> 41:09.550
No one's secrets are safe
with Jane in captivity.

41:10.551 --> 41:13.345
That may be more concerning for you
than it is for me.

41:14.847 --> 41:17.683
Kicking the hornet's nest.
Time to move this thing along.

41:20.102 --> 41:22.646
- You arrogant little prick.
- Please, just calm down.

41:22.730 --> 41:24.090
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

41:24.148 --> 41:25.774
I'm not staying if there's name-calling.

41:25.858 --> 41:28.194
Oh. There's not enough names
to call him, Annie.

41:28.277 --> 41:31.280
- Such stunning stupidity.
- Nice alliteration, Uncle Bill.

41:31.363 --> 41:33.574
This towel is smarter than you.

41:34.116 --> 41:36.494
This window is smarter than you.

41:36.994 --> 41:38.829
This rug is smarter than you.

41:39.163 --> 41:41.123
- Hello, Seth.
- Hello, sir.

41:41.207 --> 41:43.083
Seth is smarter than you!

41:43.626 --> 41:46.295
The sweat on my brow
is smarter than you, Duncan.

41:46.378 --> 41:48.797
- Jesus H. Christ, spare us.
- Because sweat on my brow,

41:48.881 --> 41:51.258
would have at least known
not to pay an unsanctioned visit

41:51.342 --> 41:53.942
- to the President of the United States.
- Get your hands off him.

41:55.012 --> 41:56.931
I know you're not feeling well, but...

41:57.723 --> 41:59.892
Well, what the hell
is that supposed to mean, anyway?

41:59.975 --> 42:01.143
You can't act like this.

42:01.227 --> 42:03.395
You know, I was trying to help.
She invited me and...

42:03.479 --> 42:05.231
And you went, like a fucking idiot...

42:05.314 --> 42:06.524
I wanted to be a bridge.

42:06.607 --> 42:09.193
Shut up, both of you, just shut up.

42:09.276 --> 42:11.320
God, is there anything
we haven't done for you?

42:11.403 --> 42:13.364
Well, you know,
that's what people do for family.

42:13.447 --> 42:15.950
- Anything.
- Listen, you shouldn't have gone.

42:16.367 --> 42:18.786
She can't be trusted,
as I've told you a million times.

42:18.869 --> 42:20.538
He jeopardized our timing.

42:20.621 --> 42:22.540
He jeopardized our timing with her!

42:22.623 --> 42:24.917
I can't stand the sound
of male arguing anymore.

42:25.000 --> 42:26.835
You know, she told me
to ask you something.

42:27.920 --> 42:30.256
She told me to ask you where I came from.

42:38.556 --> 42:40.766
Seth. Seth!

42:42.268 --> 42:43.477
Sixteen weeks.

42:43.811 --> 42:45.531
The one from the pregnancy
with her husband.

42:45.563 --> 42:47.022
Annie, I do think it'd be a mistake.

42:47.106 --> 42:48.399
Seth, confirm it.

42:48.774 --> 42:51.193
- That's right. Sixteen weeks.
- Her husband told me.

42:51.277 --> 42:53.946
But you don't know
how it's gonna play. Okay?

42:54.029 --> 42:56.240
It could backfire. Get her sympathy.

42:56.323 --> 43:01.603
- Who waits 16 weeks? - The narrative can't be controlled...
What kind of person, that's what people will be talking about.

43:01.662 --> 43:04.915
Let's get Mark on the phone.
We start this now.

43:13.882 --> 43:15.718
Only "Lisa" is what we called her.

43:16.719 --> 43:18.846
The lady at Central Market,
where she worked,

43:18.929 --> 43:22.016
said you stopped by
a few times asking for her.

43:22.099 --> 43:23.434
She owed us some money, but...

43:24.935 --> 43:25.936
She dead?

43:26.020 --> 43:27.062
Hmm. I don't know.

43:38.324 --> 43:39.658
There's not much in there.

43:40.576 --> 43:41.869
Some letters.

43:42.786 --> 43:44.872
Scraps and lists and...

43:46.999 --> 43:48.292
Picture.

43:49.793 --> 43:51.128
Nothing, really.

43:53.255 --> 43:55.299
<i>Our country has a problem right now.</i>

43:55.382 --> 43:56.550
<i>The president,</i>

43:56.634 --> 43:59.637
<i>she has ignored the advice
of her senior advisers,</i>

43:59.720 --> 44:02.431
<i>people who have studied
and fought battles.</i>

44:02.723 --> 44:05.225
<i>Her state of mind has left us
in a weakened...</i>

44:06.143 --> 44:08.604
<i>We need to hold the line</i>

44:08.854 --> 44:10.898
<i>till our country gets back on course.</i>

44:11.482 --> 44:13.692
That is a truly stunning video.

44:13.776 --> 44:16.779
What is your reaction
to the secretary of defense's critique

44:16.862 --> 44:17.863
of this president?

44:17.946 --> 44:21.158
Secretary Defense Hanna
is a four-star Marine General

44:21.241 --> 44:24.119
with over 40 years of service
to this country.

44:24.203 --> 44:26.580
I understand his frustration.

44:26.955 --> 44:30.292
Is there any truth to the idea
that Mark Usher

44:30.668 --> 44:32.795
is the Dick Cheney of this White House?

44:32.878 --> 44:34.755
No, there is only one Dick Cheney.

44:34.838 --> 44:36.191
- Okay, fair enough.
- Mark Usher is

44:36.215 --> 44:37.633
the Mark Usher of this White House.

44:37.716 --> 44:39.009
So, how would you characterize

44:39.093 --> 44:41.845
- the vice president's role?
- The vice president

44:41.929 --> 44:44.473
<i>has the full support
of the entire cabinet.</i>

44:44.556 --> 44:45.641
<i>And the president?</i>

44:45.933 --> 44:47.685
<i>Well, the president speaks for herself.</i>

44:47.935 --> 44:50.187
<i>Are you suggesting that
the secretary of defense</i>

44:50.270 --> 44:53.565
<i>is not the only one
who's frustrated with this president?</i>

44:53.649 --> 44:57.111
<i>You know, Lawrence, this town
feeds off of rumor and gossip</i>

44:57.194 --> 45:00.840
<i>- and it's counter-productive.</i>
- Raha? <i>It's a distraction. I don't work that way.</i>

45:00.864 --> 45:02.926
<i>You don't work that way.
How do you work?</i>

45:02.950 --> 45:05.494
<i>- How do you work with this president?</i>
- You have a call.

45:06.161 --> 45:07.287
It's your president.

45:07.371 --> 45:09.456
<i>Is this a dysfunctional administration?</i>

45:09.540 --> 45:11.140
<i>My relationship with this...</i>

45:12.418 --> 45:13.418
<i>Claire.</i>

45:13.669 --> 45:18.382
Jane, I just need to know exactly
when they're going to pull the trigger.

45:26.932 --> 45:28.600
<i>Don't you want to come home?</i>

45:32.146 --> 45:34.356
You look like you're having fun.

45:36.775 --> 45:38.569
I see real affection there.

45:40.154 --> 45:42.865
And, listen, there were rumors
about Tom and me, of course,

45:42.948 --> 45:44.616
but nothing to them.

45:45.117 --> 45:46.535
He was like a brother to me.

45:46.618 --> 45:48.120
So comforting.

45:50.539 --> 45:53.542
Which is what makes this
all the more difficult.

45:55.627 --> 45:57.087
The truth is, Kelsey...

45:58.547 --> 45:59.757
the Russians killed Tom...

46:01.341 --> 46:02.843
and Mark Usher covered it up.

46:03.594 --> 46:06.013
Now, I'm doing my best
to hold him accountable,

46:06.096 --> 46:07.181
but I need your help.

46:09.016 --> 46:11.935
I need you to tell the FBI

46:12.019 --> 46:13.562
about your relationship with Tom.

46:13.645 --> 46:15.647
- Madam President, I...
- I know. It's fine.

46:15.731 --> 46:18.150
You just say you were dating.

46:19.026 --> 46:20.194
You were in love.

46:20.861 --> 46:22.488
And in a private moment,

46:23.614 --> 46:26.742
he told you about
his suspicions regarding

46:27.618 --> 46:29.787
Mark Usher and his collusion with Russia.

46:31.538 --> 46:32.998
And the last time you saw him,

46:33.081 --> 46:35.083
he was on his way
to the vice president's home

46:35.167 --> 46:36.168
to confront him.

46:39.213 --> 46:41.799
I'm not going to let the vice president
get away with this.

46:43.717 --> 46:45.469
You and I, as women,

46:47.012 --> 46:48.972
we have to fight back.
I need you by my side.

46:58.816 --> 47:00.901
And before we transmit the letter,

47:01.610 --> 47:04.696
I'd like to suggest we all take a moment
to bow our heads

47:05.322 --> 47:07.199
and pray for this great nation.

47:28.846 --> 47:30.264
Could you pass me that letter?

47:47.739 --> 47:49.449
And gather all of your things.

47:49.867 --> 47:52.494
Every single cabinet member in this room

47:52.578 --> 47:53.745
is dismissed.

47:54.329 --> 47:55.329
You're all fired.

47:57.249 --> 47:58.542
Escort them out.

48:06.550 --> 48:07.551
You know,

48:08.051 --> 48:12.014
I never took you for someone
who wanted to get himself into the Oval.

48:12.431 --> 48:16.018
All it is, is a four year job,
eight if you're lucky.

48:18.145 --> 48:19.521
Hey, where are you?

48:20.898 --> 48:21.898
What?

48:23.483 --> 48:24.943
All right. I'm on my way back.

48:26.236 --> 48:28.780
<i>Listen, if she prevented the signing,
that's obstruction.</i>

48:28.864 --> 48:30.741
<i>And likely, it's impeachable.</i>

48:30.824 --> 48:31.824
<i>You hear me?</i>

48:32.492 --> 48:34.172
<i>Details are still coming in.</i>

48:34.202 --> 48:37.372
<i>But we're being told there are reports
that the FBI...</i>

48:37.456 --> 48:39.625
- Mark.
<i>- ...has today been provided evidence...</i>

48:39.708 --> 48:41.811
- Get to a television.
<i>- ...that Mark Usher had quote...</i>

48:41.835 --> 48:44.004
- Or a computer.
<i>- ..."significant and ongoing...</i>

48:44.087 --> 48:45.380
Or a goddamn radio.

48:45.464 --> 48:48.508
<i>...contact outside the logs
with Russian officials."</i>

48:48.592 --> 48:50.969
<i>This leading up to
and during the president's</i>

48:51.053 --> 48:53.722
<i>recent polarizing Syrian peace deal.</i>

48:53.805 --> 48:56.183
<i>The FBI's expected
to look into the matter,</i>

48:56.266 --> 48:59.186
<i>but has yet to announce
whether or not they are opening</i>

48:59.269 --> 49:00.979
<i>an official investigation.</i>

49:01.063 --> 49:04.691
<i>If so, this could be
a catastrophic setback</i>

49:04.775 --> 49:07.277
<i>for an already-beleaguered administration.</i>

49:07.611 --> 49:12.074
Before we begin, I'd like
to offer youthe chance to resign.

49:17.120 --> 49:18.622
I'll leave you to it then.

49:22.459 --> 49:26.004
I never had any contact
with any Russians outside the logs. None.

49:26.088 --> 49:29.424
You vacationed at Deputy Foreign
Minister Zorkin's family dacha

49:29.508 --> 49:31.861
- on the Black Sea in summer 1991.
- That was 20 years ago.

49:31.885 --> 49:33.821
Let's work backwards,
start with questions that have arisen

49:33.845 --> 49:35.806
after Ms. Kelsey Stewart's deposition.

49:35.889 --> 49:36.889
Who?

49:38.266 --> 49:41.478
We located her phone
in a liquor store in Bellport.

49:41.561 --> 49:43.063
She knows about the app.

49:43.730 --> 49:45.315
We should assume so.

49:45.565 --> 49:47.109
Have you told my uncle yet?

49:47.192 --> 49:49.027
I can't reach him.

49:49.111 --> 49:50.779
I can't reach your mother, either.

49:50.862 --> 49:52.502
We have some men tracking the journalist.

49:52.531 --> 49:54.992
But we don't even know
if she has her hands on anything yet.

49:56.118 --> 49:58.745
- Package for Mr. Shepherd.
- Oh, thank you.

50:02.207 --> 50:03.792
This is addressed to you.

50:15.053 --> 50:16.555
Leave me alone, please.

50:28.817 --> 50:30.861
<i>My name is Catherine Durant.</i>

50:31.194 --> 50:35.073
<i>Today is Tuesday, July 18, 2017.</i>

50:35.907 --> 50:38.035
<i>And the time...</i>

50:38.118 --> 50:39.995
<i>is 8:37 p.m.</i>

50:40.912 --> 50:43.623
<i>Now, before I begin, let me just say...</i>

50:45.000 --> 50:47.085
<i>that every punishment</i>

50:47.419 --> 50:51.715
<i>that history will surely visit
upon Claire Underwood</i>

50:52.466 --> 50:55.302
<i>will be exactly what she deserves.</i>

50:55.385 --> 50:59.723
<i>I rue the day that I accepted
her husband's offer</i>

50:59.806 --> 51:01.767
<i>of secretary of state.</i>

51:02.225 --> 51:03.351
<i>Now, then...</i>

51:04.519 --> 51:08.273
<i>I hereby swear that everything
I'm about to say</i>

51:08.356 --> 51:09.357
<i>is the truth.</i>

51:10.734 --> 51:13.570
Her husband has disappeared,
as of six hours ago.

51:14.029 --> 51:16.198
- Do you want to hear any more?
- No.

51:16.281 --> 51:17.282
I know the rest.

51:20.535 --> 51:22.204
Do you think the Russians got them out?

51:23.038 --> 51:25.540
Uh, no, I'm sure of it.

51:26.625 --> 51:28.752
Do you think she sent it to anyone else?

51:28.835 --> 51:30.504
We would know about it by now.

51:31.046 --> 51:33.507
I've asked Nathan to be available to you.

51:34.091 --> 51:36.510
I know how well you two work
with one another.

51:37.427 --> 51:38.595
We'll find her.

51:40.639 --> 51:43.809
And, Doug, I haven't forgotten about
the promise we made to each other.

51:44.059 --> 51:45.268
I hope you haven't.

52:19.553 --> 52:21.471
<i>I just got back from New Mexico.</i>

52:21.930 --> 52:24.307
<i>What did you do with Rachel?
Or is it Cassie?</i>

52:26.726 --> 52:28.103
I'm five minutes away.

52:28.186 --> 52:29.521
<i>Hang up the phone.</i>

52:29.604 --> 52:30.897
- Doug...
<i>- Hang it up</i>

52:30.981 --> 52:32.482
<i>or you'll never hear from me again.</i>

52:33.316 --> 52:34.568
<i>I'll come to you.</i>

52:47.164 --> 52:48.164
Nathan,

52:48.748 --> 52:50.125
<i>are you still listening?</i>

52:52.127 --> 52:54.254
<i>You're a fool to think she'll protect you.</i>

53:03.346 --> 53:05.515
Seems fitting, somehow,

53:05.599 --> 53:09.561
that you're the first person I meet with
after I've returned to work.

53:10.645 --> 53:12.814
There's something
very full circle about it.

53:13.648 --> 53:15.775
So, you've talked to your son.

53:15.859 --> 53:18.528
Or rather, not your son.

53:19.571 --> 53:22.657
Do you know how developed
a fetus is by then?

53:23.491 --> 53:25.118
Sixteen weeks is... beyond the beyond.

53:32.626 --> 53:34.836
That is what 16 weeks looks like.

53:34.920 --> 53:37.422
That is what I can't get out of my head.

53:38.006 --> 53:40.675
I'm quoting Melody Cruz here, by the way.

53:40.759 --> 53:43.470
She just taped her segment,
due to run tomorrow.

53:44.179 --> 53:45.597
Visual aids and everything.

53:47.140 --> 53:49.893
For the first time ever,
Americans will hear the story

53:49.976 --> 53:51.061
of a childless president...

53:52.395 --> 53:53.647
who had an abortion,

53:54.231 --> 53:55.440
while married,

53:55.941 --> 53:57.859
at 16 weeks.

53:58.735 --> 54:00.737
I wanted to see your face.

54:00.820 --> 54:03.573
I wanted to see Frank's betrayal register.

54:03.949 --> 54:06.952
Nobody can keep
their mouths shut these days.

54:07.285 --> 54:09.329
Not even to-the-death secrets are safe.

54:09.412 --> 54:10.580
It's shameful.

54:11.957 --> 54:13.792
But honestly, what's worse?

54:14.125 --> 54:15.877
That he betrayed your secret

54:15.961 --> 54:18.338
or that you waited until 16 weeks?

54:18.421 --> 54:19.839
You and your party.

54:20.423 --> 54:23.301
Your moral rectitude, how convenient.

54:23.385 --> 54:26.012
You don't even believe half
of what you say, Annette.

54:26.680 --> 54:27.680
Run it.

54:28.014 --> 54:29.266
Cruz's piece.

54:29.724 --> 54:30.767
Run it.

54:31.810 --> 54:33.645
And then go home

54:34.020 --> 54:36.648
and talk to Duncan
about the beginning of life.

54:38.233 --> 54:39.943
But actually before you go,

54:40.026 --> 54:42.362
I want to show you something.
Come with me.

54:59.587 --> 55:01.464
Meet my new cabinet.

55:04.801 --> 55:06.761
I just wanted to see your face.

55:16.730 --> 55:20.108
Thank you all for assembling
at such short notice.

55:21.234 --> 55:22.986
And I want to thank you

55:23.528 --> 55:25.530
for your willingness to serve.

55:26.823 --> 55:30.493
I am looking forward
to building a new America together

55:31.202 --> 55:33.663
and our work begins today.

55:35.248 --> 55:36.708
Now, if you could all

55:36.791 --> 55:39.419
place your left hand on the Constitution

55:39.502 --> 55:40.754
in front of you.

55:42.047 --> 55:43.715
And repeat after me:

55:43.798 --> 55:46.509
I do solemnly swear

55:47.305 --> 55:53.212
