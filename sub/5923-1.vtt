[birds chirping outside]

00:47.005 --> 00:50.930
[phone buzzing]

01:00.644 --> 01:01.941
RYAN:
Hey, Bradley!

01:02.229 --> 01:04.402
BRADLEY: Hey, you.
How did your workout go?

01:04.690 --> 01:07.694
RYAN: How did you
know I was working out?

01:07.985 --> 01:10.113
BRADLEY: You always
work out at this time.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.247
RYAN:
Stalker.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.203
Hey, I can't
really talk

01:14.491 --> 01:16.209
'cause I gotta go
meet my mom now.

01:16.493 --> 01:18.120
BRADLEY: Oh yeah?
Can I join you?

01:18.412 --> 01:19.459
RYAN:
Yeah, sure.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.874
Doesn't matter at all that
we haven't even met yet.

01:22.165 --> 01:24.259
BRADLEY: Then
let's meet already.

01:24.543 --> 01:26.216
RYAN : You 're
really far away.

01:26.503 --> 01:28.505
BRADLEY: 45 minutes
is not that far away.

01:28.797 --> 01:29.798
RYAN I

01:30.090 --> 01:31.307
Driving 100
miles an hour

01:31.592 --> 01:34.095
you still couldn't get
here in 45 minutes.

01:34.386 --> 01:36.229
BRADLEY: No...

01:37.472 --> 01:40.476
RYAN: Besides, what happened
to that guy you went out with?

01:40.767 --> 01:43.111
BRADLEY: It was
just one date.

01:43.395 --> 01:47.195
RYAN: And follow up?
BRADLEY: None.

01:48.442 --> 01:49.614
RYAN:
Oh, okay.

01:49.901 --> 01:52.745
BRADLEY: Look,
you know I like you.

01:53.030 --> 01:55.874
Go on a date with me.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.126
RYAN: Well, what if I
come all the way there,

01:58.410 --> 02:00.412
you see me and
I'm not your type

02:00.704 --> 02:02.422
and I don't even
get a second date?

02:02.706 --> 02:05.960
BRADLEY: You know
that will never happen.

02:06.501 --> 02:08.424
[door opens]

02:10.839 --> 02:12.762
[door closes]

02:21.975 --> 02:23.898
[keys jingle]

02:32.402 --> 02:35.155
RYAN: Hey, Mom.
CINDY: Hey, Sweetie.

02:35.447 --> 02:37.666
CINDY: How are you?
RYAN: What's this?

02:37.949 --> 02:41.579
CINDY: I brought
a little work home.

02:41.870 --> 02:43.622
RYAN: Why are you still
working such long hours?

02:43.914 --> 02:46.383
Isn't Dad's
insurance enough?

02:46.667 --> 02:47.589
CINDY:
It's okay,

02:47.876 --> 02:51.301
I save his insurance
for you to buy a house.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.215
RYAN: That's
still a ways away.

02:53.507 --> 02:54.633
Cl N DY:
A ways away?

02:54.925 --> 02:56.142
Just find a girl,

02:56.426 --> 02:59.225
get married
and buy a house.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.232
RYAN: You make
it sound so easy.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.894
CINDY: Aren't there some
nice girls after you in school?

03:05.185 --> 03:07.688
RYAN: [chuckles]
No, no, there are not.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.940
CINDY: Did you
find someone already?

03:10.232 --> 03:11.199
RYAN: No.
Now watch your head

03:11.483 --> 03:13.326
CINDY:
Oh.

03:20.534 --> 03:24.255
RYAN: [chuckles]
I love green tea ice cream.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.211
CINDY: Good. Here,
green tea cookies.

03:26.498 --> 03:28.341
RYAN: Really?

03:34.214 --> 03:35.466
Mom, that's
peanut butter.

03:35.757 --> 03:37.600
[Cindy laughs]

03:39.469 --> 03:41.187
RYAN: Bye, mom.
CINDY: God bless.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.314
Study hard.

03:46.852 --> 03:48.775
[locks door]

03:49.563 --> 03:53.909
RYAN: So my top choices
are Princeton, Yale and UCLA.

03:54.192 --> 03:56.615
CRAIG: Those are very
difficult PhD programs, Ryan.

03:56.903 --> 03:57.995
You're gonna need

03:58.280 --> 04:00.453
a very impressive Master's
Thesis to get accepted,

04:00.741 --> 04:02.493
So what do you have to
impress me with today?

04:02.784 --> 04:04.206
RYAN :
Okay.

04:04.494 --> 04:08.169
So, love and desire
are advantageous traits

04:08.457 --> 04:11.131
that our Creator
has given us,

04:11.418 --> 04:13.546
regardless of whether one
subscribes to creationism

04:13.837 --> 04:15.635
or theistic evolution.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.423
CRAIG: So you're
sticking with the argument

04:17.716 --> 04:20.185
that love and desire
have assisted our species

04:20.469 --> 04:21.721
through the evolutionary
process?

04:22.012 --> 04:24.686
RYAN: Yes.
CRAIG: Okay, go on.

04:24.973 --> 04:28.398
RYAN: Okay, so love and
desire encourages procreation,

04:28.685 --> 04:30.858
protection
and socialization

04:31.104 --> 04:32.606
which enable us
to better survive

04:32.898 --> 04:36.277
and hence persist
as a species.

04:36.568 --> 04:39.242
CRAIG: That's all good,
but what about the theology?

04:39.529 --> 04:41.327
RYAN: I was just
about to get to that.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.413
CRAIG:
Okay.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.418
RYAN: I intend to fuse
the reformed approach

04:45.702 --> 04:46.578
with the trinitarian
approach.

04:46.870 --> 04:48.247
CRAIG:
How so?

04:48.538 --> 04:51.337
RYAN: Well, our God
is a good God.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.298
Who creates good things.

04:53.585 --> 04:55.007
God created us
to love each other

04:55.295 --> 04:58.265
so that we would
reflect God's love for us,

04:58.548 --> 05:01.267
our love for God,
and ultimately,

05:01.551 --> 05:03.349
the love that is
mutually inherent

05:03.637 --> 05:05.560
in a trinitarian
God head.

05:05.847 --> 05:09.272
Therefore, God gave us
love so that on earth,

05:09.559 --> 05:13.359
there is an action
that reflects the divine.

06:41.693 --> 06:44.617
KEVIN: You wanna
go to my place?

06:45.572 --> 06:48.371
RYAN: I do.
I really do.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.376
But...

06:50.660 --> 06:53.504
I'm not just
looking for a hook-up.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.591
KEVIN: What are
you looking for?

06:56.875 --> 06:59.503
RYAN: I'm looking
for a relationship.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.297
For someone to date.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.591
KEVIN: I want you
to date me tonight.

07:04.883 --> 07:07.727
RYAN: Tonight?
KEVIN: Yeah, tonight.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.482
RYAN: Do you
have a boyfriend?

07:13.767 --> 07:15.565
Oh shit, I should
have asked this sooner.

07:15.852 --> 07:20.198
KEVIN: No, I do not
have a boyfriend.

07:20.482 --> 07:24.328
RYAN: When was the
last time you had one?

07:26.154 --> 07:28.532
KEVIN: It was
about six years ago.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.416
RYAN:
Six years?

07:30.700 --> 07:33.453
KEVIN:
Yeah, six years.

07:33.745 --> 07:35.122
RYAN :
Wow.

07:35.413 --> 07:39.509
Well, have you been, like,
looking for a new boyfriend?

07:40.794 --> 07:42.717
KEVIN:
No.

07:44.047 --> 07:45.970
RYAN:
Why not?

07:46.466 --> 07:48.639
KEVIN: You sure ask
a lot of questions.

07:48.927 --> 07:51.601
RYAN: Sorry.
[chuckles]

07:51.888 --> 07:53.481
Look...

07:54.307 --> 07:56.275
After my last breakup...

07:56.559 --> 08:00.359
You know, it really tore
me up, it really hurt.

08:01.898 --> 08:05.448
So then I just figured,
no more.

08:10.573 --> 08:14.498
RYAN: So you're
content without love?

08:16.329 --> 08:19.253
KEVIN:
Without love?

08:21.126 --> 08:22.503
Who's to really say

08:22.794 --> 08:26.924
that love only exists in
long-term relationships?

08:27.215 --> 08:30.059
RYAN:
I don't know...

08:32.511 --> 08:37.985
But I need to be in a
relationship to feel loved.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.525
KEVIN:
Really?

08:41.813 --> 08:43.655
[indistinct]

08:47.485 --> 08:50.409
How do you feel now,
beautiful?

08:57.203 --> 08:58.204
GERALD:
Hey, Ryan.

08:58.496 --> 08:59.622
RYAN:
Hey Gerald,

08:59.914 --> 09:02.508
what are you
doing right now?

09:02.792 --> 09:05.170
GERALD: Going to class.
RYAN: Oh.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.214
Okay, you know,
I'll talk to you later.

09:07.505 --> 09:10.349
GERALD: Sure thing.
RYAN: All right.

09:19.934 --> 09:21.732
ANTHONY: Look what
Eugene is putting up.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.897
RYAN:
Well, it figures.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.907
ANTHONY: And you
call him your friend?

09:26.191 --> 09:27.568
KELLI:
Hi, guys.

09:27.859 --> 09:30.282
RYAN: Hey, Kelli.
KELLI: How are you?

09:30.570 --> 09:32.993
RYAN: Good.
EUGENE: What's going on?

09:33.281 --> 09:35.204
RYAN:
The usual.

09:35.492 --> 09:36.664
EUGENE: Usual?
That's boring.

09:36.951 --> 09:38.828
RYAN:
You're boring.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.043
EUGENE: Ryan,
you know what?

09:41.331 --> 09:44.175
KELLI: You guys
are both boring.

09:46.044 --> 09:47.591
ANTHONY: I'm going
to get some food.

09:47.879 --> 09:49.381
EUGENE: That's a good idea!
I'm starving

09:49.672 --> 09:51.515
RYAN:
Me too.

09:54.844 --> 09:55.811
KELLI: We're heading
to the bookstore.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.268
You guys wanna come?

09:57.555 --> 09:59.978
RYAN: Nah, I think I will
get some studying done here.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.769
EUGENE: Are you
sure about that?

10:03.061 --> 10:05.860
Angela is working today.

10:06.689 --> 10:07.690
RYAN:
So?

10:07.982 --> 10:10.826
EUGENE: So?
She's hot!

10:11.653 --> 10:13.621
KELLI:
Excuse me?

10:13.905 --> 10:16.749
EUGENE: Not as
hot as you, baby.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.328
KELLI: We gotta go.
Anthony?

10:20.620 --> 10:22.543
ANTHONY:
Um... No.

10:22.831 --> 10:24.299
I think I'm
gonna pass.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.334
KELLI: Okay, we'll
see you guys later.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.173
RYAN :
Bye.

10:36.511 --> 10:37.763
ANTHONY:
What?

10:38.054 --> 10:39.647
RYAN:
You hate Eugene.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.601
ANTHONY: Did you
see what he put up?

10:42.892 --> 10:45.395
RYAN: Yeah.
The sad thing is,

10:45.687 --> 10:47.655
my mom would probably
put up the same thing.

10:47.939 --> 10:49.737
ANTHONY:
That sucks.

10:50.024 --> 10:51.617
RYAN: [sighs]
Yeah.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.660
Hey, do you know
that guy, Kevin?

10:56.948 --> 10:59.167
ANTHONY: Kevin?
From Systematics?

10:59.450 --> 11:03.296
RYAN: Yeah, that's the one.
ANTHONY: Yeah, what about him?

11:05.081 --> 11:07.675
RYAN:
We hooked up.

11:08.209 --> 11:10.132
ANTHONY:
Good for you.

11:11.629 --> 11:14.553
RYAN: No, actually,
it wasn't.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.642
ANTHONY:
Why?

11:16.926 --> 11:19.725
RYAN: [sighs]
I don't know.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.686
I mean, the
sex was great.

11:21.973 --> 11:25.978
But immediately afterwards,
as I was driving home,

11:26.269 --> 11:29.819
I just...
I felt so...

11:31.649 --> 11:33.196
Empty.

11:33.484 --> 11:37.330
Like, there is
this loneliness...

11:38.990 --> 11:43.666
Like, a huge void in
me that won't go away.

11:44.996 --> 11:48.921
Even for a moment with,
like, a hook-up.

11:50.752 --> 11:52.754
ANTHONY:[sighs]
Oh yeah, that's a bummer.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.890
Hey, I gotta go.

11:58.092 --> 11:59.719
RYAN:
Okay, what's wrong?

12:00.011 --> 12:01.854
ANTHONY:
I'm tired, Ryan.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.600
RYAN: Yeah, but you
are one of two friends

12:05.892 --> 12:08.520
I can talk to
about that stuff.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.108
ANTHONY:
"That stuff?"

12:10.396 --> 12:11.818
[laughter]

12:12.106 --> 12:13.949
RYAN :
Yes.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.070
ANTHONY: Well, I only
have you and Gerald

12:17.362 --> 12:19.831
to talk about
"that stuff" with too.

12:20.114 --> 12:22.833
And I don't force
you to listen to me.

12:23.117 --> 12:25.666
RYAN: Well, yeah. But at
least you're out to your mom.

12:25.954 --> 12:26.921
ANTHONY:
So?

12:27.205 --> 12:28.832
RYAN: Well, don't
you talk to her?

12:29.123 --> 12:31.842
ANTHONY:
About "that stuff"?

12:32.126 --> 12:33.753
No!

12:34.045 --> 12:36.969
RYAN: I thought you said
your mom is supportive.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.304
ANTHONY: She
is supportive,

12:38.591 --> 12:41.515
but I don't like to talk
to her about "that stuff".

12:41.803 --> 12:44.477
RYAN: I'd kill to talk to
my morn about "that stuff".

12:44.764 --> 12:46.812
ANTHONY: Well, let me
know when that happens.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.773
I gotta go,

12:49.060 --> 12:50.437
RYAN:
Wait, Anthony.

12:50.728 --> 12:52.730
Can't you just hang
for a little bit?

12:53.022 --> 12:55.946
ANTHONY: Ryan,
you are something.

12:56.234 --> 12:57.736
RYAN: What? What do
you mean by that?

12:58.027 --> 13:00.450
ANTHONY: Can't
you just let me go?

13:00.738 --> 13:02.285
RYAN: Anthony,
I wanna know

13:02.573 --> 13:07.249
why you're acting
so weird today.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.460
ANTHONY: Because
I just broke up.

13:09.747 --> 13:11.715
RYAN: With Dat?
ANTHONY: No, my mom.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.843
Yes, Dat.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.504
RYAN: Why didn't you
say something earlier?

13:16.796 --> 13:18.764
ANTHONY: Because I don't
want to think about it

13:19.048 --> 13:20.800
or even talk
about "that stuff".

13:21.092 --> 13:22.935
[sighs]

13:23.261 --> 13:27.186
RYAN: I'm sorry.
What happened?

13:29.684 --> 13:32.187
ANTHONY: He only
calls when he needs me.

13:32.478 --> 13:35.903
He only comes by
when he feels like it.

13:36.190 --> 13:39.660
I can't take it anymore.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.413
RYAN: Anthony,
I'm so sorry.

13:42.697 --> 13:48.921
ANTHONY: You know,
I'm just tired and sick of it.

13:49.203 --> 13:51.672
RYAN:
He's such an ass.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.800
ANTHONY: He's not an ass,
he's just selfish.

Hey, Bradley.

me interrupting your reading.

RYAN: You're so crazy.
BRADLEY: How are you?

14:54.352 --> 14:58.573
RYAN: I'm a little
stressed about my thesis.

14:58.856 --> 15:01.530
I need to make it
great to get into Yale.

15:01.818 --> 15:05.743
According to my professor.
And probably according to Yale.

sure you're gonna do awesome.

Okay.

Anthony is letting himself

15:37.395 --> 15:38.942
be treated
this way.

15:39.230 --> 15:40.903
I want to talk to Dat.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.863
BRADLEY:
You do? Why?

15:43.151 --> 15:45.654
RYAN: Because I can't stand
the way his treating Anthony.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.414
I'm gonna give him
a piece of my mind.

of you manhandling Dat

to tell you something.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.064
DAT:
What?

18:27.565 --> 18:31.695
RYAN: Look, the way you
treated Anthony was not fair.

18:31.986 --> 18:38.210
And I'm only telling you this
because I consider you a friend.

18:38.492 --> 18:41.211
DAT: Ryan, that's
not your business.

18:41.495 --> 18:44.248
RYAN: Actually,
when you treat Anthony

18:44.540 --> 18:48.886
selfishly and cruelly,
it is my business.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.218
DAT:
You don't know shit.

18:51.505 --> 18:53.052
RYAN: Look, you
know what you did.

18:53.341 --> 18:57.187
And you need to
reflect on your actions.

that about me?

GERALD: Anthony is stressed.
Just let him be.

19:59.240 --> 20:02.210
RYAN: Seriously?
That's your advice?

20:02.493 --> 20:04.086

have to hang outwith me.

I've been working on my abs,
can you tell?

What do you think?

20:41.449 --> 20:42.826
GERALD:
Still too far?

20:43.117 --> 20:44.664
RYAN: Yeah, he's
like an hour away.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.625
GERALD: He's not
willing to drive up?

20:46.912 --> 20:48.334
RYAN:
No, he is.

20:48.622 --> 20:49.373
But if we're gonna date,

20:49.665 --> 20:52.168
I will have to drive
out there too.

20:52.460 --> 20:54.383
GERALD:
I guess that's true.

20:54.670 --> 20:56.638
RYAN: And he
wants to take me out.

20:56.922 --> 20:59.391
Like, pay for dinner,
and all that.

20:59.675 --> 21:03.396

I probably have to go out there.

never gonna see him, then.

31:57.332 --> 31:58.458
RYAN:
Perfect.

31:58.750 --> 32:01.879
We'll have a convention of
the closeted seminarians.

32:02.170 --> 32:04.013
ANTHONY: [laughs]
Exactly.

32:04.297 --> 32:05.549
I'll arrange that.

32:05.841 --> 32:09.266
RYAN: Would you? Just get
right on that, all right?

32:09.553 --> 32:11.351
ANTHONY: Hey, I gotta go.
Talk to you later.

32:11.638 --> 32:13.185
RYAN: Oh, okay.
Bye.

32:13.473 --> 32:15.316
ANTHONY:
Okay, bye.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.941
GERALD:
Hey, Ryan!

33:04.232 --> 33:06.701
RYAN: Hey, Gerald.
GERALD: How are you today?

33:06.985 --> 33:08.578
RYAN: Not so
great actually.

33:08.862 --> 33:10.705
GERALD:
Why?

33:12.782 --> 33:14.079
What's up?

33:14.367 --> 33:15.789
RYAN: Well, it's been two
days and Bradley hasn't called.

33:16.077 --> 33:18.330
GERALD: Really?
RYAN: Yeah.

33:18.622 --> 33:22.877
I thought the date went well,
maybe I was wrong.

33:23.168 --> 33:26.388
GERALD: It's better
to know it early.

33:26.671 --> 33:28.514
RYAN:
I guess.

33:28.798 --> 33:31.642

BRADLEY: Hello.
RYAN: Hi.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.048
BRADLEY: How are you?
CINDY: Dinner is ready!

35:29.336 --> 35:32.215
RYAN: I'm well.
I'm at my mom's.

35:32.505 --> 35:34.257
BRADLEY: Was that her?
RYAN: Yeah.

35:34.549 --> 35:36.142
BRADLEY: I should
let you go then.

35:36.426 --> 35:38.303
RYAN: Okay, but I'm
gonna go back tonight.

35:38.595 --> 35:40.063
So can I call
you later?

35:40.347 --> 35:42.190
BRADLEY: Yeah.
RYAN: Cool.

35:43.350 --> 35:45.273
Bye.

35:46.728 --> 35:48.571
CINDY:
You look happy.

35:48.855 --> 35:49.856
RYAN:
I do?

35:50.148 --> 35:51.195
CINDY:
Yes, dear.

35:51.483 --> 35:54.111
Anything you
want to tell me?

35:54.402 --> 35:58.452
RYAN: No. Not
that I can think of.

35:58.740 --> 36:00.287
I wish I did have
something to tell you.

36:00.575 --> 36:02.418
CINDY:
Me too.

36:02.786 --> 36:04.880
RYAN:
Oh, there is something.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.962
CINDY: Yes?
RYAN: Tuition;s due next week.

36:08.249 --> 36:09.876
CINDY:
I know that.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.011
RYAN:
Oh. All right.

36:12.837 --> 36:15.886
Well, thanks Mom.
I'll pay you back.

36:16.174 --> 36:19.144
CINDY: Don't you worry,
your dad left more than enough.

36:19.427 --> 36:21.805
RYAN: Mom, you
should use that to

36:22.097 --> 36:25.146
go on some vacation or
something around the world.

36:25.433 --> 36:26.355
CINDY: Oh,
speaking of your Dad,

36:26.643 --> 36:29.647
don't worry about his
anniversary, okay?

36:29.896 --> 36:31.739
RYAN:
Why not?

36:32.232 --> 36:35.156
J" Music J“

36:35.443 --> 36:37.116
CINDY: Concentrate
on your schoolwork.

36:37.404 --> 36:41.250
I'm busy myself,
so I don't think I'll go.

36:42.492 --> 36:45.166
RYAN: Mom.
are you sure?

36:46.454 --> 36:50.004
CINDY: Yeah, I'd rather not.
It brings back memories.

36:50.291 --> 36:53.295
J" Music J“

36:53.586 --> 36:55.179
RYAN :
Okay.

36:56.339 --> 37:00.264
CINDY: Oh, I had a dream
about you the other night.

37:01.344 --> 37:02.766
RYAN: Really?

37:03.054 --> 37:07.981
CINDY: I dreamt I was carrying
you like when you were a baby.

37:08.268 --> 37:10.111
RYAN:
Okay...

37:10.895 --> 37:13.865
CINDY: I told Aunt Annie,
and you know what she said?

37:14.149 --> 37:15.992
RYAN:
What?

37:17.777 --> 37:20.701
CINDY: She said I'm
still carrying you.

37:25.660 --> 37:27.583

FEMALE VOICE: The
mail box belonging to...

38:24.803 --> 38:27.226
BRADLEY: Bradley Myers...
FEMALE VOICE: is full

39:37.542 --> 39:39.465
[sighs]

39:42.380 --> 39:45.304
[phone buzzing]

39:47.510 --> 39:49.512
RYAN :
Hey.

39:49.804 --> 39:52.648
BRADLEY: Hey.
How are you?

39:53.933 --> 39:54.855
RYAN: Well...

39:56.519 --> 39:57.645
Other than the fact

39:57.937 --> 39:59.655
that you're not picking up
the phone when I call

39:59.939 --> 40:02.317
and it took you three
days to call me back...

40:02.609 --> 40:04.452
I'm okay.

40:06.571 --> 40:08.699
BRADLEY: I just
couldn't talk.

40:08.990 --> 40:10.833
RYAN:
Why not?

40:13.202 --> 40:15.125
BRADLEY:
I was crying.

40:16.539 --> 40:18.462
RYAN:
Crying?

40:19.542 --> 40:21.465
Why? What's
the matter?

40:22.086 --> 40:24.009
[Bradley sighs]

40:24.672 --> 40:27.721
BRADLEY: You're probably so
turned off by me right now.

40:28.009 --> 40:30.853
RYAN: What'? No!
Just...

40:31.679 --> 40:35.354
Just please tell
me What's going on.

40:39.729 --> 40:43.279
BRADLEY: I have a D.U.l.
court case tomorrow

40:43.691 --> 40:46.865
and my attorney
says he might be able

40:47.153 --> 40:49.997
to get the case
dismissed or extended.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.618
But I don't know.

40:54.744 --> 40:56.417
I don't know.

40:57.538 --> 40:59.711
RYAN:
A D.U.l.?

41:02.627 --> 41:04.550
BRADLEY: Yeah, driving
under the influence.

41:04.837 --> 41:09.434
RYAN: I know what a D.U.l.
is, but what happened?

41:15.264 --> 41:21.237
BRADLEY: I was leaving
a club. It was so stupid.

41:21.521 --> 41:23.319
[sighs]

41:24.649 --> 41:30.577
I sat in my car and tried
to sleep for like an hour.

41:31.656 --> 41:35.581
And I thought I'd be
totally fine to drive.

41:39.747 --> 41:42.421
I started driving home.

41:47.255 --> 41:49.257
Then there was lights...

41:53.761 --> 41:55.434
[sighs]

41:56.806 --> 41:58.479
And I got caught.

42:02.562 --> 42:04.439
RYAN:
Then what?

42:07.316 --> 42:10.240
BRADLEY: And then
I spent the night in jail.

42:13.072 --> 42:14.995
RYAN:
Aw, I'm sorry.

42:17.952 --> 42:21.877
How come you never
told me about this before?

42:22.165 --> 42:26.011
BRADLEY: Because guys with
D.U.l.s aren't that desirable.

42:26.794 --> 42:28.592
RYAN:
Don't be ridiculous.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.723
Are you okay?

42:31.049 --> 42:33.143
[Bradley sobbing]

42:33.426 --> 42:35.269
BRADLEY:
I'm depressed.

42:35.845 --> 42:37.518
RYAN:
Depressed?

42:43.853 --> 42:47.483
BRADLEY: I've been
on medication for it.

42:48.816 --> 42:51.660
RYAN: Okay. So are
you seeing a therapist?

42:52.695 --> 42:55.665
BRADLEY: No.
A doctor.

42:59.368 --> 43:02.292
RYAN: Don't you
wanna see a therapist?

43:04.499 --> 43:07.252
BRADLEY: Therapists
cost a lot of money.

43:07.543 --> 43:11.389
I'm not sure I have the
money for that now.

43:14.842 --> 43:16.765
RYAN:
Bradley...

43:18.721 --> 43:21.270
Do you Pray?

43:23.768 --> 43:25.691
BRADLEY:
I used to.

43:26.771 --> 43:28.648
I don't anymore.

43:30.108 --> 43:32.031
RYAN:
But you used to?

43:35.154 --> 43:37.657
BRADLEY: I was
called a "faggot"

43:37.949 --> 43:40.543
and beaten up outside
the church parkinglot.

43:43.746 --> 43:45.669
RYAN:
I'm so sorry.

43:46.124 --> 43:49.594
BRADLEY: I just don't
go to church anymore.

43:49.877 --> 43:52.721
It's not because
of that, it's just--

43:53.631 --> 43:55.554
I don't know, I--

43:57.218 --> 43:59.061
RYAN: You know,
I understand,

43:59.345 --> 44:03.145
I mean, I can't even
be out in seminary.

44:03.474 --> 44:05.397
BRADLEY:
You-- Why?

44:06.227 --> 44:08.150
Everybody loves you.

44:09.897 --> 44:11.570
RYAN:
That's sweet, but--

44:12.984 --> 44:15.908
Most of those people
don't know the Whole me.

44:16.821 --> 44:19.700
[Bradley sobs]

44:19.991 --> 44:22.244
RYAN: What? What did I say?
What's the matter?

44:22.535 --> 44:24.378
Are you okay?

44:25.663 --> 44:28.587
BRADLEY:
If I lose this case...

44:29.917 --> 44:34.844
I might lose my job and I
won't be able to pay for rent.

44:35.923 --> 44:37.641
I'll lose my car

44:37.925 --> 44:41.771
My life as we
know will be over.

44:43.598 --> 44:45.600
RYAN: It won't
be over. I--

44:45.892 --> 44:49.772
I'm here, and I can do
everything I can to help.

44:50.062 --> 44:52.190
BRADLEY: Or you
could just move on.

44:52.481 --> 44:54.324
RYAN:
What?

44:55.443 --> 44:56.820
Move on'?

44:57.111 --> 44:59.955
I'm not moving on.

45:01.532 --> 45:03.455
Unless I--

45:04.744 --> 45:06.337
Are you?

45:06.621 --> 45:08.464
BRADLEY:
No. No!

45:15.838 --> 45:19.763
RYAN: Bradley, are you
chatting online with other guys?

45:20.593 --> 45:22.516
BRADLEY:
No.

45:23.262 --> 45:27.187
RYAN: I don't mean now.
I just mean, in general.

45:31.812 --> 45:33.689
BRADLEY:
Yeah.

45:36.776 --> 45:39.700
RYAN: And do you
webcam with them too?

45:42.907 --> 45:44.830
BRADLEY:
Sometimes.

45:45.117 --> 45:46.664
It's just an escape.

45:47.536 --> 45:52.463
It's the only time I can
forget about my problems.

45:54.168 --> 45:56.842
RYAN: Are there any
that you're interested in?

45:57.797 --> 45:58.673
BRADLEY:
Of course not.

45:58.965 --> 46:01.764
No.
Isn't that obvious?

46:03.427 --> 46:05.350
RYAN:
Isn't what obvious?

46:05.846 --> 46:08.645
BRADLEY:
I'm crazy about you.

46:08.933 --> 46:11.402
RYAN: I'm crazy
about you too.

46:11.686 --> 46:13.529
I miss you.

46:14.981 --> 46:17.655
BRADLEY:
I miss you so much.

46:17.942 --> 46:20.786
RYAN: When are you
coming to see me?

46:22.238 --> 46:25.708
BRADLEY: What are
you doing Friday?

46:25.992 --> 46:27.835
RYAN:
Valentine's Day?

46:28.577 --> 46:32.502
BRADLEY: Oh, we could
meet another day then.

46:33.040 --> 46:35.714
RYAN:
No, let's do it then.

46:37.878 --> 46:39.880
BRADLEY:
Okay.

46:40.172 --> 46:41.765
Friday.

46:43.551 --> 46:45.474
RYAN:
Okay, great.

46:46.929 --> 46:48.772
Take care of yourself

46:49.056 --> 46:50.433
BRADLEY: All right.
Have a good night.

46:50.725 --> 46:52.022
RYAN:
You too.

46:59.400 --> 47:00.822
[closes laptop]

47:04.113 --> 47:06.036
[phone buzzing]

48:00.044 --> 48:01.341
KELLI:
I'm gonna go with

48:01.629 --> 48:03.802
the atonement theories
then, Professor Craig.

48:04.090 --> 48:05.307
CRAIG: That
sounds good, Kelli.

48:05.591 --> 48:06.763
KELLI: Hi, Ryan!
RYAN: Hey, Kelli.

48:07.051 --> 48:09.474
KELLI: I'll see you later, okay?
Bye, Professor.

48:09.762 --> 48:11.605
CRAIG:
Bye, Kelli.

48:13.057 --> 48:14.809
So how are you doing?

48:15.101 --> 48:16.944
RYAN:
I'm doing well.

48:17.395 --> 48:19.068
CRAIG: Well,
impress me.

48:19.355 --> 48:22.450
RYAN:Okay.
Well, simply put...

48:22.733 --> 48:23.905
Love hurts.

48:24.193 --> 48:26.036
It consumes us.

48:26.404 --> 48:30.329
But when it works,
it brings us immense joy.

48:32.827 --> 48:34.249
CRAIG:
And?

48:34.537 --> 48:36.210
RYAN:
And...

48:36.497 --> 48:41.378
Well, the thing is, it's so
difficult for it to work.

48:41.669 --> 48:46.891
If the purpose of love on earth
is to reflect God's love,

48:47.174 --> 48:53.022
but it causes so much suffering
and it's so difficult,

48:53.305 --> 48:55.899
then what does
that say about God?

48:56.809 --> 48:58.857
Why does God
give us love

48:59.145 --> 49:02.069
so that we can
reflect God's love

49:02.356 --> 49:06.202
if it's only to
suffer in the process?

49:07.153 --> 49:08.996
CRAIG:
Go on.

49:09.280 --> 49:11.282
RYAN: Okay.
So my goal is

49:11.574 --> 49:15.420
to remove the purpose of
reflecting God from love.

49:16.245 --> 49:18.088
I want to say
that to love without

49:18.372 --> 49:21.000
a teleological structure
of understanding love

49:21.292 --> 49:22.885
is still enough.

49:23.169 --> 49:27.015
When we love each other
we already love God.

49:28.215 --> 49:29.262
CRAIG:
Really?

49:29.550 --> 49:31.302
RYAN:
Yes, Professor.

49:31.594 --> 49:33.938
Even if a person
does not follow Christ,

49:34.221 --> 49:38.067
if he or she loves,
he or she reflects Christ.

49:43.189 --> 49:44.907
RYAN: Oh hey, Lorree!
LORREE: Hi.

49:45.191 --> 49:47.159
Do you need flowers
for your dad?

49:47.443 --> 49:50.117
RYAN: Oh, no actually.
Not today.

49:51.197 --> 49:54.246
In fact, I have my first
date ever on Valentine's Day.

49:54.533 --> 49:56.160
LORREE:
Ooh, congratulations!

49:56.452 --> 49:58.045
RYAN:
Thanks.

49:58.329 --> 50:00.582
So I'm considering
getting flowers

50:00.873 --> 50:04.127
but do you guys jack up the
prices on Valentine's Day?

50:04.418 --> 50:06.466
LORREE: No, we don't.
RYAN: Oh, okay.

50:06.754 --> 50:08.472
Good.
[chuckles]

50:08.756 --> 50:10.975
Do you sell out,
or anything?

50:11.258 --> 50:12.430
LORREE: Well,
I would get here early.

50:12.718 --> 50:14.220
Just to be sure.

50:14.512 --> 50:17.356
RYAN: Thanks for the tip.
LORREE: No problem, sweetie.

50:18.098 --> 50:19.850
RYAN: Do you have any
plans on Valentine's Day?

50:20.142 --> 50:21.314
LORREE: No, I'll
just be working here.

50:21.602 --> 50:22.979
I don't have a date.

50:23.270 --> 50:24.897
RYAN: Oh.
LORREE: It's all good.

50:25.189 --> 50:26.657
I prefer it that way.

50:26.941 --> 50:28.784
RYAN:
Oh, okay.

50:38.661 --> 50:40.629
KEVIN:
Oh, boy.

50:40.913 --> 50:43.257
RYAN: Cruising again?
KEVIN: No.

50:43.541 --> 50:44.884
Are you?

50:45.167 --> 50:46.089
RYAN:
No.

50:46.377 --> 50:48.755
In fact, I'm actually
seeing someone.

50:49.046 --> 50:50.969
KEVIN: Oh, really?
RYAN: Mh-hm.

50:51.715 --> 50:56.095
Uh... Hey Kevin, you're in
the school of psychology, right?

50:56.387 --> 50:57.980
KEVIN:
Yeah.

50:58.264 --> 51:00.437
RYAN: All right.
Can I ask you a question?

51:00.724 --> 51:02.101
Her name is Rachel,

51:02.393 --> 51:04.942
I just texted
you her number.

51:05.229 --> 51:08.028
She'll see you
for half the cost.

51:09.316 --> 51:11.068
BRADLEY:
I'd rather die.

51:11.360 --> 51:12.953
RYAN:
What? Why?

51:13.696 --> 51:15.323
BRADLEY: My parents
sent me to a therapist

51:15.614 --> 51:16.831
when I came
out to them.

51:17.116 --> 51:20.120
RYAN: They did?
BRADLEY: Yeah.

51:21.453 --> 51:25.174
RYAN: Well, she's not
that kind of therapist.

51:25.457 --> 51:28.631
BRADLEY: I just
don't wanna go.

51:28.919 --> 51:30.466
I don't wanna bring up
all of the memories

51:30.754 --> 51:35.806
I'm trying
to forget.

51:36.093 --> 51:37.936
RYAN :
Okay.

51:40.931 --> 51:42.683
ANTHONY: Why don't you
just find someone else?

51:42.975 --> 51:45.069
RYAN: Like you
did with Dat?

51:45.352 --> 51:48.151
Oh Jeff, I'm so sorry,
I didn't--

51:49.315 --> 51:50.362
ANTHONY:
Jeff knows about Dat.

51:50.649 --> 51:51.992
JEFF:
It's okay,

51:52.276 --> 51:57.123
ANTHONY: So why don't you
just find someone else, Ryan?

51:58.115 --> 52:01.039
GERALD:
Gosh, this is spicy.

52:03.329 --> 52:05.582
ANTHONY: I'm so
sick of all those

52:05.873 --> 52:08.968
"protect the family"
flyers all over school.

52:09.251 --> 52:10.423
GERALD:
What did you expect?

52:10.711 --> 52:12.554
JEFF:
I'm curious...

52:12.921 --> 52:14.844
RYAN:
What about?

52:15.132 --> 52:17.009
JEFF: Well, you're
all studying theology,

52:17.301 --> 52:19.429
why this seminary
if it's anti-gay?

52:19.720 --> 52:21.188
ANTHONY: You
don't have agree with

52:21.472 --> 52:22.769
everything the seminary
subscribes to you.

52:23.057 --> 52:24.684
We came here to
explore our beliefs

52:24.975 --> 52:25.851
about various
theological topics.

52:26.143 --> 52:28.316
GERALD: Yeah,
especially about sex.

52:28.604 --> 52:30.026
ANTHONY:
What, virgin boy?

52:30.314 --> 52:31.736
GERALD:
Anyway, I like it.

52:32.024 --> 52:33.571
I consider myself
a liberal evangelical

52:33.859 --> 52:35.953
and this is one of the best
evangelical seminaries

52:36.236 --> 52:37.158
in the
world.

52:37.446 --> 52:39.665
RYAN: And I like it
because it reminds me to

52:39.948 --> 52:42.792
appreciate my
gay buddies.

52:43.285 --> 52:45.083
ANTHONY:
Dat's calling me again.

52:45.371 --> 52:46.293
RYAN: I thought
you guys are done?

52:46.580 --> 52:49.424
ANTHONY: We are.
We're just friends.

52:50.376 --> 52:52.253
RYAN: Are you sure you're
ready to be just friends?

52:52.544 --> 52:54.137
ANTHONY:
Yes.

52:55.089 --> 52:57.057
RYAN: Jeff's really nice.
ANTHONY: I know.

52:57.341 --> 52:59.184
He's so nice.

53:02.304 --> 53:04.147
RYAN: Feeling better?
GERALD: Much better.

53:04.431 --> 53:05.899
ANTHONY: And how about you,
how are you feeling?

53:06.183 --> 53:08.231
JEFF: I'm better, thanks.
ANTHONY: Good. Good.

53:09.061 --> 53:12.110
Okay, which one of you
guys wants to drive me

53:12.398 --> 53:14.446
to my dental surgery
on Monday?

53:14.733 --> 53:15.700
JEFF:
I told you I'll do it.

53:15.984 --> 53:17.736
ANTHONY: No, no, I don't
want you to miss work.

53:18.028 --> 53:19.029
RYAN: Well, what time
do you have to be there?

53:19.321 --> 53:20.368
ANTHONY:
10:00 in the morning.

53:20.656 --> 53:21.748
GERALD: I have class.
Can't you drive yourself?

53:22.032 --> 53:24.956
ANTHONY: No, I'm
gonna be sedated after.

53:25.244 --> 53:27.997
Besides, they want
me to have a driver.

53:28.288 --> 53:29.835
RYAN: I can do it.
I'll take you.

53:30.124 --> 53:31.967
ANTHONY:
Thanks, Ryan.

53:32.334 --> 53:34.257
[sighs]

53:35.713 --> 53:37.636
Are you okay?

53:37.965 --> 53:41.890
RYAN: Yes, I'm very well.
I'm more than okay.

53:53.355 --> 53:56.404
RYAN: What do you want?
EUGENE: What?

53:56.692 --> 53:59.866
RYAN:
Well, what's up?

54:00.154 --> 54:03.158
EUGENE: I'm going
to propose tonight.

54:03.449 --> 54:05.622
RYAN: On Valentine's Day?
EUGENE: Yeah, man.

54:05.909 --> 54:08.537
RYAN: That's original...
EUGENE: Well...

54:08.829 --> 54:12.675
It will make it easier to
remember our anniversary.

54:14.126 --> 54:16.800
RYAN: The anniversary
of your engagement?

54:17.087 --> 54:18.134
EUGENE: Yeah man,
well, I mean--

54:18.422 --> 54:20.424
I plan to marry on
Valentine's Day too.

54:20.716 --> 54:24.346
RYAN: [scoffs]
Isn't it a bit boring?

54:26.305 --> 54:27.306
EUGENE:
It is.

54:27.598 --> 54:28.474
But I killed two
birds with one stone.

54:28.766 --> 54:30.188
We celebrate
Valentine's Day

54:30.476 --> 54:32.399
and our anniversary
on the same day.

54:32.686 --> 54:33.858
It's awesome.

54:34.104 --> 54:36.948
RYAN: That's...
efficient.

54:37.524 --> 54:39.117
EUGENE:
Thanks, man!

54:39.401 --> 54:41.324

And boring.

54:41.612 --> 54:43.455
EUGENE:
Bitch.

54:43.989 --> 54:45.912
RYAN:
You love me.

54:46.992 --> 54:48.915
EUGENE:
I do. [chuckles]

54:51.288 --> 54:53.211
Wish me luck?

54:54.249 --> 54:55.296
RYAN:
Good luck...

54:55.584 --> 54:59.339
But you don't need it,
she's gonna say 'yes'.

54:59.630 --> 55:01.473
EUGENE:
I hope so.

55:03.926 --> 55:05.644
[chuckles]

55:05.928 --> 55:07.555
RYAN: I just got out
of my last class,

55:07.846 --> 55:09.223
and I'm going to take
a quick shower.

55:09.515 --> 55:11.108
Are you on your way?

55:11.391 --> 55:14.019
BRADLEY: I can't
leave my bed.

55:14.311 --> 55:16.234
RYAN: Are you
still depressed?

55:16.522 --> 55:21.494
BRADLEY: [sighs]
Yes.

55:21.777 --> 55:22.653
RYAN: Do you want
me to come there?

55:22.945 --> 55:25.698
BRADLEY: No, no,
don't come here.

55:26.365 --> 55:28.163
RYAN:
Why not?

55:28.450 --> 55:31.670
BRADLEY: 'Cause I don't
want you to see me like this.

55:31.954 --> 55:34.798
RYAN: It's okay.
BRADLEY: It's not okay.

55:36.959 --> 55:40.884
I'm so sorry,
but can we postpone?

55:43.173 --> 55:46.177
RYAN: When, though?
BRADLEY: Next week?

55:46.468 --> 55:48.311
Saturday?

55:49.680 --> 55:52.308
RYAN: I can't. I'm seeing
my morn on Saturday.

55:52.599 --> 55:54.818
BRADLEY: Right.
Friday, then?

55:56.436 --> 55:58.313
RYAN :
Okay.

55:59.231 --> 56:01.154
BRADLEY:
I'm sorry.

56:02.609 --> 56:04.532
RYAN:
That's all right.

56:04.862 --> 56:08.412
RYAN: I'll talk to you later.
BRADLEY: Okay.

56:10.576 --> 56:12.249

56:17.624 --> 56:20.218
GERALD: Are you sure he
isn't just stringing you along?

56:20.502 --> 56:22.345
RYAN:
I don't know.

56:23.422 --> 56:26.346
He claims that
he misses me.

56:26.884 --> 56:28.932
GERALD:
So?

56:29.219 --> 56:32.063
Actions speak
louder than words.

56:32.639 --> 56:34.312
RYAN:
I know.

56:37.519 --> 56:39.396
GERALD:
Do you love him?

56:41.523 --> 56:43.446
RYAN:
I don't know.

56:46.528 --> 56:48.451
I desire him.

56:52.534 --> 56:54.411
I Wish I didn't.

56:54.703 --> 56:57.547
I wish I had no desire.

57:08.258 --> 57:10.181
I miss his smell.

57:17.559 --> 57:22.235
Can you believe we chatted
for a year before meeting?

57:22.522 --> 57:24.490
And when we finally met,

57:24.775 --> 57:27.369
he was everything
I expected and more.

57:28.195 --> 57:30.539
It's as if he could
read my mind,

57:30.822 --> 57:33.666
tell how I
was feeling...

57:34.242 --> 57:38.167
And I've never known
anyone like that before.

57:40.582 --> 57:43.506
I think there is
something special there.

57:45.796 --> 57:48.720
GERALD: But he
keeps postponing.

57:50.175 --> 57:53.099
RYAN: I know.
I feel so stupid!

57:56.765 --> 57:59.689
GERALD: You are
far from stupid.

58:09.611 --> 58:12.706
RYAN: I just want
to be with him.

58:16.994 --> 58:19.918
RYAN: I'm sorry.
GERALD: It's okay.

58:21.581 --> 58:24.505
RYAN: Are you okay?
GERALD: Yeah.

58:25.210 --> 58:27.429
I'm tired. I think
I'm gonna go to bed.

58:27.713 --> 58:30.182
RYAN: Seriously?
GERALD: Yeah.

58:32.634 --> 58:34.557
RYAN:
What's wrong?

58:39.057 --> 58:41.981
GERALD: Let's just
change the topic.

58:43.812 --> 58:45.439
RYAN:
Why?

58:48.608 --> 58:50.406
RYAN: Are you okay?
GERALD: He is selfish.

58:50.694 --> 58:52.241
He's toying with you,
he's insincere.

58:52.529 --> 58:54.531
He sneaks around online,
doesn't fulfill his promises.

58:54.823 --> 58:56.416

Okay.

act like you don't know.

59:15.761 --> 59:17.479

Know what?

59:17.763 --> 59:19.640
[chuckles]

59:19.931 --> 59:23.356
GERALD: Do I need
to state the obvious?

59:23.643 --> 59:25.486
RYAN:
Yes! Please.

59:28.190 --> 59:30.864
GERALD: You like
to hear it, right?

59:31.151 --> 59:32.994
RYAN:
Hear what?

59:39.826 --> 59:41.749
GERALD:
I love you.

59:44.664 --> 59:45.540
RYAN:
You love me?

59:45.832 --> 59:49.632
GERALD: You know I do.
Don't deny it.

59:50.295 --> 59:54.220
[sighs] Feels good to
say it out loud, though.

01:00:00.806 --> 01:00:02.729
I've--

01:00:03.767 --> 01:00:05.690
I've always loved you.

Nothing to say'?

It's okay.

01:00:30.085 --> 01:00:31.632
I'm going to bed.

your way out please.

we just hung out.

guys have sex?

JEFF: Hey Anthony,
it's Jeff again. Um...

01:01:24.097 --> 01:01:25.519
I was just calling to
see how you're doing.

01:01:25.807 --> 01:01:28.481
And I hope that evrything
is going well, and--

01:01:28.768 --> 01:01:30.486
Just give me a call back
whenever you get this

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:31.441
so I'll know
you're okay.

01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:33.573

out of surgery soon.

Let's get you to bed.

01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:40.177
Okay, I gotta run
some errands.

01:02:40.465 --> 01:02:42.058
But I'm gonna pick some
food up for you, all right?

01:02:42.342 --> 01:02:43.093
ANTHONY:
Aw, thanks.

01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:45.228
RYAN: All right.
Sweet dreams.

01:02:47.806 --> 01:02:50.605
LORREE: Hi Ryan,
I didn't see you come in.

01:02:50.892 --> 01:02:52.690
Can I help you
with something?

01:02:52.978 --> 01:02:54.104
RYAN: Actually,
I'm just browsing.

01:02:54.396 --> 01:02:55.693
I might need something
for Saturday.

01:02:55.981 --> 01:02:58.450

just take your time.

your date like the flowers?

That's great.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:13.214
RYAN: Actually we're going
through a rough patch right now.

01:03:13.498 --> 01:03:15.466
LORREE: Oh, I'm
sorry to hear that.

01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:16.842
RYAN:
Yeah, it sucks.

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:18.970
LORREE: See, that's why
I stay out of relationships.

01:03:19.254 --> 01:03:20.847
They're too much trouble.

01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:22.678
RYAN:
Tell me about it.

01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:25.810
[phone buzzing]

01:03:26.928 --> 01:03:28.100
I'm sorry. Excuse me,
I have to take this.

01:03:28.388 --> 01:03:31.733
LORREE: Don't worry about it.
I'll see you later.

01:03:32.017 --> 01:03:34.190
RYAN: Hello.
JEFF: Hey Ryan, it's Jeff again.

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:35.603
RYAN: Hey, Jeff.
What's up?

01:03:35.895 --> 01:03:37.442
JEFF: I was wondering
how Anthony is doing,

01:03:37.731 --> 01:03:40.575
he hasn't been
answering his phone.

01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:44.870
ANTHONY:
Jeff is coming.

01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:46.748
RYAN: Oh good.
He'd been calling me.

01:03:47.032 --> 01:03:48.875
ANTHONY: Yeah.
I know.

01:03:50.035 --> 01:03:51.833
RYAN: So...

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:52.962
Are you gonna
tell him?

01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:55.089
ANTHONY:
Yes.

01:03:56.791 --> 01:03:58.259
RYAN: And then what,
ask him for forgiveness?

01:03:58.543 --> 01:04:00.386
ANTHONY:
Yeah. Of course.

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:01.762
RYAN :
Okay.

01:04:02.047 --> 01:04:03.890
[knocking on door]

01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:10.768
JEFF: Hey, Ryan.
RYAN: Hey, how are you doing?

01:04:11.056 --> 01:04:12.854
JEFF: Good.
RYAN: I was just on my way out.

01:04:13.141 --> 01:04:14.734
JEFF: Oh, you
don't have to leave.

01:04:15.018 --> 01:04:16.770
RYAN: Oh no, please.
I'm off the clock.

01:04:17.062 --> 01:04:18.029
It's your turn.

01:04:18.271 --> 01:04:19.864
JEFF: I'll walk you out.
I gotta smoke anyway.

01:04:20.148 --> 01:04:21.991
RYAN:
Oh okay.

01:04:22.901 --> 01:04:24.448
RYAN: Later, Anthony.
ANTHONY: Bye!

01:04:24.736 --> 01:04:28.582
JEFF: I'll see
you in a bit, honey.

01:04:30.116 --> 01:04:32.710
Sorry for bombarding
you with all those calls.

01:04:32.994 --> 01:04:34.166
RYAN: It was only
three calls, Jeff.

01:04:34.454 --> 01:04:35.876
JEFF:
Still.

01:04:36.164 --> 01:04:37.882
RYAN: Don't worry
about it, really.

01:04:38.166 --> 01:04:39.759
JEFF: Well,
thank you.

01:04:40.585 --> 01:04:43.509
RYAN: Seriously,
you can call me anytime.

01:04:44.089 --> 01:04:46.262
JEFF: Thanks. Sure you
don't wanna stay for a bit?

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:49.723
RYAN: Oh no, I can't. I really
gotta work on my thesis.

01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:51.854
JEFF:
Okay.

01:04:53.932 --> 01:04:55.775
See you later.
Thanks again.

01:04:56.059 --> 01:04:58.903
RYAN: No problem.
Bye, Jeff.

J" Music J“

01:05:35.473 --> 01:05:38.352
RYAN: How can love be a
gift be a gift from God

01:05:38.643 --> 01:05:40.816
when it causes
so much pain?

01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:42.731
CRAIG: That's just
a part of it, Ryan.

01:05:43.022 --> 01:05:46.026
You have to look
at it holistically.

01:05:46.317 --> 01:05:50.163
RYAN: Yeah, but when
you suffer from love,

01:05:51.156 --> 01:05:54.000
that's all you
can do at the time.

01:05:54.284 --> 01:05:56.127
CRAIG:
Right.

01:05:56.744 --> 01:06:00.794
RYAN: So how can it
be a gift from God?

01:06:01.082 --> 01:06:02.925
CRAIG:
You tell me.

01:06:04.752 --> 01:06:06.504
RYAN:
Well...

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:10.642
The only way I
can redeem love

01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:15.977
as a deliberate placement
by God to humanity

01:06:17.056 --> 01:06:19.980
is to use
the idea that

01:06:21.102 --> 01:06:25.983
the pain we suffer
is the same <i>as</i> God's.

01:06:26.274 --> 01:06:28.072
CRAIG:
Go on.

01:06:29.068 --> 01:06:30.991
RYAN:
Okay...

01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:36.001
Well, according to
Moltmann's "The Crucified God"

01:06:36.284 --> 01:06:40.960
he notes that God
yearns for our love.

01:06:42.499 --> 01:06:44.797
But we don't
always give it to him.

01:06:45.084 --> 01:06:47.928
And that is the
pain that God suffers.

01:06:49.214 --> 01:06:50.887
However...

01:06:51.758 --> 01:06:55.058
We will rectify
that with God, in time.

01:06:56.095 --> 01:07:02.023
But until then, it's the
pain of delayed parousia.

01:07:03.728 --> 01:07:06.481
CRAIG: So you want to
justify our suffering

01:07:06.773 --> 01:07:09.617
with God's
suffering?

01:07:10.485 --> 01:07:13.409
RYAN: Yeah.
I hope to.

01:07:14.072 --> 01:07:17.827
CRAIG: Okay. Do you
have any pages for me?

01:07:18.117 --> 01:07:19.960
RYAN:
Oh, urn, yes.

01:07:20.662 --> 01:07:22.585
Sorry.

01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:30.888
CRAIG: That--
This is it?

01:07:31.172 --> 01:07:33.015
RYAN:
Yeah.

01:07:35.134 --> 01:07:37.102
CRAIG: Okay,
Ryan.

01:07:37.387 --> 01:07:41.108
This quarter is almost over.
This isn't even halfway.

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:42.984

I know.

01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:47.022
CRAIG:
Okay...

01:07:47.313 --> 01:07:49.566
Take these.
Take them.

01:07:50.149 --> 01:07:53.949
Come back next week
with 10 more pages.

01:07:54.237 --> 01:07:57.081
All right?
Now go. Work.

Hey.

RYAN :
Hey.

01:08:25.184 --> 01:08:27.937
KEVIN: How's your
dating coming along?

01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:30.027
[Ryan chuckles]

01:08:30.314 --> 01:08:33.194
RYAN: I find myself repeatedly
trying to forgive him.

01:08:33.484 --> 01:08:36.953
And hoping that
he'll keep his word.

01:08:37.863 --> 01:08:38.990
But...

01:08:39.282 --> 01:08:43.127
He's been nonresponsive
and he's postponed, so...

01:08:46.163 --> 01:08:49.087
KEVIN: Why don't
you just move on?

01:08:50.001 --> 01:08:51.877
RYAN:
You think I should?

01:08:52.170 --> 01:08:54.013
KEVIN:
I don't know.

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:56.140
But clearly you won't.

01:08:57.175 --> 01:09:00.099
There's gotta
be a good reason.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:03.644
RYAN:
You're right.

01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:07.443
But I don't
know what it is.

01:09:07.727 --> 01:09:10.526
KEVIN:
I'm sure you do.

[sighs]

01:09:24.535 --> 01:09:26.377
RYAN:
Because...

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:34.591
Because I have
faith it'll work.

01:09:47.308 --> 01:09:49.231
KELLI:
Look!

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:55.071
RYAN: Good, now you know
your suffering wasn't in vain.

01:09:55.358 --> 01:09:57.201
KELLI:
Thanks?

01:09:58.277 --> 01:10:00.200
EUGENE:
You okay, pal?

01:10:00.738 --> 01:10:02.661
RYAN:
Yeah.

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:05.034
You guys are
in love, right?

01:10:05.326 --> 01:10:07.124
KELLI: Yeah, of course.
EUGENE: Yes.

01:10:07.412 --> 01:10:11.042
RYAN: Okay, okay, you don't
have to prove it or anything.

01:10:11.332 --> 01:10:13.334
KELLI: Ryan, what's wrong?
RYAN: Nothing.

01:10:13.626 --> 01:10:15.128
All I'm saying is that

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:18.515
the suffering God gave
you for love was worth it.

01:10:18.798 --> 01:10:21.642
It paid off. You
found each other.

01:10:21.926 --> 01:10:23.178
EUGENE: God does
not give us suffering.

01:10:23.469 --> 01:10:25.221
That's something we
inflict on ourselves.

01:10:25.513 --> 01:10:27.106
RYAN: Yeah,
by needing love.

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:29.108
KELLI: God's love is
more than sufficient.

01:10:29.392 --> 01:10:30.314
He provides us
with enough--

01:10:30.601 --> 01:10:32.444
RYAN:
I know, I know.

01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:35.023
But...

01:10:35.314 --> 01:10:38.238
I'm sorry, it's
just not enough.

01:10:38.526 --> 01:10:40.574
I need another human
being to love me too.

01:10:40.862 --> 01:10:44.207
KELLI: Well, then you've
never understood God's love.

01:10:44.490 --> 01:10:46.208
RYAN: Then why are you
guys getting married?

01:10:46.492 --> 01:10:48.836
EUGENE: Because God
wants us to get married.

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:51.214
We're obedient to God.

01:10:52.039 --> 01:10:53.382
RYAN:
This is going nowhere.

01:10:53.666 --> 01:10:56.169
KELLI: Well, that's because
you don't have a valid point.

01:10:56.461 --> 01:10:59.180
RYAN: Okay. Your
obedience is to the nature

01:10:59.464 --> 01:11:02.308
that God created
within us.

01:11:02.717 --> 01:11:05.766
This nature causes
some of us to suffer.

01:11:06.053 --> 01:11:07.396
KELLI: The nature
you're talking about

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:09.682
is a result
of the fall.

01:11:09.974 --> 01:11:12.068
RYAN: Oh, and
our all-knowing God

01:11:12.351 --> 01:11:14.069
didn't know that
the fall would occur?

01:11:14.353 --> 01:11:15.479
It wasn't part
of his masterplan?

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:17.240
EUGENE:
It was,

01:11:17.523 --> 01:11:20.527
That's what makes
God so good, man.

01:11:20.818 --> 01:11:24.539
He gave us free will
despite us going against him.

01:11:24.822 --> 01:11:26.244
RYAN:
Okay, see that...

01:11:26.532 --> 01:11:29.376
That's what I hate
about theology.

01:11:30.369 --> 01:11:31.461
EUGENE:
What?

01:11:31.746 --> 01:11:35.296
RYAN: Theology is
justifying senseless beliefs

01:11:35.583 --> 01:11:40.214
with elaborate
pontifications.

01:11:40.505 --> 01:11:42.473
Isn't it easier
just to say,

01:11:42.757 --> 01:11:45.431
God was not good in
making us need love

01:11:45.718 --> 01:11:48.187
and hence, suffering?

01:11:51.098 --> 01:11:53.100
EUGENE:
Dude...

01:11:53.392 --> 01:11:56.236
Why are you
still in seminary?

01:11:57.522 --> 01:12:00.822
KELLI: Why are you
still a Christian?

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:05.284
RYAN: Because my
faith isn't narrow.

01:12:06.823 --> 01:12:08.746
I gotta go,

01:12:11.369 --> 01:12:13.292
Anthony, wait up.

01:12:15.373 --> 01:12:16.124
Did Jeff forgive you?

ANTHONY: Shush!
Not so loud.

01:12:18.459 --> 01:12:19.255
RYAN:
Well, tell me.

01:12:19.544 --> 01:12:21.217
ANTHONY:
Okay, he is gone.

01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:24.383

RYAN: [indistinct]
ANTHONY: No, no.

01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:27.219
ANTHONY: Look...
RYAN: Do you need to talk?

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:31.356

need to be alone right now.

up with Ryan.

you here, dear?

01:13:08.092 --> 01:13:10.311
RYAN: Well, it's
Dad's anniversary.

01:13:11.512 --> 01:13:15.938
CINDY: Yes, but I thought
I told you not to come.

I know.

01:13:18.644 --> 01:13:21.523

want to go.

Um... Okay.

01:14:36.597 --> 01:14:38.440
Sure.

01:14:48.234 --> 01:14:51.363
KELLI: Do you wanna go watch
a movie with me and Eugene?

01:14:51.654 --> 01:14:52.871
RYAN:
Yeah, okay.

01:14:53.155 --> 01:14:54.452
As long as it's
not depressing.

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:57.334
KELLI: Of course.
How's next Thursday sound?

01:14:58.536 --> 01:15:00.459
RYAN:
Yeah, that's fine.

Ryan, are you okay?

01:15:10.089 --> 01:15:11.887

No, actually, I'm not.

KELLI:
Why'?

01:15:15.636 --> 01:15:17.559
RYAN: It's this
fucking thesis.

01:15:18.639 --> 01:15:20.607
I know I want
to do a good job

01:15:20.891 --> 01:15:22.859
I know I want
to go to Yale.

01:15:23.144 --> 01:15:25.522
And I know I
want to teach.

01:15:25.813 --> 01:15:27.406
But I'm just
not motivated.

01:15:28.607 --> 01:15:30.359

I'm sorry, Ryan.

01:15:30.651 --> 01:15:32.324
RYAN:
It's okay.

01:15:32.611 --> 01:15:35.455
KELLI: Is there anything
outside bothering you?

01:15:37.783 --> 01:15:39.706
RYAN: Outside?
KELLI: Yeah.

01:15:42.038 --> 01:15:43.756
RYAN: Like what?
Outside what?

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:46.384
KELLI:
I mean, romantically.

01:15:46.667 --> 01:15:48.510
RYAN:
Romantically?

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:51.882
KELLI: Yeah, are
you seeing anyone?

01:15:52.173 --> 01:15:53.550
RYAN: Am I?
I don't know.

01:15:53.841 --> 01:15:56.594
KELLI: What do you
mean, you don't know?

01:15:56.886 --> 01:15:59.389
RYAN: I just--
I don't know.

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:02.524
KELLI:
Well, who is she?

01:16:07.521 --> 01:16:10.445
RYAN: Actually,
if you must know,

01:16:11.275 --> 01:16:12.572
his name is Bradley

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:15.454
and he is supposed to
come see me tonight.

01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.413
KELLI:
So you're gay?

01:16:20.326 --> 01:16:22.249
RYAN:
Yup.

01:16:23.746 --> 01:16:25.043
KELLI:
You know...

01:16:25.331 --> 01:16:28.710
When I was with Eugene,
I was attracted to a girl once

01:16:29.001 --> 01:16:30.969
but thankfully I didn't
make that choice.

01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:32.846
RYAN: It's not
a choice, Kelli.

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:34.177
It's God's creation.

01:16:34.465 --> 01:16:36.593
KELLI: Adam and Eve
were God's creation.

01:16:36.884 --> 01:16:37.726
RYAN: Okay, you
should know better

01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:38.886
than to argue
from Genesis.

01:16:39.178 --> 01:16:41.647
KELLI: And what
about Romans...?

01:16:41.931 --> 01:16:43.023
RYAN: Did it
ever occur to you

01:16:43.307 --> 01:16:44.433
that Paul just might
be wrong sometimes?

01:16:44.725 --> 01:16:47.569
KELLI: No, Ryan!
You are backsliding.

01:16:47.937 --> 01:16:49.484
[Ryan scoffs]

01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:51.615

Nice one, Kelli.

01:16:57.196 --> 01:16:59.119

I still love you.

01:17:02.368 --> 01:17:04.291

I love you too, sister.

BRADLEY:
How are you?

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:41.536
RYAN:
I'm good.

01:17:41.824 --> 01:17:44.668
I was just wondering when
you're gonna get here.

01:17:44.952 --> 01:17:46.920
BRADLEY: Can we
please postpone?

01:17:47.746 --> 01:17:49.669
RYAN:
What? Why?

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:54.719
BRADLEY:
I'm just not happy.

01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:58.474
And I'm not good to
be around right now.

01:17:58.757 --> 01:18:01.556
RYAN: Well, when will
you be good to be around?

01:18:01.844 --> 01:18:03.687
BRADLEY:
I don't know.

01:18:05.723 --> 01:18:07.725
RYAN:
Look...

01:18:08.017 --> 01:18:10.736
Am I ever gonna
see you again?

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:12.237
BRADLEY:
I hope so.

01:18:12.521 --> 01:18:14.364
RYAN:
You hope so?

01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:18.444
Bradley...

01:18:18.736 --> 01:18:21.580
I don't know how much
more of this I can take.

01:18:21.906 --> 01:18:23.579
BRADLEY:
I'm sorry.

01:18:23.991 --> 01:18:26.915
Please don't give me
any more stress.

01:18:28.621 --> 01:18:31.545
RYAN: I just want to know
if we'll ever meet again.

01:18:31.832 --> 01:18:33.175
BRADLEY: I'm gonna
start crying again,

01:18:33.459 --> 01:18:35.678
can we please
talk later?

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:39.553
RYAN :
Okay.

I finished my thesis.

Bradley called you right now...

My thesis.

The whole thing?

RYAN:
Yep.

01:29:19.855 --> 01:29:21.357
CRAIG: Well, I knew
you would deliver

01:29:21.648 --> 01:29:24.151
but I wasn't
expecting it this soon.

01:29:24.442 --> 01:29:27.116

two weeks anyway.

How did you do it?

really slept much.

discuss your conclusion.

I know.

CRAIG:
So how does it end?

01:29:46.298 --> 01:29:51.395
RYAN: Well, I concluded that
love necessitates relationships

01:29:51.678 --> 01:29:55.273
And relationships
necessitates forgiveness.

01:29:55.974 --> 01:29:58.193
At the end of the day,

01:29:58.476 --> 01:29:59.853
we have to learn
to forgive those

01:30:00.145 --> 01:30:02.819
that we are in a
relationship with.

Why do you ask?

01:30:19.456 --> 01:30:21.379
CRAIG: Well, to be
perfectly honest with you,

01:30:21.666 --> 01:30:25.387
Someone mentioned that
you might be dating a guy.

01:30:25.670 --> 01:30:27.968
RYAN:
Who said that?

01:30:28.256 --> 01:30:29.473
CRAIG:
That's not important.

01:30:29.758 --> 01:30:33.604
I told that person
to keep it to herself.

01:30:34.429 --> 01:30:36.272
RYAN:
Was it Kelli?

01:30:36.556 --> 01:30:39.184
CRAIG: What's
crucial though, Ryan

01:30:39.476 --> 01:30:42.400
is that you also
keep it to yourself.

01:30:42.687 --> 01:30:42.778

I know.

I have to check
with Kelli
