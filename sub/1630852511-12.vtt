because the "Meatball"--

00:04.805 --> 00:06.739
- Get out of the way, bitch.

I think you're funny.

You make me laugh all the time.

Here's what we do,
a lie detector test.

00:19.253 --> 00:20.219

- Yeah.

Ooh.

- Oh, my God.

01:30.458 --> 01:33.125
- Yeah.
- Nice.

01:33.194 --> 01:34.560
- It's a lot skinnier
than a bat.

01:34.628 --> 01:36.095
- All right, we're gonna show
you guys how it's done.

01:36.163 --> 01:37.296

Oh, my God.

they're gonna start running.

02:44.632 --> 02:45.797

They're just skipping.

This is like
a terrible comedy show.

Whoo.

06:49.276 --> 06:52.911
- That was the dumbest race
I've ever seen in my life.

06:52.980 --> 06:55.180
- Zack ran, actually,
the wrong way.

06:55.249 --> 06:58.483
- Oh, my God. Yeah!

06:59.353 --> 07:01.620
- I can't. Oh, my God.

07:01.688 --> 07:03.355
- That wasn't even a contest.

07:03.424 --> 07:04.923
- Congrats, Chris.

07:04.992 --> 07:08.160
Zack talks a lot of [bleep]
for losing.

07:08.228 --> 07:11.563
- So Uncle Pauly left
your daddy a little note.

07:11.632 --> 07:14.266
"Hey, Mike.
I booked a lie detector.

07:14.334 --> 07:15.700
He's on the way."

07:15.769 --> 07:17.669
- "He knows to ask for you,
The Investigation.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.371
Good luck. Your boy, Pauly D."

07:19.440 --> 07:23.708
- We got a situation.
I know this is the last night.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.845
I know there's--the vibes
have been great.

07:26.914 --> 07:30.882
But at the end of the day,
I can't besmirch Pauly D.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.418
I have to execute
this just right.

07:33.487 --> 07:36.888
- How do you put a positive
spin on a lie detector?

07:36.957 --> 07:39.291
I can only imagine
their response

07:39.359 --> 07:40.792
when they see a lie detector,

07:40.861 --> 07:42.327
so I'm just gonna sit
this one out,

07:42.396 --> 07:44.696
act observational...
- Okay.

07:44.765 --> 07:45.997
- And that's all.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.366
- Well, here's the thing.
This is a fun activity.

07:48.435 --> 07:49.835
- And listen--
- Why is every--why would

07:49.903 --> 07:51.436
everyone think of it
as a negative activity?

07:51.505 --> 07:52.571
- Because it's a lie detector.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.206
Traditionally you get
a lie detector

07:54.274 --> 07:59.010
to prove someone's guiltiness,
not innocence, usually.

07:59.079 --> 08:02.180
I love my husband,
but it's just, like,

08:02.249 --> 08:04.583
<i> "Dude, like,</i>
<i> do you not see this coming?"</i>

08:04.651 --> 08:06.151

08:06.220 --> 08:08.220
- No one has anything
to hide here.

08:08.288 --> 08:10.088
- Um, I hope not.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.090
Let's just not ask
what can go wrong on this one.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.859
Good luck, honey.
- You ready for this?

08:13.927 --> 08:15.126
- I'm down.
- Let's go.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.394
Somebody left a note.

08:16.463 --> 08:18.396
- What the hell?

08:18.465 --> 08:20.565
- I'm a little bit worried

08:20.634 --> 08:22.267
about the bomb
we left them with.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.703
- Oh, man.
- "I booked a lie detector."

08:24.771 --> 08:26.571
- It's just dumb.
- Okay, what the [bleep], man?

Enrique's ruining my life.

35:44.977 --> 35:47.444
- CJ, how's it look?
Good or ridiculous?

- Ridiculous.
- Yo, yo, yo, what's up?

35:49.281 --> 35:51.581
- Oh, good. Everybody's
wearing their jammies.

35:51.650 --> 35:54.851
- Deena of course sent us
all matching PJs.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.554
- Oh, yay! Everyone.

35:57.623 --> 36:00.824
- So I got all of us
matching tropical shirts.

- Oh, they're gonna love that.

36:03.529 --> 36:05.729
- How cute will that be?

36:05.797 --> 36:09.132
- They're gonna get
a little glimpse of my reality.

36:09.201 --> 36:13.069
- Oh, please. You love it.
So it's been an amazing trip.

36:13.138 --> 36:16.439
And today we're gonna
do family matching photos.

36:16.508 --> 36:19.109
And it's gonna go down

- What's up, dude?
- Hey, Sissy.

36:26.251 --> 36:28.418
- Hey Sissy.
- Morning.

36:28.487 --> 36:29.853
- Before breakfast,
I have, like,

36:29.922 --> 36:31.922
one more little thing
that I wanna do.

36:31.990 --> 36:33.723
- Oh, God.
- Wait one second.

36:33.792 --> 36:35.091
- Oh, my God,
another dead body.

36:35.160 --> 36:36.426
- I can't handle any more.
- Another dead body.

36:36.495 --> 36:39.329
I can't take
any more surprises.

36:39.398 --> 36:42.365
- So as you can see
CJ's ensemble,

36:42.434 --> 36:45.168
I would like to do
a matching family photo.

36:45.237 --> 36:47.437
I feel like it would be
really cute.

36:47.506 --> 36:49.739
- So Deena's had
too many good ideas.

36:49.808 --> 36:52.075
- Welcome to murder
mystery dinner.

36:52.144 --> 36:54.411
- Throw Deena in the pool.
- We're going on

36:54.479 --> 36:57.147
a mansion boat today.

36:57.216 --> 36:58.215
- Mansion boat?

36:58.283 --> 37:01.318

37:07.259 --> 37:08.825
- More like orgy.
- Orgy.

37:08.894 --> 37:11.728
- So we needed to get back
to Deena's bad ideas

37:11.797 --> 37:16.132
and take a family photo
in a weird tropical outfit.

37:16.201 --> 37:19.102
- I'm tired.
- Another vacation in the book.

37:19.171 --> 37:20.737
- We can't forget
Pauly and Nicky.

37:20.806 --> 37:23.173
- Here, Vin, your tripod

37:23.242 --> 37:25.342
or your--whatever
you call yourself.

37:25.410 --> 37:27.077
- One, two, three.

37:27.145 --> 37:30.413
all: Family vacation.

37:30.482 --> 37:31.848
- 13 years ago

37:31.917 --> 37:34.718
I would have never expected
to be in the Florida Keys

<i> with everyone and their wives</i>
<i> and their kids.</i>

37:37.356 --> 37:39.189
Like, we're still doing it.

37:39.258 --> 37:40.457
- I love you guys.
I gotta go.

37:40.525 --> 37:42.559
- All right.
Have a safe flight.

37:42.628 --> 37:44.060
- Bye.
- See you later.

37:44.129 --> 37:45.161
- Leave the shirt on.

37:45.230 --> 37:47.731
It's time to
get back to Jersey.

37:47.799 --> 37:50.000
- So I feel like the plan
went perfect.

37:50.068 --> 37:51.968
Everybody loved their shirts.

37:52.037 --> 37:53.903
- Jesus Christ!
What the [bleep] is this?

37:53.972 --> 37:56.706
- Yeah, this is...
- Everyone looked so good.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.508
- Can you imagine
wearing this again?

37:58.577 --> 38:00.143
- Oh, no.
I'm never wearing this again.

38:00.212 --> 38:01.378
- No.

38:01.446 --> 38:02.912
- It's definitely frame-worthy
this one.

38:02.981 --> 38:04.881
- Definitely.
- This is dirty.

38:04.950 --> 38:06.182
- Why does this smell?

38:06.251 --> 38:09.252
All these stink.
What's that smell like?

38:09.321 --> 38:13.390
It was a great vacation.
We had a blast as a family.

38:13.458 --> 38:18.194
<i> We're islanders now.</i>
<i> The Keys was a total success.</i>

38:18.263 --> 38:21.931

- Did you have fun
this vacation, Mo-Mo?

38:24.803 --> 38:25.735
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

38:25.804 --> 38:30.173
What was your best part?

38:30.242 --> 38:33.343
- Chillin' and getting tan?
I love you. And I'm sad.

38:33.412 --> 38:36.379
I don't wanna leave.
Did you have the best time?

38:41.053 --> 38:42.852
I need a piña colada.

38:42.921 --> 38:45.855
Bye, vacation.

38:45.924 --> 38:47.023
- Okay. All right, we're out.

38:47.092 --> 38:50.360
- Romeo's first vacation
was a success.

38:50.429 --> 38:52.829
- Yes.
- Right, baby? Yay!

38:52.898 --> 38:55.131
- You almost ready?
I got Cameron on me.

38:55.200 --> 38:56.433
We're going.

38:56.501 --> 39:01.638
All right. Back to Jersey.
Team Buckner is out.

39:01.707 --> 39:03.673
- Are you taking that
on the plane?

39:03.742 --> 39:04.741
- This?

39:04.810 --> 39:06.409
Yeah, of course,
on the other plane.

39:06.478 --> 39:07.944
- Underneath the plane?
- Yeah.

39:08.013 --> 39:10.080
Where would I [bleep] put it?
I don't care where they put it

39:10.148 --> 39:11.781
as long as
it's--I don't give a [bleep].

39:11.850 --> 39:13.750
- Before this trip,
Chris and I,

39:13.819 --> 39:15.285
<i> we were not</i>
<i> in a good place at all.</i>

39:15.354 --> 39:18.755
But I think this vacation was--
it was good for both of us.

<i> I don't know what the future</i>
<i> is gonna hold.</i>

39:20.459 --> 39:25.028
But hopefully, we'll be on the
track of goodness from here.

39:25.097 --> 39:26.296
- All right,
we're running late.

39:26.365 --> 39:29.666
We're gonna miss our flight.
Say bye to CJ.

39:29.735 --> 39:30.867
[together]
Aww.

39:30.936 --> 39:32.469

39:32.537 --> 39:34.838
- No, he's sad.
- Aww.

39:34.906 --> 39:38.074
- I love you. Mwah!
Overall, I had a blast.
