WEBVTT

00:02.669 --> 00:04.129
- HOT IN CLEVELAND
IS RECORDED

00:04.212 --> 00:06.005
IN FRONT OF A LIVE
STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:06.089 --> 00:08.258
- YOU LOST MY DRESS?

00:08.341 --> 00:11.469
THAT WASN'T JUST ANY DRESS.
THAT WAS MY <i> MAGIC</i> DRESS.

00:11.553 --> 00:13.555
I ALWAYS LOOK AMAZING
IN IT.

00:13.638 --> 00:16.933
IT'S FORM-FITTING,
BUT IT DOESN'T SUCK ME IN.

00:17.016 --> 00:18.601
I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO
WEAR A SHAPER WITH IT.

00:18.685 --> 00:22.480
THE DRESS IS A SHAPER.
MAGIC!

00:22.564 --> 00:23.481
YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:23.565 --> 00:24.899
LET ME JUST TALK
TO A WOMAN.

00:24.983 --> 00:28.236
OH, I'M SORRY, MA'AM.

00:28.319 --> 00:29.612
I GUESS I'M NOT THE FIRST ONE
TO MAKE THAT MISTA--

00:29.696 --> 00:32.031
I AM?

00:32.115 --> 00:33.950
WELL, CAN YOU JUST TEXT ME
WHEN YOU FIND THE DRESS?

00:34.033 --> 00:35.160
THANK YOU.

00:35.243 --> 00:36.494
UNBELIEVABLE.
- I KNOW.

00:36.578 --> 00:39.497
OUR DRY-CLEANER GUY
IS A WOMAN?

00:39.581 --> 00:43.209
<i>SHE'S</i> CHECKING TO SEE
IF SHE DELIVERED IT

00:43.293 --> 00:44.294
TO SOMEONE ELSE
BY MISTAKE.

00:44.377 --> 00:46.421
[thuds from upstairs]
- JOY'S UP.

00:46.504 --> 00:48.923
FROWNS, EVERYBODY.
FROWNS.

00:49.007 --> 00:50.508
- WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME
TO FROWN?

00:50.592 --> 00:54.179
WHEN I SEE JOY,
IT'S AUTOMATIC.

00:54.262 --> 00:55.805
- IT'S THE ANNIVERSARY
OF THE DAY

00:55.889 --> 00:56.973
SHE WAS LEFT AT THE ALTAR.

00:57.056 --> 00:59.142
- YEAH, HER "NON"
ANNIVERSARY.

00:59.225 --> 01:01.060
- SO JUST GO EASY ON HER,
OKAY?

01:01.144 --> 01:03.813
SHE'S EXTRA SENSITIVE.
- GOT IT.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.272
- OH, GOOD MORNING, JOY.

01:05.355 --> 01:07.275
I MADE COFFEE.
POURED YOU A CUP.

01:07.358 --> 01:08.860
HERE YOU GO.
- OH, GREAT. WHATEVER.

01:08.943 --> 01:10.195
- I STOPPED AT THE BAKERY
ON FRANKLIN

01:10.278 --> 01:11.112
AND I GOT YOU
A CHOCOLATE CROISSANT.

01:11.196 --> 01:13.615
- THAT'S NICE. THANKS.

01:13.698 --> 01:16.659
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT DRIED UP OLD THING?

01:16.743 --> 01:18.119
- IT'S MY WEDDING BOUQUET.

01:18.203 --> 01:21.122
- I WAS TALKING
TO THE BOUQUET.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.836
[ringtone chimes]

01:26.920 --> 01:28.838
- OOH, THEY HAVE THE NUMBER
OF THE WOMAN

01:28.922 --> 01:32.509
WHO HAS MY MAGIC DRESS.

01:32.592 --> 01:37.347
HELLO, HI. COULD I SPEAK TO
JENNY VAN ALSTYNE, PLEASE?

01:37.430 --> 01:39.015
OH. OH, I'M SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

01:39.098 --> 01:43.061
SHE DIED.

01:43.144 --> 01:44.687
LISTEN, THERE WAS A MIX-UP
AT THE DRY CLEANERS,

01:44.771 --> 01:47.357
AND MY DRESS GOT DELIVERED
TO HER.

01:47.440 --> 01:50.193
SO I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD
SWING BY TODAY AND PICK--

01:50.276 --> 01:53.571
OH, TODAY'S THE FUNERAL?

01:53.655 --> 01:54.739
WELL, IT'LL JUST TAKE
A FEW MINUTES.

01:54.823 --> 01:57.742
I COULD BE IN AND OUT--

01:57.826 --> 02:01.538
YEAH, I CAN SEE ON SOME LEVEL
HOW THAT MIGHT BE DISRESPECTFUL,

02:01.621 --> 02:05.375
BUT IF YOU COULD SEE ME
IN THIS DRESS...

02:05.458 --> 02:06.835
HELLO?

02:06.918 --> 02:09.878
I'M GONNA HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL TOMORROW.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.214
- NO, BUT IT MIGHT BE
TOO LATE.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.216
WHAT IF THE FAMILY
DONATES HER CLOTHES TO CHARITY

02:13.299 --> 02:14.342
AFTER THE FUNERAL?

02:14.425 --> 02:16.261
- NO, NO, NO.
I CAN'T LOSE THAT DRESS

02:16.344 --> 02:17.846
IT'S IRREPLACEABLE.

02:17.929 --> 02:19.222
I MEAN, IT GOES
FROM DAY TO NIGHT.

02:19.305 --> 02:20.557
IT DRESSES UP OR DOWN.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.225
- UGH, I CAN'T BEAR THE THOUGHT
OF IT GOING

02:22.308 --> 02:23.726
TO A HOMELESS PERSON.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.271
THEY'D ONLY
DRESS IT DOWN.

02:26.354 --> 02:29.566
- ALL I NEED IS
A COUPLE OF MINUTES

02:29.649 --> 02:32.277
IN THE DEAD WOMAN'S CLOSET
TO FIND MY DRESS.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.737
- YOU NEED TO FIND A WAY
TO GET INVITED TO THAT FUNERAL.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.407
- JUST CRASH IT.

02:37.490 --> 02:38.575
- CRASH A FUNERAL?

02:38.658 --> 02:40.743
- I CRASH FUNERALS
ALL THE TIME.

02:40.827 --> 02:43.413
TO MEET MEN.

02:43.496 --> 02:46.624
- OKAY, HOW DO WE CRASH
THE FUNERAL?

02:46.708 --> 02:49.043
- WELL, FIND SOME DETAILS
IN HER OBIT

02:49.127 --> 02:51.087
SO WE CAN JUST BLEND IN.

02:51.170 --> 02:52.589
<i>WE?</i> WHAT,
YOU'RE GOING WITH ME?

02:52.672 --> 02:54.549
- WELL, I'M NOT GONNA
LET YOU HAVE

02:54.632 --> 02:57.427
ALL THOSE GRIEVING HOTTIES
TO YOURSELF.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.429
- OKAY, HERE'S HER OBIT.

02:59.512 --> 03:02.891
"JENNY VAN ALSTYNE,
82 YEARS OLD.

03:02.974 --> 03:04.809
AVID COLLECTOR OF COINS..."
BORING.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.561
"HUMMEL FIGURINES..."
CREEPY.

03:06.644 --> 03:09.898
AND HOLD ON...
<i>"SOAP OPERA DIGEST."</i>

03:09.981 --> 03:12.442
SHE HAD EVERY ISSUE OF <i> SOAP</i>
<i>OPERA DIGEST</i> EVER PRINTED.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.110
- SO?
- SO...

03:14.193 --> 03:17.780
I WAS ON THE COVER
NOVEMBER 27th, 1988.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.616
OH, I LOST MY COPY
YEARS AGO,

03:19.699 --> 03:22.076
AND I HAVE BEEN ON A MISSION
TO FIND ANOTHER ONE EVER SINCE.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.161
I'M GOING WITH YOU.

03:23.244 --> 03:25.788
- ME TOO.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.582
I CAN'T BE ALONE TODAY.

03:27.665 --> 03:29.626
AND A FUNERAL IS THE ONLY PLACE
I CAN CRY IN PUBLIC

03:29.709 --> 03:32.462
WHERE PEOPLE WON'T ASK ME
WHAT'S WRONG.

03:32.545 --> 03:36.466
- AND AFTERWARDS, I'LL TAKE YOU
TO A BROWNS GAME.

03:36.549 --> 03:39.719
IT'S OKAY TO CRY
IN PUBLIC THERE TOO.

03:50.521 --> 03:53.483
{\an8}- SO WHAT ARE THE FUNERAL
CRASHER RULES?

03:53.566 --> 03:55.860
{\an8}- NUMBER ONE, IF YOU THINK
YOU'RE GONNA GET CAUGHT,

03:55.944 --> 03:56.819
{\an8}JUST SAY YOU'RE
OVERCOME WITH EMOTION,

03:56.903 --> 03:58.446
{\an8}AND WALK AWAY.

03:58.529 --> 04:00.990
{\an8}- NUMBER TWO, WHEN
COMING UP WITH A COVER STORY,

04:01.074 --> 04:02.992
{\an8}SPECIFIC DETAILS
MAKE LIES MORE BELIEVABLE.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.995
{\an8}- NUMBER THREE,
PICK AN ALIAS

04:06.079 --> 04:07.246
{\an8}THAT'S CLOSE
TO YOUR REAL NAME

04:07.330 --> 04:09.666
{\an8}SO IT'LL BE EASY
TO REMEMBER.

04:09.749 --> 04:12.794
{\an8}FOR YOU NEOPHYTES, MAYBE,
BUT I AM A TRAINED ACTRESS.

04:12.877 --> 04:16.673
{\an8}I WILL ME ZELDA
EUGENE HACKENBROOK.

04:16.755 --> 04:18.423
{\an8}- OH, THE STAIRS ARE CLEAR.

04:18.507 --> 04:19.509
{\an8}I'M GONNA GO SEE
IF I CAN FIND MY DRESS.

04:19.591 --> 04:21.177
{\an8}- OH, I'LL COME WITH YOU.

04:21.260 --> 04:24.639
{\an8}MAYBE MY <i> SOAP OPERA DIGEST</i>
IS UP THERE.

04:24.722 --> 04:27.350
{\an8}- SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

04:27.433 --> 04:29.852
{\an8}- IT'S TIME TO CHECK OUT
THE TALENT.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.356
{\an8}HELLO.

04:33.439 --> 04:34.899
{\an8}GOOD-BYE.

04:40.780 --> 04:43.366
{\an8}- SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL BRIDE,
WASN'T SHE?

04:43.449 --> 04:45.368
{\an8}- SHE LOOKS SO HAPPY.

04:45.451 --> 04:48.663
{\an8}THE GROOM SHOWED UP,
DIDN'T HE?

04:48.746 --> 04:50.415
{\an8}- YOU MEAN MY GRANDFATHER?

04:50.498 --> 04:52.208
{\an8}YES, HE--
HE SHOWED UP.

04:52.291 --> 04:53.876
{\an8}HOW DID YOU KNOW
MY GRANDMOTHER?

04:53.960 --> 04:57.213
{\an8}- WE MET AT
A COLLECTORS CONVENTION.

04:57.296 --> 05:00.550
HUMMEL-CON.

05:00.633 --> 05:03.886
WE TALKED ABOUT COINS.
NICKELS MOSTLY.

05:03.970 --> 05:07.098
OH, HOW SHE LOVED NICKELS.

05:07.181 --> 05:08.975
- HUMMEL-CON.

05:09.058 --> 05:13.855
- PEOPLE DRESS UP
AS FAMOUS HUMMELS.

05:13.938 --> 05:17.775
I WENT AS WISHING WELL GIRL.

05:17.859 --> 05:21.696
SORRY, I'M OVERCOME
WITH EMOTION.

05:21.779 --> 05:23.698
- NOW, WHO NEEDS
COMFORTING?

05:23.781 --> 05:26.784
TWO SHOULDERS,
NO WAITING.

05:26.868 --> 05:28.911
- HI, ELKA.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.414
- I'M SORRY,
DO I KNOW YOU?

05:31.497 --> 05:33.583
- IT'S ROY,
FROM THE RESTAURANT.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.251
- AH...I KNEW A ROY...

05:35.334 --> 05:37.253
WHO SAID HE WAS GONNA CALL ME,
BUT NEVER DID.

05:37.336 --> 05:40.798
COULD YOU FIND THAT ROY
AND TELL HIM

05:40.882 --> 05:43.509
ELKA'S NOT INTERESTED?

05:43.593 --> 05:46.304
- COULD YOU FELLAS
GIVE US A MOMENT?

05:46.387 --> 05:49.098
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE
STILL MAD AT ME,

05:49.182 --> 05:50.975
BUT I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.227
- YOU'VE GOT TWO MINUTES.

05:53.311 --> 05:55.271
- I KNOW THIS SOUNDS
CRAZY,

05:55.354 --> 05:58.274
BUT I BELIEVE THE DECEASED
WAS MURDERED.

05:58.357 --> 06:00.985
- WHAT?

06:01.069 --> 06:02.403
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?

06:02.487 --> 06:04.322
- WELL, THAT NIGHT
THAT WE WENT OUT,

06:04.405 --> 06:06.449
YOU MENTIONED THAT
YOU ALWAYS FIGURED OUT

06:06.532 --> 06:09.285
WHO THE KILLER IS
IN THOSE <i> CSI</i> SHOWS

06:09.368 --> 06:11.287
WITHIN THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES.

06:11.370 --> 06:15.625
- THAT'S BECAUSE I RECOGNIZE
THE GUEST STARS.

06:15.708 --> 06:18.586
YOU DON'T HIRE
A TONY DANZA

06:18.669 --> 06:22.924
TO PLAY A HOTEL CONCIERGE
WITH THREE LINES.

06:23.007 --> 06:26.511
- SEE, THAT'S THE INSIGHT
WE NEED TO SOLVE THIS CASE.

06:26.594 --> 06:28.137
- WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
SHE WAS MURDERED?

06:28.221 --> 06:31.265
- I LIVE NEXT DOOR,
AND THE NIGHT SHE DIED,

06:31.349 --> 06:33.476
I SAW HER LIVE-IN NURSE
BURYING

06:33.559 --> 06:37.313
WHAT LOOKED LIKE A SYRINGE
IN THE BACKYARD.

06:37.396 --> 06:39.690
OF COURSE,
IT COULD BE NOTHING.

06:39.774 --> 06:42.151
- I'VE GOT A SHOVEL
IN MY TRUNK.

06:44.403 --> 06:47.490
- HEY, HOW YOU DOING?
- HMM.

06:47.573 --> 06:49.700
WELL, I'VE ONLY CRIED
UNCONTROLLABLY TWICE,

06:49.784 --> 06:51.953
SO I THINK THE FUNERAL'S
STARTING TO CHEER ME UP.

06:52.036 --> 06:54.122
- MMM.
- DID YOU FIND YOUR DRESS?

06:54.205 --> 06:55.665
- NO. IT'S NOT IN ANY
OF THE CLOSETS UPSTAIRS.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.166
- OH, DON'T WORRY,
WE'LL FIND IT.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.168
- IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE
TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS,

06:59.252 --> 07:01.212
PLEASE, FEEL FREE.

07:05.591 --> 07:08.136
- [gasp]
OH, MY GOD!

07:08.219 --> 07:11.013
THAT'S MY DRESS.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.307
- SHE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL,
DOESN'T SHE?

07:13.391 --> 07:16.727
- IT'S THE <i> DRESS!</i>

07:27.405 --> 07:29.699
- THAT WAS A BUST.

07:29.782 --> 07:31.534
THOSE MOURNERS WERE
LOOKING AT US

07:31.617 --> 07:33.411
LIKE WE WERE CRAZY.
- YEAH.

07:33.494 --> 07:35.037
THEY DIDN'T BUY THAT
I WAS TRYING TO GET IN

07:35.121 --> 07:39.208
A LITTLE SHOVELING PRACTICE
BEFORE THE BURIAL.

07:41.669 --> 07:42.837
YOU KNOW,
WE'VE GOTTA FIND SOME PROOF

07:42.920 --> 07:44.755
THAT JENNY DIDN'T DIE
OF NATURAL CAUSES.

07:44.839 --> 07:49.594
- NOBODY DIES OF
NATURAL CAUSES AT 82.

07:49.677 --> 07:52.430
SHE WAS JUST A KID.
- YEAH.

07:52.513 --> 07:55.725
I HEARD HER LAWYER SAY
SHE RECENTLY CHANGED HER WILL.

07:55.808 --> 07:57.393
IF WE CAN FIND A COPY,
WE CAN SEE

07:57.476 --> 08:01.856
IF THE NURSE HAD A MOTIVE.

08:01.939 --> 08:07.570
- ON <i> THE CLOSER,</i> SHE ALWAYS
CHECKS OUT THE COMPUTER FIRST.

08:09.322 --> 08:12.033
OH, IT'S PASSWORD
PROTECTED.

08:12.116 --> 08:13.367
- WELL, CAN YOU CRACK IT?

08:13.451 --> 08:16.245
- I CAN TRY.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.247
IT'S USUALLY
A GRANDKID'S NAME

08:18.331 --> 08:19.540
OR A PET'S NAME.

08:19.624 --> 08:22.877
OR A HOBBY. UH...

08:22.960 --> 08:24.378
BINGO!

08:24.462 --> 08:25.713
- WHAT WAS THE PASSWORD?

08:25.796 --> 08:27.924
- "BINGO."

08:28.007 --> 08:30.176
- YOU'RE AMAZING!

08:30.259 --> 08:36.432
- OH, LOOK, HER SCREENSAVER
IS THE TICKLISH LORIS.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.308
- WHAT IS THAT?

08:38.392 --> 08:42.605
- OH, IT'S ONLY THE CUTEST
ANIMAL VIDEO EVER.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.441
EXCEPT MAYBE
THE HONEY BADGER.

08:45.524 --> 08:47.276
- HONEY BADGER?

08:47.360 --> 08:50.488
- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

08:52.156 --> 08:53.908
- WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING
IN HERE?

08:53.991 --> 08:55.284
- BREAKING INTO
A DEAD WOMAN'S COMPUTER

08:55.368 --> 08:56.661
TO SOLVE A MURDER.

08:56.744 --> 08:58.746
- OH, LIKE ON <i> THE CLOSER.</i>
NO...

09:02.583 --> 09:06.254
<i>SOAP OPERA DIGEST...</i>

09:06.337 --> 09:10.591
AH. YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM ME,
YOUNG VICTORIA CHASE.

09:10.675 --> 09:13.511
OKAY, ANTHONY GEARY COVER...

09:13.594 --> 09:15.805
ERICA SLEZAK COVER.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.765
OH...AND THERE I AM.

09:17.848 --> 09:21.519
SANDWICHED BETWEEN JOHN STAMOS
AND RICK SPRINGFIELD.

09:21.602 --> 09:23.396
AGAIN.

09:24.730 --> 09:27.191
LOOK AT THAT FACE.

09:27.275 --> 09:30.987
ALL RIGHT, I'LL SAY IT.
I HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.864
OW.

09:33.948 --> 09:38.327
- SO YOU WERE RICKETY
BACK THEN TOO?

09:38.411 --> 09:41.330
- I'M NOT GOING TO EVEN
DIGNIFY THAT QUESTION

09:41.414 --> 09:43.499
BY STRAIGHTENING
MY NECK.

09:43.582 --> 09:46.794
- HONEY BADGER DON'T CARE.

09:46.877 --> 09:49.255
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND THAT
IN A MINUTE

09:55.469 --> 09:57.805
- LOOK AT THAT DRESS.
NO WRINKLES.

09:57.888 --> 09:59.181
THAT'S HOW WELL IT TRAVELS.

09:59.265 --> 10:02.018
IT GOES FROM HERE
TO ETERNITY.

10:02.101 --> 10:03.853
BUT HOW ARE WE GONNA
GET IT OFF HER?

10:03.936 --> 10:05.187
- WELL, A DRINK
AND A COUPLE OF COMPLIMENTS

10:05.271 --> 10:07.064
USUALLY WORKS FOR ME.

10:07.148 --> 10:09.483
WAIT A MINUTE,
YOU'RE SERIOUS.

10:09.567 --> 10:12.028
YOU'RE ACTUALLY CONTEMPLATING
TAKING A WOMAN'S BURIAL DRESS

10:12.111 --> 10:13.029
OFF HER BODY.

10:13.112 --> 10:14.572
- THAT'S MY DRESS!

10:14.655 --> 10:15.489
NOW CLIMB IN THERE
AND TAKE IT OFF HER.

10:15.573 --> 10:16.907
- ME?

10:16.991 --> 10:18.576
- YEAH. I GOTTA
TAKE OFF MY CLOTHES

10:18.659 --> 10:20.077
TO SWITCH WITH HER.
PLUS, YOU'RE WEARING PANTS.

10:20.161 --> 10:21.662
HURRY UP.
- WHY?

10:21.746 --> 10:23.039
SHE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.832
- SOMEONE MIGHT COME IN.

10:24.915 --> 10:27.418
- OH, WHAT THE HELL.

10:27.501 --> 10:29.337
HAPPY NON-ANNIVERSARY
TO ME!

10:29.420 --> 10:31.756
- OH, SWEETIE...

10:31.839 --> 10:34.592
MAYBE CLIMBING IN A COFFIN
WILL CHEER YOU UP.

10:37.678 --> 10:39.347
- EWW.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.057
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO THIS?

10:41.140 --> 10:43.392
JUST EASE IN, LIKE YOU'RE
GOING IN A HOT TUB.

10:46.312 --> 10:49.065
- EWW! OH...

10:49.148 --> 10:52.276
EWW.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.112
- OH, MY GOD.

10:55.196 --> 10:56.572
WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING?

10:56.655 --> 10:59.408
- THE DEAD LADY HAS ON
MY MAGIC DRESS.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.161
- SO YOU'RE SWAPPING DRESSES
WITH A CORPSE

11:02.244 --> 11:04.622
WITHOUT LOCKING THE DOOR?
UGH, ROOKIES!

11:04.705 --> 11:08.793
HEY, I FOUND
MY <i> SOAP OPERA DIGEST.</i>

11:08.876 --> 11:11.420
OH, WOW, AND I HAD
TOTALLY FORGOTTEN ABOUT

11:11.504 --> 11:12.463
THIS INTERVIEW.

11:12.546 --> 11:14.715
"VICTORIA CHASING THE DREAM."

11:14.799 --> 11:15.758
- DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
READ THAT LATER

11:15.841 --> 11:16.884
AND GIVE ME A HAND?

11:16.967 --> 11:18.386
- OH, ABSOLUTELY.

11:18.469 --> 11:20.096
OH, LISTEN TO THIS.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.556
"IN A FEW SHORT YEARS,
VICTORIA CHASE

"HAS BECOME

11:37.071 --> 11:39.281
- OH, MY SNAP IS STUCK!

11:39.365 --> 11:40.950
- OF COURSE, I JUST
SAID THOSE THINGS, YOU KNOW,

11:41.033 --> 11:42.451
TO CONFUSE THE COMPETITION.

11:42.535 --> 11:43.452
YOU KNOW, I FIGURED
THERE'D BE SOME

11:43.536 --> 11:45.287
YOUNG ACTRESSES OUT THERE

PORK THEMSELVES

11:47.706 --> 11:50.292
RIGHT OUT OF THE BUSINESS.

11:50.376 --> 11:51.627

IS GLUED ON.

11:51.710 --> 11:52.795
VICTORIA, HELP!

11:52.878 --> 11:54.088
- OH, I'M SORRY.
OF COURSE.

11:54.171 --> 11:56.424
LET'S SEE, WHERE WAS I?

11:56.507 --> 11:58.634

OH, MY GOD.

12:14.191 --> 12:16.277
I'M SUCH A FAILURE.

12:16.360 --> 12:19.655
I HAVEN'T DONE ANY OF THE THINGS
I SET OUT TO DO.

12:19.738 --> 12:22.324
NO ONE HAS SUNK
AS LOW AS I HAVE.

12:22.408 --> 12:26.662
- YOU DO REALIZE
I'M STRADDLING A DEAD WOMAN?

12:26.745 --> 12:28.998
[pounding on door]
- OH, UH, OCCUPIED!

12:29.081 --> 12:33.711
- WHAT?
I GOTTA GET IN THERE!

12:33.794 --> 12:36.338
- DAMN, TWO LOCKS.

12:36.422 --> 12:40.384
- I'M SORRY, I JUST WANTED
TO PAY MY RESPECTS.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.803
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR CLOTHES?

12:42.887 --> 12:46.974
- OH, I--I WAS
SO OVERCOME WITH GRIEF

12:47.057 --> 12:49.685
THAT I WAS RENDING
MY GARMENTS.

12:49.768 --> 12:52.396
[phony crying]

12:52.480 --> 12:55.232
- DO YOU MIND IF I HAVE
SOME TIME WITH JENNY?

12:55.316 --> 12:57.234
- WHO?
- THE DECEASED.

12:57.318 --> 12:59.028
- OH, OH, THAT JENNY.

12:59.111 --> 13:01.197
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHO YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT

13:01.280 --> 13:04.867
BECAUSE WE WERE SO CLOSE THAT
WE GAVE EACH OTHER NICKNAMES.

13:04.950 --> 13:08.496
I CALLED HER...ROOSTER.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.331
- OKAY.

13:10.414 --> 13:12.541
- DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
COME BACK ANOTHER TIME?

13:12.625 --> 13:14.251
- I DROVE ALL NIGHT
TO BE HERE.

13:14.335 --> 13:16.045
I HAVE TO SEE HER
ONE LAST TIME.

13:16.128 --> 13:17.713
- NO, NO, NO.
- DON'T OPEN THAT!

13:17.796 --> 13:19.548
- WHY?

13:19.632 --> 13:21.509
- UH...
SHE WAS IN AN ACCIDENT

13:21.592 --> 13:23.719
AND WAS HORRIBLY
DISFIGURED.

13:23.802 --> 13:25.054
- WELL, I DON'T CARE.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.555
I HAVE TO SAY GOOD-BYE
FACE TO FACE.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.724
- HOLD IT--
- OH, MY GOD, I--

13:28.807 --> 13:31.560
WOW.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.396
THE UNDERTAKER DID
A WONDERFUL JOB.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.232
IS SHE EVEN DEAD?

13:36.315 --> 13:38.692
OOP. YEP, SHE'S DEAD.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.115
- LOOK AT THOSE
BIG LORIS EYES.

13:45.199 --> 13:48.577
I'LL TICKLE YOU.
[laughter]

13:48.661 --> 13:51.080
- AH...AGAIN?

13:51.163 --> 13:52.540
- WELL, DON'T YOU THINK
WE SHOULD GET BACK

13:52.623 --> 13:53.707
TO THE MURDER
INVESTIGATION?

13:53.791 --> 13:55.459
- OH, YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:55.543 --> 13:58.754
UM, IS THERE A WILL LISTED
IN HER DOCUMENTS?

13:58.837 --> 14:00.714
- NO, NOTHING.

14:00.798 --> 14:05.052
JUST A SCREENPLAY CALLED
<i>HUMMELS: A LOVE STORY.</i>

14:05.135 --> 14:08.430
- OH. THE NURSE MUST HAVE
ERASED THE WILL.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.642
- WELL, THAT MEANS THE NURSE
HAS ACCESS TO THIS COMPUTER.

14:11.725 --> 14:13.227
- YEAH.

14:13.310 --> 14:15.271
YOU KNOW,
I SAW A <i> LAW &amp; ORDER</i> ONE TIME

14:15.354 --> 14:17.606
WHERE THEY LOOKED UP THE
KILLER'S WEB BROWSING HISTORY

14:17.690 --> 14:20.401
AND FOUND INCRIMINATING
SEARCHES,

14:20.484 --> 14:24.280
LIKE HOUSEHOLD POISONS,
HOW TO KILL SOMEONE.

14:24.363 --> 14:28.617
THEY'VE REALLY
DUMBED DOWN THAT SHOW.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.453
- THANKS. I JUST NEED
A LITTLE TIME ALONE WITH HER.

14:31.537 --> 14:34.790
- [loudly]
WE'LL BE RIGHT OUTSIDE!

14:34.873 --> 14:36.458
- ALL RIGHT.

14:42.214 --> 14:45.217
HI, JENNY.
IT'S ME, DAN.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.094
I KNOW IT'S BEEN
A LONG TIME,

14:47.177 --> 14:50.306
BUT I JUST HAD TO
SEE YOU AGAIN.

14:50.389 --> 14:53.309
THERE HASN'T BEEN A DAY
IN THE PAST 50 YEARS

14:53.392 --> 14:56.270
THAT I HAVEN'T REGRETTED
BREAKING OUR ENGAGEMENT.

14:56.353 --> 14:59.565
IT'S THE BIGGEST MISTAKE
I EVER MADE.

14:59.648 --> 15:02.443
CAN YOU FIND IT IN YOUR HEART
TO FORGIVE ME?

15:02.526 --> 15:04.486
- NO!

15:07.906 --> 15:09.908
- JENNY, IS THAT YOU?
- NO!

15:12.369 --> 15:14.705
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THERE?
WHO ARE YOU?

15:14.788 --> 15:16.332
- JOY SCROGGS.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.292
AND SPEAKING
FOR ALL JILTED WOMEN,

15:18.375 --> 15:20.085
YOU ARE NOT FORGIVEN.

15:20.169 --> 15:23.047
- WHO MADE YOU
THEIR SPOKESPERSON?

15:23.130 --> 15:26.508
- TRUST ME, I AM WAY
OVERQUALIFIED FOR THE JOB.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.344
THERE WAS THE GUY
WHO LEFT ME

15:28.427 --> 15:29.470
WHEN I GOT PREGNANT
AS A TEENAGER,

15:29.553 --> 15:31.305
OR THE GUY WHO LEFT ME
AT THE ALTAR.

15:31.388 --> 15:33.015
TAKE YOUR PICK.

15:33.098 --> 15:36.310
- LOOK, YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY MADE
A LOT OF DIFFERENT LIFE CHOICES

15:36.393 --> 15:39.063
THAT LED TO YOU
LYING IN A COFFIN.

15:39.146 --> 15:42.358
BUT YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW MUCH I LOVED THAT WOMAN.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.068
- NOT ENOUGH
TO STICK AROUND.

15:44.151 --> 15:45.986
- JENNY AND I WERE
SUPPOSED TO GET MARRIED,

15:46.070 --> 15:48.030
BUT I CALLED IT OFF
BECAUSE I REALIZED

15:48.113 --> 15:50.032
I COULDN'T GIVE HER
THE LIFE SHE DESERVED.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.492
SHE WAS TOO GOOD FOR ME.

15:51.575 --> 15:53.661
- WELL, DID YOU
TELL HER THAT?

15:53.744 --> 15:55.371
- NO, BECAUSE SHE WOULD HAVE
TRIED TO CONVINCE ME OTHERWISE.

15:55.454 --> 15:56.538
BUT I KNEW THE TRUTH.

15:56.622 --> 15:59.541
THAT'S WHY I DISAPPEARED.

15:59.625 --> 16:00.834
- I WONDER IF THAT WAS THE CASE
WITH THE GUY

16:00.918 --> 16:02.378
WHO LEFT ME AT THE ALTAR.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.505
- OH, ONE LOOK AT YOU,
I CAN TELL

16:04.588 --> 16:06.048
HE WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH
FOR YOU EITHER.

16:06.131 --> 16:08.717
- THANKS.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.386
I FORGIVE YOU.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.554
I--I MEAN I'M SURE
SHE'D FORGIVE YOU.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.098
<i>WE</i> FORGIVE YOU.

16:14.181 --> 16:16.892
- SHE MET SOMEONE ELSE,
YOU KNOW, AFTER ME.

16:16.975 --> 16:19.228
I HEARD FROM MUTUAL FRIENDS
SHE WAS VERY HAPPY.

16:19.311 --> 16:20.688
- THAT'S NICE.

16:20.771 --> 16:23.941
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I THINK
I'LL NEVER GET MARRIED.

16:24.024 --> 16:25.901
- OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT.

16:25.984 --> 16:28.570
BUT IF I MAY SAY SO,

16:28.654 --> 16:32.616
YOU MIGHT BE GOING ABOUT IT
THE WRONG WAY.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.868
MAY I ASK WHAT
YOU WERE DOING?

16:34.952 --> 16:36.578
- THERE WAS A MIX-UP
AT THE DRY CLEANERS.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.622
I WAS TRYING TO GET
MY FRIEND'S DRESS BACK.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.249
- I COULDN'T SEE YOU
AT ALL IN THERE.

16:40.332 --> 16:41.458
HOW'D YOU EVEN FIT?

16:41.542 --> 16:42.960
- I DROPPED OUT OF COLLEGE

16:43.043 --> 16:45.587
TO BECOME
A MAGICIAN'S ASSISTANT.

16:45.671 --> 16:50.134
HE LEFT ME FOR THE GIRL
WHO SWALLOWED THE SWORDS.

16:52.010 --> 16:54.096
- PLEASE COME IN,
EVERYONE.

16:54.179 --> 16:56.098
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- WHERE'S MY DRESS.

16:56.181 --> 16:57.099
- STILL ON THE DEAD WOMAN.

16:57.182 --> 16:59.768
- OH, NO.
OH, NO!

16:59.852 --> 17:02.104
- OH, I KNOW. IT'S BEEN
A SAD DAY FOR ALL OF US.

17:02.187 --> 17:04.272
BUT I JUST TRY
TO REMEMBER--

17:04.356 --> 17:06.608
TO EVERYTHING,
THERE IS A SEASON.

17:06.692 --> 17:10.738
- MINE WAS FALL, 1988,

17:10.820 --> 17:12.948
- OH, IS THAT FROM
MY GRANDMOTHER'S COLLECTION?

17:13.031 --> 17:15.451
- YES. SHE WANTED ME
TO HAVE IT.

17:15.534 --> 17:16.785
- OH. WERE YOU
AND MY GRANDMOTHER CLOSE?

17:16.868 --> 17:19.579
- SHE CALLED HER "ROOSTER."

17:19.663 --> 17:21.165
- WELL, PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE
TO BE THE FIRST

17:21.248 --> 17:22.332
TO SAY A FEW WORDS.

17:22.415 --> 17:25.502
- OH, IMPROV REALLY
ISN'T MY THING.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.128
- JUST SPEAK FROM THE HEART.

17:27.212 --> 17:30.549
SHARE SOME MEMORIES
OF HAPPIER TIMES.

17:34.762 --> 17:39.475
- WHEN WE ARE YOUNG, WE ARE SO
NAIVE AND FULL OF HOPE

17:39.558 --> 17:41.310
WE BELIEVE THAT
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.

17:41.393 --> 17:45.606
AND WE MAKE PLANS
THAT NEVER MATERIALIZE.

17:45.689 --> 17:48.525
AND INSTEAD OF ACCOLADES,
OUR LIVES ARE FULL OF REGRETS.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.821
ALTHOUGH SHE ULTIMATELY
FAILED,

17:52.905 --> 17:56.992
AT LEAST SHE TRIED
TO REACH FOR THAT BRASS RING.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.453
- BUT MY GRANDMOTHER
DIDN'T FAIL.

17:59.536 --> 18:01.830
SHE WAS CHIEF OF SURGERY
AT THE CLEVELAND CLINIC.

18:01.914 --> 18:05.000
- WELL, YEAH,<i> CLEVELAND.</i>

18:06.710 --> 18:09.213
SORRY.

18:09.296 --> 18:12.299
COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO,
OLD FRIEND.

18:14.384 --> 18:18.347
- OKAY, WOULD ANYONE
WHO ACTUALLY KNEW MY GRANDMOTHER

18:18.430 --> 18:20.682
LIKE TO SAY A WORD BEFORE
WE MOVE TO THE CEMETERY?

18:20.766 --> 18:23.227
- I'D LIKE TO.

18:24.895 --> 18:26.688
DR. VAN ALSTYNE WAS
THE KINDEST,

18:26.772 --> 18:28.524
SWEETEST PERSON
I EVER MET.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.025
IT WAS AN HONOR
AND A PRIVILEGE

18:30.108 --> 18:31.485
TO BE HER LIVE-IN NURSE.

18:31.568 --> 18:33.237
- MURDERER!

18:37.616 --> 18:40.035
YOU MADE UP
THAT WHOLE MURDER THING?

18:40.118 --> 18:42.037
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

18:42.120 --> 18:44.164
- I'M SORRY, I WAS JUST
TRYING TO GET YOU AWAY

18:44.248 --> 18:47.167
FROM THOSE SILVER-HAIRED
PRETTY BOYS.

18:47.251 --> 18:52.214
- YOU GARTER-SOCK BLOCKED ME?

18:52.297 --> 18:54.216
- I DIDN'T CALL YOU
AFTER THAT DATE

18:54.299 --> 18:55.425
BECAUSE I WAS SCARED.

18:55.509 --> 18:58.387
MY WIFE HAD JUST
PASSED AWAY,

18:58.470 --> 19:00.389
AND I WASN'T READY
TO MOVE ON.

19:00.472 --> 19:03.517
AND THEN I WAS,
AND YOU WERE ENGAGED,

19:03.600 --> 19:07.104
AND YOUR DEAD HUSBAND
APPEARED, AND...

19:07.187 --> 19:09.731
IT FELT COMPLICATED.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.734
- WELL, WHY DID YOU
COME UP TO ME TODAY?

19:12.818 --> 19:17.239
- BECAUSE AS SOON AS I SAW YOU,
I KNEW I'D MADE A MISTAKE.

19:17.322 --> 19:20.242
IF YOU'RE READY FOR ME,
I'M READY FOR YOU.

19:22.619 --> 19:23.787
- I AM.

19:31.795 --> 19:33.922
- OH, HEY, YOUR NON-ANNIVERSARY
IS ALMOST OVER.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.632
- IT ENDED WHEN
I TALKED TO DAN.

19:35.716 --> 19:38.260
IN FACT,
THIS IS THE LAST YEAR

19:38.343 --> 19:41.221
ON THE NON-ANNIVERSARIES.

19:41.305 --> 19:42.264
IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON.

19:42.347 --> 19:44.099
- BRAVO, JOY.

19:44.182 --> 19:46.852
AND I'M READY TO MOVE ON
FROM THE NAIVE WORDS

19:46.935 --> 19:48.478
OF A SILLY LITTLE GIRL.

19:48.562 --> 19:51.106
YOU KNOW, TV WAS
VERY GOOD TO ME.

19:51.189 --> 19:53.108
AND I'M PROUD
OF THE WORK I'VE DONE.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.735
- GOOD FOR YOU, VICTORIA.

19:54.818 --> 19:56.778
- AND BESIDES, HELEN MIRREN
DIDN'T WIN AN OSCAR

19:56.862 --> 19:58.614
UNTIL SHE WAS 60.

19:58.697 --> 20:02.284
SO THAT MEANS I HAVE, WHAT...
20 YEARS TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.622
- I GUESS I'M GONNA HAVE TO
GIVE UP ALL HOPE

20:06.705 --> 20:08.123
OF EVER SEEING
MY MAGIC DRESS AGAIN.

20:08.206 --> 20:12.252
- YOU KNOW, IT WAS A BURIAL,
NOT A CREMATION.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.504
I'M JUST SAYIN'.

20:16.340 --> 20:19.468
- ELKA, WE'RE GONNA NEED
YOUR SHOVEL.

20:19.551 --> 20:23.805
- THAT'S FOR SOLVING CRIMES,
NOT COMMITTING THEM.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.307
- BUT IT'S MY MAGIC DRESS.

20:25.390 --> 20:26.642
- I'M SORRY SWEETIE,

20:26.725 --> 20:29.519
HONEY BADGER
DON'T GIVE A [bleep]!

20:29.603 --> 20:32.898
- OKAY.
