WEBVTT

00:19.552 --> 00:22.689
[Sharon] Tell our viewers what
the main difference is, in your mind

00:22.756 --> 00:26.426
between Kimi and products
like Siri or Alexa.

00:26.526 --> 00:29.433
[Brad] Well, Sharon, I
will tell you the difference

00:29.457 --> 00:30.730
between Kimi and those

00:30.830 --> 00:33.333
other products you mention
by name. People.

00:33.400 --> 00:37.170
It's our people and their level
of excellence that sets us apart.

00:37.237 --> 00:40.106
The voice interpolation on Kimi
is a perfect example.

00:40.206 --> 00:42.812
We don't have an algorithm
trying to figure out what

00:42.836 --> 00:44.210
you said or what you meant.

00:44.277 --> 00:47.280
We have actual people
analyzing Kimi requests

00:47.380 --> 00:49.952
so we can continually
update our understanding

00:49.976 --> 00:51.284
of how you communicate,

00:51.384 --> 00:53.453
who you are, what you want.

00:53.553 --> 00:55.388
So you're listening
to everything?

00:55.455 --> 00:59.294
No. Not at all. We are flagging
miscommunication so Kimi

00:59.318 --> 01:01.127
can better understand you.

01:01.227 --> 01:03.063
And we do this every day.

01:03.129 --> 01:05.296
Think of it this way. Kimi
understands you better

01:05.319 --> 01:06.533
today than it did yesterday

01:06.599 --> 01:08.068
because of our people.

01:08.134 --> 01:09.803
Is that efficient?

01:09.903 --> 01:12.249
It's actually the fastest
way to get better fast,

01:12.273 --> 01:13.440
if that makes any sense.

01:13.540 --> 01:16.242
The bottom line is,
it's working.

01:16.309 --> 01:19.279
You pushed for the Amygdala
Corporation to go public,

01:19.379 --> 01:23.283
the idea, the timing, mostly
yours. How are you feeling?

01:23.383 --> 01:24.651
I feel great.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.786
I've been saying since I
was brought in two years ago,

01:26.886 --> 01:28.788
Kimi is the future
of this company.

01:28.888 --> 01:31.391
It just seemed obvious to me,
and the board agrees.

01:31.458 --> 01:34.828
But talk to me in a week, after
the IPO, if you'll give me the time.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.830
[Sharon] I absolutely will.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.156
Bradley Hasling, CEO of
the Amygdala Corporation,

01:39.180 --> 01:40.333
thank you for joining us.

01:40.433 --> 01:42.168
We know it's early
there in Seattle.

01:52.445 --> 01:53.913
Oh, Jess.

01:53.980 --> 01:55.648
- [door closes]
- I was up.

01:59.285 --> 02:00.987
I forgot you had Sharon.

02:02.021 --> 02:03.823
- Is he awake?
- No.

02:03.923 --> 02:05.792
I'll do it.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.293
Did she ask you how much
you would pocket?

02:07.360 --> 02:09.863
Oh, she knows
I wouldn't answer that.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.632
Where'd they set
the share price? Twenty-eight?

02:14.934 --> 02:15.935
Thirty-one.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.106
Which would put us
north of...

02:20.173 --> 02:21.808
I can't count that high.

02:24.110 --> 02:25.378
[sighs]

02:25.478 --> 02:27.213
[cell phone vibrating]

02:35.688 --> 02:37.157
Yes?

02:37.223 --> 02:39.659
[Rivas on phone] You can
transfer the second payment now.

02:42.061 --> 02:43.329
[whispers] Jesus.

02:45.064 --> 02:46.232
Okay.

02:47.367 --> 02:49.636
And no chance of discovery?

02:50.336 --> 02:51.971
Of her? No.

02:56.576 --> 02:58.344
You there?

02:58.411 --> 03:00.580
[smacks lips]
You'll have it within the hour.

03:13.326 --> 03:15.395
[music playing]

04:29.802 --> 04:32.338
- Kimi.
- [Kimi] I'm here!

04:32.438 --> 04:33.506
What time is it?

04:33.606 --> 04:37.176
It's 7:26 a.m.,
Pacific Daylight Time.

04:38.077 --> 04:39.579
You're gonna be late.

04:48.454 --> 04:51.024
[electric toothbrush buzzing]

04:52.458 --> 04:53.926
[moans]

05:05.972 --> 05:09.088
Well, today will be the sixth
consecutive day of protests

05:09.112 --> 05:10.143
over the city's

05:10.209 --> 05:11.944
so-called Homeless Safe Zones.

05:12.011 --> 05:14.380
The demonstrations
and counter-demonstrations

05:14.480 --> 05:17.517
were centered in the downtown
area near official buildings...

05:17.617 --> 05:19.986
- [panting] Kimi.
- [Kimi] I'm here!

05:20.053 --> 05:23.056
Mute TV, play "Oxytocin."

05:23.156 --> 05:25.892
["Oxytocin" playing]

10:35.635 --> 10:37.503
Oh, no.

10:37.603 --> 10:42.208
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:44.877 --> 10:47.046
[line ringing]

10:47.146 --> 10:48.347
[Marcos on phone] Hello?

10:48.447 --> 10:50.549
Marcos, it's Angela.
I thought we had an agreement.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.349
I know, but I got the carpet
guy coming, and the tackless

10:53.373 --> 10:54.620
strip went down all wrong.

10:54.687 --> 10:56.055
I just need
a couple of hours.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.623
I get it,
I have deadlines too,

10:57.690 --> 11:00.726
which is why we agreed 9:00
a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays,

11:00.826 --> 11:03.329
10:00 to 5:00 on Saturdays,
and never on Sundays.

11:03.396 --> 11:06.065
- Please don't do that.
- Do what?

11:06.165 --> 11:09.284
Say the same thing over
and over again until I can't

11:09.308 --> 11:11.137
take it anymore and I give up.

11:11.203 --> 11:14.140
All I'm doing
is reminding you

11:14.206 --> 11:17.743
that you said 9:00 a.m.
to 6:00 p.m. on weekdays,

11:17.843 --> 11:19.905
- 10:00 to 5:00 on
Saturdays, and never on...

11:19.929 --> 11:20.813
- Okay! Okay, okay.

11:23.983 --> 11:25.418
Hold the work, guys.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.687
Try a wide putty knife
to get the strips up,

11:27.753 --> 11:29.889
and don't use
a nail gun next time.

11:29.989 --> 11:32.258
[Marcos on phone] Whoa,
what are you, in the business?

11:34.593 --> 11:36.429
My dad was.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.763
He did my place.

11:38.998 --> 11:40.733
Maybe I should talk to him.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.436
You can't.

11:43.536 --> 11:46.906
Just let me know whenever
you're gonna go out, will you?

11:47.006 --> 11:48.574
Yep. Thanks. Bye.

11:55.247 --> 11:58.084
- [woman on stream] Kimi.
- [Kimi on stream] I'm here!

11:58.184 --> 12:02.021
[woman] Put more kitchen paper
in the cart for next time.

12:02.088 --> 12:06.025
[Kimi] One possibility is Green
Kitchen, on Decatur Street.

12:06.092 --> 12:09.361
[woman] No!
I need more kitchen paper.

12:20.639 --> 12:23.109
- [girl on stream] Kimi.
- [Kimi on stream] I'm here!

12:23.209 --> 12:25.578
[girl] Play "Me,"
Taylor Swift.

12:25.644 --> 12:28.948
[Kimi] Creating personalized
station of Taylor Swift songs.

12:29.048 --> 12:32.051
[girl] No! I just
want to hear "Me!"

12:32.118 --> 12:33.719
[Kimi] I'm listening.

12:33.786 --> 12:35.499
- [girl] Play...
- [Kimi] Tell me

12:35.523 --> 12:36.589
what's on your mind.

12:45.498 --> 12:48.100
- [boy on stream] Hey, Kimi.
- [Kimi on stream] I'm here!

12:48.167 --> 12:49.835
[boy] You're a peckerwood.

12:49.935 --> 12:53.572
[Kimi] I don't know what you
mean by "You're a peckerwood."

12:53.639 --> 12:56.976
[boy laughing] It means
you're a big wooden dick.

13:17.696 --> 13:20.166
[video call line ringing]

13:24.703 --> 13:28.040
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi. Do you have time to talk?

13:28.140 --> 13:31.210
Um, a little. What's wrong?

13:31.310 --> 13:34.547
What? Nothing.
I don't know, nothing. I...

13:36.682 --> 13:38.851
Is there something specific?

13:39.852 --> 13:41.821
No.

13:41.887 --> 13:44.323
I'm sorry I bothered you. God.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.560
Okay. Can we start over?

13:47.660 --> 13:49.195
Good morning, my darling.

13:51.330 --> 13:54.066
[sighs] So, you know the guy
from across the street?

13:55.835 --> 13:57.837
Yes.

13:57.903 --> 14:00.752
I'm not sure I approve of
you waving in the window

14:00.776 --> 14:02.341
like a hooker in Amsterdam,

14:02.408 --> 14:04.710
but, uh, I know who you mean.

14:04.810 --> 14:08.581
Mom, it was lockdown.
Everyone was in the window.

14:09.882 --> 14:11.183
What about the guy?

14:13.586 --> 14:15.888
I asked him to meet me
for breakfast.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.491
Out?

14:20.526 --> 14:22.061
- Good!
- No.

14:22.828 --> 14:24.330
I didn't... I didn't go,

14:24.396 --> 14:27.099
but I tried.

14:30.102 --> 14:33.160
I don't know what you
want me to say, other than

14:33.184 --> 14:34.740
the things I always say.

14:34.840 --> 14:36.942
I don't want you
to say anything. I don't...

14:38.010 --> 14:40.045
Did you try that Turn2Me group?

14:40.846 --> 14:42.348
[sighs]

14:42.414 --> 14:43.916
Okay.

14:44.016 --> 14:45.751
- The Zoom one?
- Yes.

14:45.851 --> 14:49.088
- Roman read about.
- I know the one. Please stop.

14:50.022 --> 14:53.025
Oh, God. I would love to.

14:54.193 --> 14:55.261
Okay. Bye, Mom.

15:28.627 --> 15:31.063
[dramatic music playing]

15:36.936 --> 15:38.570
[Darius over computer] Angela?

15:40.506 --> 15:42.241
Angela? Hello?

15:43.776 --> 15:45.945
Do you hear me, Angela?

15:47.146 --> 15:48.314
[Angela] Yeah.

15:48.414 --> 15:50.849
- [Darius] Did you find it?
- [Angela] Yeah!

15:50.950 --> 15:54.520
[Darius] The black sigma
repeater with the six inputs! Yeah?

15:54.620 --> 15:58.624
[Angela] No, yeah, I know,
but I think I had a bad cable too.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.092
[Darius] Ah, okay.

16:02.194 --> 16:04.964
- All right, rebooting now.
- [Darius] Okay.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.702
Thanks, Darius.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.770
[Darius] Anything
for you, Hotness.

16:11.837 --> 16:14.039
You can't say
that shit anymore, Darius.

16:14.139 --> 16:17.810
Ah, this is Romania.
MeToo is like 50 years away.

16:17.876 --> 16:19.278
Stay on, let's have a drink.

16:19.345 --> 16:21.380
Isn't it like 6:00
in the morning for you?

16:21.480 --> 16:23.983
Oh, is it? I didn't notice.

16:24.049 --> 16:25.484
Thanks for the help.

16:25.551 --> 16:26.785
Please don't leave me.
No! Don't...

18:16.795 --> 18:18.230
You didn't buzz downstairs.

18:18.297 --> 18:21.567
- Somebody was coming out.
- You're still supposed to buzz.

18:21.633 --> 18:23.669
But if somebody's coming out and
you know I'm on my way, then why...

18:23.769 --> 18:26.805
- You have to buzz.
- Okay. Okay. Sorry.

- Yes. [panting]
- [Terry] Oof.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.301
I lied.

18:57.603 --> 18:59.204
I actually don't work
for the cable company.

18:59.304 --> 19:02.708
- [chuckling] Oh, great.
- Sorry.

19:02.808 --> 19:05.310

in the D.A.'s office.

19:05.377 --> 19:07.112

19:07.179 --> 19:08.981

19:18.490 --> 19:20.559
When were you
at the waterfront?

19:20.659 --> 19:21.894
[Angela] What are you
looking at?

19:22.561 --> 19:24.396
Your Instagram.

19:24.496 --> 19:26.298
- You ate at The Pink Door?
- [door opens]

19:26.798 --> 19:27.866
No.

19:27.966 --> 19:29.568
You wrote here you did.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.570
I just liked the picture.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.840
Why would you write,
"Oh, my God, so delicious,"

19:34.907 --> 19:36.675
if you've never
been there before?

19:45.484 --> 19:48.153
You know that spot
used to be Arturo's?

19:48.220 --> 19:50.856
- No.
- With the red awning.

19:50.923 --> 19:53.659
It's just right across the
street from the old guitar store.

19:54.893 --> 19:56.328
Vaguely. Yeah.

19:56.395 --> 19:58.864
- It's a Thai place now.
- Is it good?

19:58.931 --> 20:01.066
I don't know,
they don't do takeout.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.101
Sickos.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.904
The guy in the lobby said it's
the best Thai food he ever had.

20:06.004 --> 20:08.077
Why can't things just be
good? Why do things always

20:08.101 --> 20:09.007
have to be "the best."

20:11.376 --> 20:13.011
I thought I'd try it.

20:13.078 --> 20:14.446
"This is the best
Mobil QuickMart

20:14.546 --> 20:17.783
on the entire West Coast
of the United States."

20:17.883 --> 20:20.118
I'm just throwing it
out there.

20:20.219 --> 20:23.355
Look, we could go right at
6:00, as soon as they open,

20:24.723 --> 20:26.058
before anybody's there.

20:27.359 --> 20:29.294
It would just be me and you.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.530
The server
ain't even came in yet.

20:32.864 --> 20:35.100
We could yell our order
straight to the cook.

20:38.704 --> 20:40.205
Never mind.

20:43.642 --> 20:45.143
[washer beeps]

20:55.087 --> 20:56.922
[Terry] I'm sorry.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.991
[Angela] You promised
you wouldn't do that.

20:59.091 --> 21:02.160
I know, but you were trying
this morning with the food truck.

21:04.763 --> 21:08.667
I brought that up, that was
my suggestion, on my terms.

21:08.767 --> 21:11.937
[Terry] Okay, okay.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.839
Look, I don't know
how much longer I can...

21:13.939 --> 21:16.141
I didn't get through my
streams. I have work tonight.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.581
[Terry] Exhausting.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.310
- Kimi.
- [Kimi] I'm here!

22:26.511 --> 22:28.513
Open next stream

Ah!

27:51.670 --> 27:52.971
Fuck.

27:57.542 --> 28:00.378
[dentist] Can you turn a little
left, please? Toward the light?

28:00.478 --> 28:01.413
[Angela] Mmm-hmm.

28:01.513 --> 28:02.981
Okay, using your pinky finger,

28:03.048 --> 28:05.850
can you feel along the
outer ridge of the gum line?

28:06.918 --> 28:08.687
Yeah.

28:08.753 --> 28:11.019
Okay, now feel that same
ridge, but on the other side,

28:11.043 --> 28:11.890
for the right molar.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.059
Okay.

28:14.159 --> 28:15.727
Do you notice any difference?

28:17.562 --> 28:19.731
Yeah, the left one's swollen.

28:19.831 --> 28:21.666
Soft or hard tissue?

28:22.734 --> 28:23.868
Hard.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.404
You need to come in.

28:26.504 --> 28:30.075
Angela, your gum is swollen
and inflamed with red streaks.

28:30.175 --> 28:31.109
You may have an abscess.

28:31.209 --> 28:33.111
Can't you just call in
an antibiotic?

28:33.211 --> 28:36.114
I could, but it'll come back.
We need to do a root canal.

28:37.215 --> 28:39.451
I take perfect care
of my teeth.

28:40.752 --> 28:43.288
You grind. You cracked it.
It happens.

28:43.388 --> 28:47.625
I take perfect care of my teeth
so that I don't need to come in.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.608
I understand. I
thought things had

28:49.632 --> 28:52.030
improved for you
in this... in this area.

28:52.097 --> 28:55.300
Yeah. Well, COVID was a
little bit of a setback. So...

28:56.234 --> 28:57.736
I... I understand that.

28:57.802 --> 28:59.571
And I know
this is difficult for you.

28:59.637 --> 29:00.772
You don't know.

29:02.307 --> 29:03.742
[sighing]
No, I guess I don't know.

29:03.808 --> 29:05.643
What I do know
is that an abscessed tooth

29:05.744 --> 29:07.894
is a magic carpet for bacteria
to enter the bloodstream

29:07.918 --> 29:08.747
and go to your brain.

29:08.813 --> 29:11.149
Please just call in the
prescription to the regular place.

29:11.249 --> 29:12.817
And maybe
some painkillers, okay?

29:12.917 --> 29:15.253
I'm not prescribing opiates
for a toothache

29:15.320 --> 29:16.821
you're perfectly capable
of treating.

29:16.921 --> 29:21.659
I am not capable of treating it
and you know it.

29:21.760 --> 29:22.660
[dentist sighs]

29:24.395 --> 29:26.965
I can't come to you. I would
need too much equipment.

29:27.065 --> 29:28.933
Please just call it in.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.902
The antibiotic only.

29:30.969 --> 29:32.103
But you're making a mistake.

29:32.170 --> 29:33.905
Yeah, okay. Thanks.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.751

30:25.890 --> 30:27.559
[chime as call answered]

30:27.659 --> 30:29.194
Why would you
send me that stream?

30:29.294 --> 30:31.996
I have told everybody not
to send me things like that.

30:32.063 --> 30:33.998
And especially
a week before the IPO.

30:34.065 --> 30:36.067
I thought it might
have been a crime.

30:36.701 --> 30:38.036
Delete it.

30:38.136 --> 30:39.904
Did you hear me? I thought
it might have been a crime.

30:40.004 --> 30:42.640
Yeah, the devices
pick up things. Lots of things.

30:42.707 --> 30:44.976
And our policy
is it's not our business.

30:45.043 --> 30:49.247
Aren't we legally obligated? Because
of the Amazon Arkansas thing?

30:49.347 --> 30:51.983
Do you know how long that court
case was? That was two years.

30:52.050 --> 30:53.852
[children shouting]

30:53.918 --> 30:55.794
And that was a murder.
Trust me, Angela, we do not

30:55.818 --> 30:56.654
want our own Arkansas.

30:56.721 --> 30:58.690
I think this might
have been sexual assault.

30:58.756 --> 31:03.094
Don't... No. Don't say that. You
don't know that. It was an argument.

31:03.194 --> 31:04.896
I have a very strong feeling.

31:05.530 --> 31:06.698
Based on what?

31:06.764 --> 31:07.765
[children shouting]

31:07.866 --> 31:10.168
Based on my
very strong feeling.

31:11.069 --> 31:13.771
Okay. Just skip this one.

31:13.872 --> 31:16.841
I can't do that. I clear my
list. I always clear my list.

31:16.908 --> 31:18.905
Yes, I know that, and
it's one of the things

31:18.929 --> 31:20.178
that I like best about you.

31:20.245 --> 31:23.081
So here's what you do. You
just mark this degraded audio

31:23.181 --> 31:24.427
- and delete it, and
then you'll be clear.

31:24.451 --> 31:25.083
- [children shouting]

31:25.183 --> 31:28.119
Will you please,
please shut up?

31:28.219 --> 31:29.921
I am trying to work!

31:31.055 --> 31:32.557
What if this woman
needs help?

31:32.624 --> 31:34.926
[sighs] We have
no idea who she is.

31:35.026 --> 31:36.394
I have the stream number.

31:36.461 --> 31:38.229
Yeah, but those
are randomly assigned.

31:38.296 --> 31:40.565
She's totally anonymous,
that's the whole point.

31:41.466 --> 31:43.368
Why did I only get a partial?

31:44.802 --> 31:46.938
There was no wake word.
How did the Kimi unit turn on?

31:47.038 --> 31:48.139
[Kimi] I'm here!

31:48.239 --> 31:49.641
Kimi, turn off.

31:51.042 --> 31:52.944
Okay, what about
the device number?

31:53.044 --> 31:55.213
Can we access
the user account from that?

31:55.280 --> 31:57.615
No. I don't have access
to those accounts.

31:58.249 --> 31:59.384
Who does?

31:59.450 --> 32:01.252
[children shouting]

32:01.319 --> 32:03.721
- Mrs. Chowdhury might.
- Who?

32:03.788 --> 32:06.758
Natalie Chowdhury, she's the
head of Organic Interpolation.

32:06.824 --> 32:09.961
She's in Seattle,
in a, uh, tech hub someplace.

32:10.061 --> 32:11.729
Okay. What's her email?

32:11.796 --> 32:15.400
Don't email, you infant.
Call her.

32:16.301 --> 32:17.802
Okay, what's her number?

32:17.902 --> 32:20.772
Listen, don't email
anybody about this.

32:20.838 --> 32:23.107
I'm telling you, you do not
want the aggravation.

32:23.174 --> 32:24.409
They hate
this kind of thing.

32:24.475 --> 32:25.843
What is her number?

32:25.944 --> 32:27.979
I don't know. Look it up
in the company directory.

32:28.079 --> 32:32.250
And, hey, don't send me anything
like this ever again. Please.

32:32.317 --> 32:36.254
Hey, you guys, I swear to God!
You are driving me insane!

32:36.321 --> 32:40.525
I am going to take everything you
love and put it in a garbage bag!

32:40.625 --> 32:43.161
- [woman on phone] Organics.
- Hi, may I sp...

32:43.261 --> 32:45.863
Is this the number
for Ms. Chowdhury?

32:45.964 --> 32:48.933
Ms. Chowdhury's not in
just now. May I take a message?

32:49.000 --> 32:52.870
Yes, my name is Angela Childs.
I'm a voice stream interpreter.

32:52.971 --> 32:56.708
And I believe I may have heard
a crime on one of the streams.

32:56.808 --> 32:59.911
I see. Amygdala takes
evidence of wrongdoing

32:59.935 --> 33:01.879
very seriously, Ms. Childs.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.110
If you could please
write a detailed summary

33:04.134 --> 33:05.616
and email it to Ms. Chowdhury,

33:05.683 --> 33:07.986
she will return your call
by the end of day.

33:10.555 --> 33:14.826
Uh, I'd rather
just tell her about it.

33:14.892 --> 33:17.295
Amygdala takes this
very seriously, Ms. Childs,

33:17.362 --> 33:19.964
and we do ask that you start
with a written report.

33:22.066 --> 33:24.302
[line ringing]

33:24.369 --> 33:26.838
- [woman on phone] Organics.
- Hello, this is Angela Childs.

33:26.904 --> 33:30.174
I was just wondering
if Ms. Chowdhury was in yet?

33:30.241 --> 33:33.911
Ms. Chowdhury's not in just
now. Did you send the report?

33:34.012 --> 33:37.715
No, not yet, but I will. Do you have
any sense of when she'll be back?

33:37.815 --> 33:39.751
Hello again, this is Angela
Childs calling. I was wondering...

33:39.851 --> 33:42.653
[woman on phone] Yes, Ms.
Childs, I recognized the number.

33:42.720 --> 33:45.156
I'm afraid
she's still not free.

33:45.223 --> 33:49.727
It might be easier if you just
came in. You're in Seattle, I see?

33:49.827 --> 33:51.396
Yes.

33:51.496 --> 33:54.365
Fine, just come down to
the office in about an hour.

33:54.432 --> 33:56.601
Bring the recording, and if
she isn't available, I'll...

33:56.701 --> 33:58.002
I can't come there.

33:59.070 --> 34:00.605
May I ask why not?

34:01.906 --> 34:04.776
Yes, because
it's not convenient.

34:06.244 --> 34:09.614
But you can tell her
that I will be

34:09.714 --> 34:12.417
available all day. Okay?

34:12.516 --> 34:14.685
Okay, Ms. Childs, I will do.

34:16.087 --> 34:17.255
Thank you.

34:29.534 --> 34:31.202
[line ringing]

34:37.975 --> 34:39.444
[Terry on phone] Hey.

34:39.543 --> 34:41.813
Hey, Prosecutor,
what you doing?

34:41.913 --> 34:43.781
I can't really talk right now.

34:43.880 --> 34:45.583
Make it fast. What's up?

34:45.650 --> 34:48.386
Okay, sorry. Um,
I just had a quick question.

34:48.453 --> 34:52.389
Um, if I heard a crime
on one of the streams,

34:53.056 --> 34:54.125
who do I tell?

34:54.225 --> 34:55.659
FBI.

34:55.760 --> 34:59.430
The Internet is interstate.
What'd you hear?

34:59.497 --> 35:02.233
I'll, um,
I'll tell you later...

35:02.300 --> 35:04.102
When you come over?

35:06.504 --> 35:09.907
- Maybe around 8:00-ish?
- [construction grinding]

35:11.776 --> 35:13.177
I don't know.

35:15.513 --> 35:17.014
I'll text you.

35:17.582 --> 35:18.516
Okay.

35:38.803 --> 35:40.138
[computer call ringing]

35:42.874 --> 35:44.208

35:44.308 --> 35:46.777
Hey, Hotness!

35:46.844 --> 35:49.147
Seriously, Darius,
they will fire you for that.

35:49.213 --> 35:52.183
I invite them to fuck off!

35:52.283 --> 35:54.952
- Are you drunk?
- Yes. What do you want?

What's a freq tab D 26,
26 request?

35:58.890 --> 36:00.391
Why?

36:00.491 --> 36:02.193
It was on a stream yesterday.

36:02.860 --> 36:03.961
Ah!

36:04.028 --> 36:06.063
A freq tab means a Kimi unit's
been tabbed...

36:06.164 --> 36:08.332
- [Kimi] I'm here!
- Kimi, turn off!

36:08.399 --> 36:11.536
for frequent interpolation
and interpretation.

36:11.636 --> 36:15.072
D 26, 26 means it's not
the algorithm picking it,

36:15.173 --> 36:19.076
it's the code of the person
requesting it. Why?

36:19.177 --> 36:21.192
- How do I find out
who requested it?

36:21.216 --> 36:21.879
- You can't.

36:21.979 --> 36:23.347
- Can you?
- Maybe.

36:23.414 --> 36:26.517
I don't know. I've never tried.
I'd need the device number.

36:30.254 --> 36:32.642
Just sent it to you. But
you can't access the user

36:32.666 --> 36:34.025
data with the device number.

36:34.091 --> 36:37.562
Of course you can.
Who says you can't?

36:37.662 --> 36:39.230
- Someone at corporate.
- Well, they lied.

36:39.330 --> 36:41.199
If you have the device number
and the admin code,

36:41.265 --> 36:43.234
you can hear every recording
that Kimi's ever made...

36:43.334 --> 36:44.702
- [Kimi] I'm here!
- ...if you want.

36:44.769 --> 36:47.505
Kimi, turn the fuck off!

36:47.572 --> 36:49.840
- [Darius exhales]
- Do you have an admin code?

36:49.907 --> 36:54.111
Yes, but I'm not gonna give you
mine. You'd need a dummy code.

36:54.212 --> 36:57.281
- Will you make me one?
- Why the fuck would I do that?

36:57.381 --> 36:59.617
You know, you only ever call me
when you need a favor.

36:59.717 --> 37:03.955
And your Instagram is bullshit,
by the way. I data scraped.

37:04.055 --> 37:08.693
It's full of reposts and lies. I
don't even know who you are, really.

37:10.561 --> 37:11.529
[gulps] Ah!

37:11.596 --> 37:13.731
Who makes
fake life online, huh?

37:13.798 --> 37:17.134
Literally everyone. Can you make
me a dummy admin code, please?

37:17.235 --> 37:19.036
Why should I?

37:20.738 --> 37:24.041
- Because I heard something bad.
- You hear lots bad.

37:24.108 --> 37:25.610
No, not like this.

37:25.710 --> 37:27.778
And, trust me, I know bad. I
used to moderate for Facebook.

37:27.878 --> 37:30.147
[incoming call ringing
on laptop]

37:30.248 --> 37:31.315
[Angela sighs]

37:32.383 --> 37:33.985
Shit. I gotta go.
Send me the code?

37:34.085 --> 37:37.922
This is last favor, fake Hotness.
You're too weird, even for me.

37:37.989 --> 37:38.889
Thanks. Bye.

37:38.956 --> 37:39.824
[hangs up]

37:40.658 --> 37:42.460
Hi.

37:42.560 --> 37:45.296
Where are you? We had a
session starting 20 minutes ago.

37:45.396 --> 37:47.315
- I am... Something came
up at work that I, uh...

37:47.339 --> 37:48.332
- [cell phone text chime]

37:51.269 --> 37:52.837
Angela?

37:52.937 --> 37:55.773
Yeah. That I, uh, just got
a little wrapped up in.

37:55.840 --> 37:57.987
- "Wrapped up?" What
do you mean, wrapped up?

37:58.011 --> 37:59.176
-[cell phone text chime]

37:59.277 --> 38:03.581
I just, um, couldn't stop
thinking about it.

38:03.648 --> 38:06.817
Angela? What are you doing?
This is rude.

38:07.818 --> 38:09.520
Yeah, sorry. I'm sorry.

38:09.620 --> 38:11.779
- Uh, I was just looking
at the... the thing.

38:11.803 --> 38:13.024
- [cell phone text chime]

38:13.124 --> 38:15.092
Some new data
has come to light.

38:15.159 --> 38:17.829
Okay. This is the sort
of thing we've wanted

38:17.853 --> 38:19.463
to leave behind, isn't it?

38:19.530 --> 38:23.000
Thinking about something
to the exclusion of all else,

38:23.100 --> 38:24.969
even when you've been
asked to stop?

38:25.036 --> 38:28.205
Like the virus,
like Evergreen...

38:28.306 --> 38:32.543
Wow! Wow, just leaping in
with both feet today, huh?

38:34.145 --> 38:37.381
What is this work thing?
Why pursue this?

38:37.481 --> 38:39.517
I heard something and I...

38:40.518 --> 38:42.353
I think a woman
might need help.

38:44.655 --> 38:46.157
Maybe she does.

38:46.223 --> 38:50.061
Or maybe you've just replaced
your real stresses with this.

38:51.395 --> 38:52.997
Do you think
it's time to talk about it?

38:53.064 --> 38:56.067
- About what?
- What happened to you at Evergreen.

38:56.167 --> 38:59.637
How long you're going to let it
color the rest of your life.

38:59.704 --> 39:01.839
- [construction grinding]
- Yeah.

39:02.707 --> 39:05.409
Yeah. I think you're right.

39:05.509 --> 39:10.581
And at what point are you going
to say "Enough. My life starts now?"

39:10.681 --> 39:14.418
Yep. Yep. You are...

39:14.518 --> 39:16.821
You're 100% right, Dr. Burns.

39:16.887 --> 39:18.589
Thank you. Thank you.

39:18.689 --> 39:21.022
And I'm realizing the
thing that I really want

39:21.046 --> 39:22.493
to be able to do is, like...

39:24.862 --> 39:26.163
[sighs]

39:29.433 --> 39:31.869
[dramatic music]

40:30.094 --> 40:32.396
- [Samantha on recording] Kimi.
- [Kimi] I'm here!

40:32.463 --> 40:33.798
[Samantha] Call Brad mobile.

40:35.766 --> 40:38.169
- [Samantha on recording] Kimi.
- [Kimi] I'm here!

40:38.269 --> 40:41.172
[Samantha] Play "Oxytocin"
by Billie Eilish.

40:41.272 --> 40:44.508

[Samantha] Open recording.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.461
[footsteps on recording]

41:09.133 --> 41:12.036
[Brad on recording] You have
to fucking stop this.

41:12.136 --> 41:13.437
[Samantha] You know
what you did.

41:13.504 --> 41:15.372
[Brad] You don't know
what you're talking about.

41:15.473 --> 41:17.208
[Samantha] I don't know
what I'm talking about?

41:17.308 --> 41:20.611
- [Brad] It wasn't like that.
- [Samantha] Admit what you did.

41:21.812 --> 41:22.813
[Brad] I thought
it was a fucking game.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.882
[Samantha] Bullshit!

41:24.982 --> 41:26.383
You raped me.

41:26.484 --> 41:28.385
[Brad] You're insane. I...
I don't know what you want.

41:28.486 --> 41:31.121
[Samantha sniffles] I want
people to know who you really are.

41:31.188 --> 41:33.724
I want them to know
you're a rapist!

41:33.824 --> 41:36.193
[Brad] Stop it!
And stop calling my house.

41:36.293 --> 41:39.864
[Samantha] No, Brad.
No. I won't be discarded.

41:39.964 --> 41:41.065
[Brad] This is over.

41:41.165 --> 41:43.334
[Samantha] Oh, no, it isn't.

41:43.400 --> 41:46.470
I know things, Brad.

41:46.537 --> 41:48.405
[Brad] You should
stop talking right now.

41:48.506 --> 41:51.242
[Samantha] People need to know
about your shitty product.

41:51.342 --> 41:55.913
They should know anybody can
hack into it any time they want.

41:56.013 --> 41:59.083
Say goodbye
to your $100 million.

41:59.183 --> 42:01.051
[Brad] You're sick.
Get some help.

42:01.151 --> 42:03.767
- [Samantha] Admit what you did!
- [Brad] Don't you fucking

42:03.791 --> 42:04.655
touch me! You...

42:04.722 --> 42:06.557
[Brad] You ever come
to my house again, I'll...

42:06.657 --> 42:08.592
[Samantha] What?
What are you gonna do?

42:08.692 --> 42:12.429
[Brad] I'm not fucking around
anymore! Stop it! Stop it now.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.765
[Samantha] No, Brad! No, Brad!

42:14.865 --> 42:18.235

43:09.320 --> 43:11.722

Over there. Over there.

43:11.789 --> 43:13.991

- [thug] Lay her down.

43:14.091 --> 43:16.493
[muffled screams]

43:16.594 --> 43:18.996
[Thug] That's it.
Over there. On the ground.

43:19.096 --> 43:21.999
[grunting]

43:22.099 --> 43:23.901
- Watch the spray.
- Yep.

43:23.968 --> 43:27.104

[crying]

44:37.675 --> 44:39.009
[sniffles]

44:43.313 --> 44:44.715
Hello?

44:44.815 --> 44:47.484
[Chowdhury on phone] May I
speak to Ms. Childs, please?

44:52.189 --> 44:54.024
This is she.

44:54.091 --> 44:56.927
It's Natalie Chowdhury,
returning your call.

45:01.065 --> 45:02.566
Are you there?

45:04.702 --> 45:07.905
[crying] Yes. Yes, I'm here.

45:08.005 --> 45:11.275
As I said, it's Natalie
Chowdhury, from Amygdala.

45:11.375 --> 45:15.112
You called me earlier
about, uh, a data stream?

45:15.212 --> 45:17.548
- Several times, I see.
- Yes.

45:17.614 --> 45:21.185
[crying] Yes,
I've heard something.

45:21.251 --> 45:23.520
I've heard
something disturbing.

45:25.255 --> 45:28.292
I see. Well, um...

45:28.392 --> 45:32.429
I am sorry to say that this
does come up from time to time.

45:32.529 --> 45:35.199
And it is not something
I take lightly.

45:35.265 --> 45:37.505
- You've called
exactly the right person.

45:37.529 --> 45:38.268
- [crying]

45:39.403 --> 45:42.139
I... I'll tell you
what let's do.

45:42.239 --> 45:46.477
Let's definitely call the FBI
as soon as possible.

45:46.577 --> 45:49.480
I'm clearing my schedule
for the rest of the day.

45:49.580 --> 45:51.148
Close your files,
come to my office,

45:51.248 --> 45:54.218
and we'll listen
to the recordings together.

45:54.284 --> 45:55.886
We can be joined
by a third party

45:55.953 --> 45:58.822
and you can select
from anyone on my staff.

45:58.922 --> 46:01.725
Then we'll notify
the authorities officially.

46:01.792 --> 46:03.260
Together.

46:03.327 --> 46:07.131
When they come, we'll
play everything for them here.

46:07.231 --> 46:08.799
Does that sound good?

46:10.234 --> 46:11.735
[crying] I'm leaving now.

46:12.803 --> 46:14.004

48:49.059 --> 48:51.094
[dramatic music playing]

49:13.016 --> 49:15.252
Yeah, that's lateral thinking.

49:19.089 --> 49:20.958
No, that's Caracas.

49:22.993 --> 49:24.261
Mmm-hmm.

49:25.262 --> 49:26.363
Blocked.

49:27.297 --> 49:28.598
Mmm-hmm.

49:28.665 --> 49:30.033
September.

49:30.133 --> 49:31.768
[cell phone vibrating]

49:34.871 --> 49:37.174
Everybody keep going.
I'll jump back on in five.

49:37.274 --> 49:38.775
[cell phone vibrating]

49:44.314 --> 49:46.450
This was not our agreement.

49:46.516 --> 49:47.884
[Rivas on phone] No choice.

49:48.618 --> 49:50.020
Why not?

49:50.120 --> 49:52.322
Your friend...

49:52.389 --> 49:53.957
Did you give her a Kimi?

49:55.325 --> 49:56.326
Holy shit.

49:59.863 --> 50:02.632
Unbelievable.

50:02.699 --> 50:07.804
She got unpredictable. Threatening.
I was just keeping an eye on things.

50:09.039 --> 50:11.008
Well, so was she.

50:11.074 --> 50:12.743
I don't understand how...

50:12.843 --> 50:14.911
Tech worker got an algo prompt.

50:15.012 --> 50:17.047
She's on her way
to see Chowdhury.

50:20.250 --> 50:21.351
What now?

50:23.353 --> 50:25.856
How much more cash
can you get?

50:27.691 --> 50:30.394
[dramatic music playing]

50:30.494 --> 50:32.596
[announcer speaking
indistinctly]

51:04.528 --> 51:08.231
[recorded voice on intercom] Remove
eyeglasses and lean into scanner.

51:08.932 --> 51:10.934
Oh, I never, um...

51:11.034 --> 51:15.305
[recorded voice on intercom] Remove
eye glasses and lean into scanner.

51:15.405 --> 51:16.706
Hello?

51:17.574 --> 51:18.875
Hello?

51:29.886 --> 51:33.223
[recorded voice on intercom] Please
use this card to access floor three.

52:13.597 --> 52:15.665
Excuse me.
Ms. Chowdhury's office?

52:15.765 --> 52:17.806
- Um, at the end
of the hall to the left.

52:17.830 --> 52:18.502
- Thanks.

52:25.542 --> 52:27.711
[high-pitched ringing]

52:35.352 --> 52:38.855
Hi. I'm here
to see Ms. Chowdhury.

52:38.955 --> 52:41.558
Ms. Childs.
Yes, she's expecting you.

52:41.658 --> 52:43.727
Can I get you anything?
Are you all right?

52:43.827 --> 52:46.363
- Everything's good. Ms. Childs.
- Hi.

52:46.463 --> 52:48.732
- Hey, come on in.
- I'm fine.

52:51.168 --> 52:52.802
- [Chowdhury] Have a seat.
- [Angela] Thank you.

52:54.971 --> 52:58.375
[exhales sharply] Wow,
that is one hell of a story.

52:58.475 --> 52:59.843
I just...

52:59.910 --> 53:02.212
- Oh!
- Yeah, I thought so too.

53:02.312 --> 53:03.547
Oh!

53:04.714 --> 53:06.483
I'm with you, you know.

53:08.652 --> 53:10.387
- Okay.
- [whispers] Okay.

53:11.555 --> 53:13.723
Can I hear the streams, then?

53:18.862 --> 53:20.096
Oh...

53:21.531 --> 53:22.766
Right now?

53:23.366 --> 53:25.368
Well, yes.

53:27.671 --> 53:29.439
Oh. I...

53:30.874 --> 53:33.109
I, um...

53:33.210 --> 53:36.613
Sorry, I thought... I thought that
you said we would do it in the...

53:36.713 --> 53:38.915
In the presence of the FBI?

53:39.015 --> 53:41.718
That's not exactly
what I said,

53:41.785 --> 53:44.955
but I have to know
what we're dealing with.

53:45.055 --> 53:48.792
We're dealing with what sounds
like a premeditated murder.

53:48.892 --> 53:50.193
How do I know that?

53:50.260 --> 53:52.596
Because I just told you.

53:54.231 --> 53:55.298
Twice now.

53:58.401 --> 54:00.537
- Okay, Angela.
- Yeah?

54:00.604 --> 54:02.647
How about you give me
the device and number,

54:02.671 --> 54:04.140
and I can pull the data myself?

54:04.241 --> 54:09.246
[sighs] Can we please
just call the FBI first?

54:11.748 --> 54:14.417
- [sighs] Angela.
- Yeah?

54:17.587 --> 54:20.863
I understand that you have
taken some mental health

54:20.887 --> 54:22.058
leave in the past.

54:24.761 --> 54:28.932
[stutters] W...
why is that in my file?

54:28.999 --> 54:32.335
Well, it's just to say
that I understand that...

54:32.435 --> 54:33.470
You understand what?

54:33.570 --> 54:35.639
Well, not the specifics
of your case.

54:35.739 --> 54:38.074
- I mean, I would never...
- I was assaulted. I...

54:40.110 --> 54:41.845
I was assaulted...

54:42.946 --> 54:44.147
And...

54:45.849 --> 54:48.184
and the police put me
on trial instead of him.

54:49.786 --> 54:53.356
Wow. That's awful.

54:55.592 --> 54:58.194
[exhales] And under
those circumstances,

54:58.295 --> 55:00.864
I certainly understand
your reluctance.

55:01.965 --> 55:03.466
[sighs]

55:03.533 --> 55:05.702
Are your parents
with us, Angela?

55:10.807 --> 55:12.442
My mother is.

55:13.710 --> 55:16.112
My father died
not long before the incident.

55:18.148 --> 55:19.149
I cannot imagine how that...

55:19.215 --> 55:21.451
I never gave you guys
a retinal scan.

55:22.552 --> 55:23.820
Sorry?

55:23.887 --> 55:25.455
Downstairs. There was
a retinal scanner at the door

55:25.522 --> 55:27.624
and it let me in,
but I never sat for a scan.

55:27.691 --> 55:30.794
Well, we take them off the
video conferences. It's faster.

55:30.860 --> 55:33.129
- But I didn't give permission.
- Sure you did.

55:33.196 --> 55:36.333
It's in the terms and conditions
of the conference software.

55:36.399 --> 55:38.001
Nobody reads those.

55:40.403 --> 55:41.571
Angela...

55:43.473 --> 55:44.974
What are we doing here?

55:46.876 --> 55:50.413
We're waiting for you
to call the FBI?

55:53.550 --> 55:56.086
[chuckles softly] You're right.

55:56.186 --> 56:01.257
[sighs] You're right.
It'll take me two minutes. I...

56:01.358 --> 56:03.326
Okay, I have to get
Mr. Cole on the line.

56:03.393 --> 56:06.696
Um...
Make yourself comfortable.

56:08.765 --> 56:10.500
And, Angela...

56:12.702 --> 56:15.872
You're a very strong,
brave woman.

56:18.208 --> 56:20.610
No one's ever accused me
of that before.

56:21.244 --> 56:23.012
Well, it's true.

56:23.880 --> 56:25.215
You hang tight.

56:27.217 --> 56:30.019
Hey, I am gonna get Cole
on the line...

56:31.254 --> 56:34.023
If he calls me
before I find him, just...

56:48.571 --> 56:49.973
[moans]

56:57.380 --> 57:00.650
Excuse me. Do you have
a bathroom I can use?

57:00.750 --> 57:03.286
It's in the hallway.
Past the elevators.

57:09.426 --> 57:10.827
[exhales deeply]

57:14.230 --> 57:16.299

[Terry on answering machine]
Hey, you've reached Terry Hughes.

01:01:46.502 --> 01:01:48.838
Sorry, I can't come
to the phone right now.

01:01:55.445 --> 01:01:56.713
[cell phone call ringing]

01:01:58.514 --> 01:02:00.116
[Dr. Burns on answering
machine] This is Dr. Sarah Burns.

01:02:00.216 --> 01:02:03.052
I'm away from the phone
or in a session right now.

01:03:01.677 --> 01:03:03.346
That envelope looks thin.

01:03:04.814 --> 01:03:06.916
It's a Coinbase login.

01:03:07.984 --> 01:03:09.285
Better be enough.

01:03:10.153 --> 01:03:11.754
It's everything I have left.

01:03:13.122 --> 01:03:15.792
We are contained and clean
at a corporate level.

01:03:15.858 --> 01:03:17.527
But the tech worker's
in the open.

01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:22.031
You said you had her.

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:24.467
They did.
But now they don't.

01:03:24.534 --> 01:03:26.002
What the fuck, Rivas?

01:03:26.102 --> 01:03:27.503
I can handle it.

01:03:28.437 --> 01:03:30.306
I'll use Yuri.

01:03:30.373 --> 01:03:32.441
But Yuri's expensive. So...

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:36.646
This is...
This is happening too fast.

01:03:36.712 --> 01:03:38.147
I know, right?

01:03:38.214 --> 01:03:40.683
Crazy times.
The world these days.

01:03:40.783 --> 01:03:43.820
I mean, it bums me out,
to be honest.

01:03:47.623 --> 01:03:50.560
Relax. In a week
you'll be rich.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.028
Don't ever contact me again.

01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:06.242
[Yuri] Forget how to use
a rerouter?

01:04:06.342 --> 01:04:09.645
[Rivas on phone] I need a
moving packet location in real-time.

01:04:09.712 --> 01:04:12.582
- [Yuri] Just use Spyic.
- Didn't work.

01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:15.852
- This an amateur?
- She works in tech.

01:04:15.918 --> 01:04:17.086
So she has TrakBlok.

01:04:17.186 --> 01:04:18.888
Why do you think
I called you?

01:04:19.922 --> 01:04:21.591
I like her.

01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:23.759
$50,000 if I'm always live.

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:25.394
That's usurious.

01:04:25.494 --> 01:04:27.697
No, it is not.
I'm not charging interest.

01:04:27.763 --> 01:04:29.732
It's excessive,
is what you mean.

01:04:30.399 --> 01:04:31.767
Fine. Fifty.

01:04:35.204 --> 01:04:36.405

[Yuri] You still there?

01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:34.931
[Rivas] Where the fuck else
would I be, Yuri?

01:05:34.997 --> 01:05:38.901
She's moving south on Fifth,
towards Union.

01:05:40.102 --> 01:05:42.138
You better hurry.
She's walking fast.

she's gone. Fucking gone.

01:07:53.402 --> 01:07:54.770

Yuri? You still there?
Where the fuck is she, Yuri?

01:08:06.382 --> 01:08:08.551
Question is not where she is.

01:08:09.752 --> 01:08:11.821
It's where she's going.

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:14.168
I don't know. I couldn't
see. Maybe she went north.

01:08:14.192 --> 01:08:15.491
It's a fucking mob of people.

01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:17.926
Fucking assholes, man.
They've got nothing better to do.

is wrong with people?

- [woman 2] You got the bonus.
- [woman 3 laughs]

01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:08.377

can we do it?

[thug 1] What? Like, in public?

01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:36.098
[thug 2] Sure.

01:10:36.198 --> 01:10:38.238
[thug 1] She never goes
out, now they're gonna find her

- [thug 1] Why not?
- [thug 2] I just don't like it.

01:10:48.577 --> 01:10:50.412
[thug 1] You don't have to.

01:10:56.752 --> 01:10:58.153
[thug 2] What did she do?

01:10:58.254 --> 01:11:00.756
- [thug 1] Don't start.
- [thug 2] What, you never wonder?

01:11:00.823 --> 01:11:02.791
- [thug 1] Please.
- [thug 2] Yeah...

01:11:04.326 --> 01:11:05.961

you guys?

But we got her.

- Yeah. Yeah.
