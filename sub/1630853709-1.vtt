Have a nice day.

01:53.698 --> 01:55.491
[homeless man] Get off me!
You have to run!

01:55.992 --> 01:58.995
The world will end in a flash of light
and you'll be gone!

01:59.704 --> 02:02.123
You'll all be gone,
just like the others!

[all grunting]

02:37.116 --> 02:38.409
I guess I do.

02:42.580 --> 02:44.040

02:44.582 --> 02:47.209
We're all dead! Everyone's dead!

You can't just go beating the crap
out of people, soldier.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.474
We got a public disturbance.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.351
Name's Stewart, John.

-Looks like he might be a vet...

03:49.897 --> 03:51.899

03:55.319 --> 03:56.570
[female cop] Mike, come here...

03:59.031 --> 04:00.908
You're not going to believe this,

04:05.913 --> 04:09.417
Do we really want to risk getting heat
from social media or the press?

04:12.086 --> 04:13.504
Go home, Mr. Stewart.

04:14.296 --> 04:15.464
Stay out of trouble.

06:10.663 --> 06:15.543
I found you at last, John Stewart.

Who are you? How do you know me?

06:22.091 --> 06:24.301
[gasping]

06:24.385 --> 06:27.471
You must... You must...

06:27.555 --> 06:30.057

I'm gonna take you to the hospital.

[Power Ring]
<i>Green Lantern John Stewart--</i>

07:58.729 --> 08:00.105
Stop calling me that!

the VA prescribes from now on.

08:35.933 --> 08:38.769

And you are getting off my finger!

08:46.276 --> 08:47.528

08:47.611 --> 08:50.614
Is there someone who would know
what to do in this situation?

Someone I can talk to?

08:52.324 --> 08:53.242
[Power Ring] <i>Affirmative.</i>

Can you show them to me?

Stop! Stop!

What's that up ahead?

09:31.280 --> 09:34.992
I mean... Ring, what is that up ahead?

09:35.743 --> 09:38.746
[Ring] <i>It is called
the Justice League Watchtower.</i>

10:04.313 --> 10:06.190
All right guys, I have no idea

10:06.273 --> 10:08.484
what's going on
out in galactic sector 814,

10:08.567 --> 10:11.445
but it is definitely big
and the disruption is spreading.

10:11.528 --> 10:12.863
It could even reach Earth.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.702
We need all hands on deck.

10:18.786 --> 10:22.206
Superman and Wonder Woman
should be back within a week.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.625
Perhaps they will have answers for us.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.960
It's too bad Batman's pulled
one of his disappearing acts.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.713
We're stretched too thin as it is.

10:41.225 --> 10:42.184
Hey.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.211

11:51.295 --> 11:53.380
Green Arrow, wait... look.

11:56.550 --> 11:58.635
Are you a Green Lantern?

11:58.719 --> 12:01.221
That would explain
why he didn't set off any alarms.

12:02.139 --> 12:03.473
I'm not here to fight.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.601
I just want to get rid of this thing.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.563
It is a Lantern Power Ring.

12:09.646 --> 12:12.649
The Guardians didn't say anything
about sending a new Green Lantern.

12:12.733 --> 12:15.819
Well, the Guardians haven't said squat
to us in like a year.

12:16.653 --> 12:19.615
Power Ring, who was your previous owner?

12:20.991 --> 12:22.910
<i>Green Lantern Hal Jordan.</i>

12:24.536 --> 12:26.747
Hal Jordan... is dead?

12:26.830 --> 12:28.790
Who are you?
How did you get our friend's ring?

12:31.251 --> 12:33.003
My name is John Stewart

12:33.086 --> 12:35.589
and if I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

12:41.053 --> 12:43.597
Try us. We are the Justice League.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.475
We have seen a lot.

12:46.558 --> 12:47.559
Seriously.

12:48.310 --> 12:49.394
A lot.

12:51.563 --> 12:53.398
A burning space ship crashed by me.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.609
I ran over to help and found,

12:55.692 --> 12:57.611
swear to God, a little blue alien.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.947
And, he turned to dust.

13:00.030 --> 13:03.200
Then this talking ring flew on my finger

13:03.283 --> 13:04.743
and now it won't come off.

13:13.043 --> 13:15.045
Why would a Guardian come to Earth

13:15.128 --> 13:16.630
to deliver a Power Ring?

13:16.713 --> 13:18.715
He's lying, that's why. Hal's not dead.

13:18.799 --> 13:20.509
This guy is trying to trick us.

13:20.968 --> 13:22.970
Power Rings are like my Tantu Totem.

13:23.053 --> 13:26.181
They're not easily wielded
by someone unworthy.

13:26.264 --> 13:29.101
Okay did you see
how much he sucked at using it?

13:31.186 --> 13:34.481
Perhaps this is connected
to those disturbances in deep space.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.900
Maybe we should go find out
what's going on out there.

13:36.984 --> 13:38.986
We cannot leave Earth unprotected.

13:39.069 --> 13:41.238
And since the Flash
is also on a mission,

13:41.321 --> 13:45.325
I am the only one qualified
to administrate the Watchtower.

13:45.409 --> 13:48.328
I'll go. I got to get to the truth
of what happened to Hal.

13:48.412 --> 13:50.247
You should take him with you.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.665
No way. Hard pass.

13:51.748 --> 13:54.126
Hard, hard pass.
I don't trust this guy one bit.

13:54.209 --> 13:55.836
He seems totally sketchy.

13:55.919 --> 13:58.463
You do realize I can hear you, right?

13:59.506 --> 14:01.008
Look, I'll check out the crashed ship.

14:01.091 --> 14:03.343
If it still flies, I'll autopilot to Oa.

14:03.427 --> 14:04.803
I'll get right in the Guardians faces.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.513
[laughs]

14:06.638 --> 14:08.181
I'm sure they'll love that.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.435
And if something has happened to Hal,
then we'll know.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.270
But he stays here.

14:13.979 --> 14:17.607
Uh, question, can any of you
get this ring off me?

14:19.276 --> 14:22.195
I have witnessed Green Lanterns
take their rings off,

14:22.612 --> 14:25.240
so it should be possible, unless--

14:25.699 --> 14:28.076
The ring's programming was changed?

14:28.160 --> 14:29.077
Yes.

14:29.745 --> 14:31.872
But these Guardians,
they could get it off?

14:32.497 --> 14:34.541
They did create the Power Rings.

14:39.629 --> 14:41.631
Then I'm going to this "Oa" place
with you.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.800
You got a problem with that,
talk to the hand.

14:45.469 --> 14:47.387
You know, the one with the ring on it.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.068
Hey! Watch it! Slow down!

15:02.402 --> 15:03.653
[both groaning]

15:04.946 --> 15:07.824
Terrible. On, like, all fronts.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.329
This was a burning wreck when I left it.

15:13.371 --> 15:14.581
Now, it's like new.

15:16.291 --> 15:19.294
Mm, yeah, it probably has some kind of
sophisticated self-repair program,

15:19.377 --> 15:20.754
like nanites and what have you.

15:27.344 --> 15:29.096
You seem to know your way around.

15:29.179 --> 15:31.598
Actually, I've never seen it before.
But Hal once explained to me

15:31.681 --> 15:34.184
that the real measure of
any advanced technology

15:34.267 --> 15:36.103
is how intuitive it is to use.

15:37.354 --> 15:39.439
[powering up]

15:46.321 --> 15:48.031
You think you can fly this thing to Oa?

15:48.115 --> 15:50.033
I... am not sure. Probably.

15:52.869 --> 15:53.787
But...

15:54.621 --> 15:55.539
But what?

15:57.207 --> 15:58.333
We need coordinates.

16:02.754 --> 16:03.672
Talk to your Ring.

16:04.047 --> 16:05.173
What do you mean?

16:05.507 --> 16:07.300
Well, just ask it for directions to Oa.

16:07.384 --> 16:08.468
In fact, just tell it to put them

16:08.552 --> 16:10.345
into the ship's autopilot
and get us moving.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.766
Ring, did you hear all that?
Can you do it?

16:15.308 --> 16:16.852
<i>Unlocking systems.</i>

16:16.935 --> 16:18.019
<i>Integrating.</i>

16:18.395 --> 16:19.729

16:25.152 --> 16:27.404
Um, let's go?

16:42.752 --> 16:44.754
[captivating music playing]

16:47.007 --> 16:49.426
[Ring] <i>The Guardians were

16:49.509 --> 16:51.219
<i>forms of life in the universe.</i>

16:51.303 --> 16:54.014
<i>When they perceived
that less evolved life forms</i>

16:54.097 --> 16:56.516
<i>were often prone to chaos and violence,</i>

16:56.600 --> 17:00.520
<i>they decided a police force
was necessary to keep order.</i>

17:01.271 --> 17:04.023
<i>These they called Green Lanterns,</i>

17:05.108 --> 17:06.693
<i>and their members were selected</i>

17:06.776 --> 17:09.320
<i>amongst the alien races

17:10.405 --> 17:11.281
<i>willpower</i>

17:12.324 --> 17:13.532
<i>and fearlessness.</i>

17:15.327 --> 17:16.328
Huh? [sighs]

17:21.374 --> 17:23.126
Hey, look alive, rookie. We're here.

17:26.128 --> 17:30.550
So the Guardians are a prickly bunch
that don't much like humans.

17:32.135 --> 17:34.512
-Because they've met you?
-That's good, but no.

17:34.596 --> 17:36.723
Because, they think
we're too stupid to waste time on.

17:36.806 --> 17:38.475
Please, don't prove them right.

17:46.024 --> 17:48.026
[engine powering down]

17:51.029 --> 17:53.031
[footsteps approaching]

17:57.327 --> 18:00.580
Okay, so this is why
they haven't returned our calls.

18:34.364 --> 18:35.782
[eerie music playing]

18:42.372 --> 18:43.248
[Green Arrow] You okay?

18:45.208 --> 18:46.084
Yeah.

18:48.962 --> 18:51.214
Everything here
is built around that building,

18:53.800 --> 18:55.302
like it's important or something.

18:57.220 --> 18:59.055
Maybe we'll find some answers there.

19:00.807 --> 19:03.560
Good. Nice to see you're not useless.

19:16.156 --> 19:17.574
I know this one.

19:17.657 --> 19:18.575
Sinestro.

19:19.117 --> 19:21.828
He trained Hal into becoming
the greatest Green Lantern ever.

19:23.538 --> 19:24.581
What happened to him?

19:24.664 --> 19:26.416
He turned into an evil psycho.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.711
I'm guessing they left that part out
when they gave the tour.

19:30.170 --> 19:32.172
But, again, he trained Hal.

19:34.007 --> 19:36.801
Look, it's not like
I haven't heard of Hal Jordan.

19:36.885 --> 19:38.261
And yeah, he's pretty great,

19:38.345 --> 19:41.264
but so were all these other Lanterns.
Right?

19:44.934 --> 19:46.436
Holy crap!

19:51.775 --> 19:53.943
[Console voice over speaker]
<i>Hal Jordan is acknowledged to be</i>

19:54.027 --> 19:57.113
<i>the greatest Green Lantern
in the universe.</i>

19:58.782 --> 20:00.450
In the universe?

20:01.117 --> 20:02.410
[Green Arrow] Look what I found.

20:03.370 --> 20:04.704
Ammo box, huh?

20:04.788 --> 20:07.540
Correct. This is what Lanterns use
to recharge their Rings.

20:07.624 --> 20:08.625
You'll need one.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.129
I'm here to get rid
of this thing, remember?

20:14.005 --> 20:15.298
Better to be prepared.

20:15.382 --> 20:18.385
I'm going to see what else I can find.
Just stay out of trouble, hero.

20:29.187 --> 20:31.481
Well, uh... that's something.

20:44.077 --> 20:45.328
Well, all right.

20:51.042 --> 20:52.252
[screams]

20:55.672 --> 20:57.674
[intense music playing]

21:11.271 --> 21:13.189
[grunting]

21:23.575 --> 21:25.493
Can't I leave you alone for one second?

21:46.598 --> 21:47.765
[groans]

21:50.977 --> 21:53.062
[Ring] <i>Lethal force is not authorized.</i>

21:54.981 --> 21:56.858
<i>Lethal force is not authorized.</i>

<i>Lethal force is not authorized.</i>

22:02.280 --> 22:04.365
<i>Lethal force is not authorized.</i>

22:06.618 --> 22:07.827
<i>Lethal force is not--</i>

22:07.911 --> 22:08.786
You're killing her!

22:12.165 --> 22:13.458
Stop!

22:17.212 --> 22:18.338
[gasps for breath]

22:19.214 --> 22:20.798
[breathing heavily]

22:20.882 --> 22:23.009
You should have finished me.

22:24.177 --> 22:27.263
Why? We're trying to find out
what happened here.

22:29.516 --> 22:31.935
You weren't part of the Rannian attack?

22:32.018 --> 22:34.437
Rannians? No no. We just got here.

22:34.521 --> 22:36.648
I'm Green Arrow.
His name's John Stewart.

22:37.357 --> 22:38.316
Who are you?

22:39.651 --> 22:43.947
I am Shayera Hol,
warrior of Thanagar, First Order.

22:44.739 --> 22:46.908
Okay, well, let's make a deal, Shayera.

22:47.033 --> 22:49.619
No one kills anyone
for at least a minute

22:49.702 --> 22:51.955
and instead we exchange some info.

22:54.791 --> 22:56.084
[Shayera Hol] These are the last images

22:56.167 --> 22:58.545
before the Oan security net
was disabled.

22:59.379 --> 23:00.964
A Rannian ship.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.383
It must have carried
one of their kill squads

23:03.466 --> 23:05.718
instead of the diplomats
listed in the logs.

23:06.761 --> 23:07.679
Maybe.

23:09.973 --> 23:12.058
The evidence is in front of you.

23:12.141 --> 23:14.394
Look, John and I don't see
eye to eye on a lot,

23:14.477 --> 23:17.897
but he's right, we don't know
who was in that ship.

23:17.981 --> 23:19.566
And why are you here?

23:19.649 --> 23:21.734
He's just asking, not accusing.

23:22.485 --> 23:24.654
My ship was destroyed in battle.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.864
I came to seek aid from the Guardians

23:26.948 --> 23:28.992
in our war
against the honor less Rannians

23:29.075 --> 23:30.118
but was too late.

23:31.327 --> 23:32.537
[screams in frustration]

23:34.914 --> 23:36.332
They will pay.

23:38.084 --> 23:39.377
If you're seeking vengeance,

23:39.460 --> 23:41.671
shouldn't you be sure
you have the right target?

23:43.506 --> 23:45.508
You don't understand, do you?

23:46.342 --> 23:48.136
[captivating music playing]

23:51.764 --> 23:56.603
<i>After years of bloody war,
we finally achieved the tenuous peace.</i>

23:58.605 --> 23:59.772
<i>To codify it,</i>

23:59.856 --> 24:02.859
<i>Thanagar and Rann agreed
to a joint project</i>

24:02.942 --> 24:05.194
<i>led by Sardath and Banth Dar.</i>

24:06.696 --> 24:09.699
<i>Zeta-Beam technology would be harnessed
to create a bridge</i>

24:09.782 --> 24:13.202
<i>between our worlds
and boost both of our economies.</i>

24:15.330 --> 24:17.832
Banth, begin the power up sequence!

24:22.629 --> 24:24.631
[machine powering up]

24:33.139 --> 24:34.057
[engine roaring]

24:45.026 --> 24:47.487
[Shayera] <i>Initially, the project
was a great success.</i>

24:49.405 --> 24:50.823
[cheering and applause]

24:53.368 --> 24:55.328
[alarm blaring]

24:58.081 --> 24:59.999
[alarm sounding]

25:08.591 --> 25:11.678
Green Lantern to command center.
Are you doing another test?

25:40.540 --> 25:43.251
I can't stop the emitter from firing!
We're locked out!

25:45.962 --> 25:48.339
[Sardath] <i>Green Lantern,
something has gone wrong!</i>

25:48.423 --> 25:49.799
What was your first clue?

25:50.425 --> 25:53.052
[Sardath] <i>You must stop the platform
from firing!</i>

25:54.929 --> 25:56.264
I'll try plugging it!

26:02.353 --> 26:03.396
[groaning]

26:22.707 --> 26:24.000
[screaming]

26:31.758 --> 26:34.677
[Shayera] <i>The Zeta force transported
the entire planet of Thanagar</i>

26:34.761 --> 26:39.015
<i>into Rannian space,
upsetting the ecosystem of both planets.</i>

26:39.766 --> 26:43.186
Hal Jordan and millions
of Thanagarians died that day.

26:43.269 --> 26:45.688
And the war criminal Sardath escaped.

26:46.355 --> 26:48.191
How do you know it wasn't an accident?

26:48.274 --> 26:50.109
And this ship doesn't prove anything.

26:51.277 --> 26:54.113
A true warrior does not ask questions.

26:54.197 --> 26:55.865
They do not hesitate.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.200
They kill.

26:58.868 --> 27:01.287
Kinda seems to me
we should talk to the Rannians.

27:01.370 --> 27:04.290
The nearest outpost is light years away.

27:04.373 --> 27:05.458
We have a ship.

27:05.541 --> 27:08.503
If you promise not to attack us,
you can come.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.966
I shall accompany you
and I will not attack.

27:14.050 --> 27:18.554
Unless threatened, insulted, or menaced.
Then, you die.

27:23.643 --> 27:24.894
Well, she's fun.

27:37.990 --> 27:38.991
What's this now?

27:39.075 --> 27:41.244
I discovered the Ring
comes with a manual.

27:41.327 --> 27:44.080
This exercise is part
of Green Lantern Corps training.

27:44.163 --> 27:45.164
It's like a video game.

27:46.666 --> 27:49.752
The kind of trouble
we're headed into is not a game.

27:49.836 --> 27:51.921
You said you can get
that Ring off right?

27:52.004 --> 27:54.507
Yeah. Seems I can now.

27:54.590 --> 27:56.759
I thought you wanted to get rid of it?

27:56.843 --> 27:57.844
I do.

27:57.927 --> 28:00.429
But you both need me
to make the ship go to someplace

28:00.513 --> 28:01.764
where there might be shooting--

28:03.391 --> 28:05.101
Well, yeah. I mean probably.

28:05.852 --> 28:08.646
More than likely.
Almost definitely, actually.

28:09.772 --> 28:12.441
So, until we can give this Ring
back to your friend,

28:12.525 --> 28:14.694
it's better to be prepared, right?

28:16.988 --> 28:18.990
[Ring] <i>Ring at three percent power.</i>

28:21.200 --> 28:24.120
-Come on. Just when I think I--
-You have to recharge it.

28:24.787 --> 28:25.705
Where's the battery?

28:34.964 --> 28:36.132
Stick your hand in it.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.555
It's not doing anything.

28:42.638 --> 28:43.890
You gotta say the oath.

28:43.973 --> 28:45.808
Oath? What oath?

28:46.475 --> 28:48.311
Yeah. Repeat after me...

28:48.978 --> 28:51.147
"In brightest day, in blackest night,

28:51.230 --> 28:52.982
no evil shall escape my sight.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.984
Let those who worship evil's might,

28:55.067 --> 28:57.320
beware my power...
Green Lantern's light."

28:58.070 --> 28:59.405
You're kidding, right?

28:59.488 --> 29:02.158
No, I am not.
Say it out loud and proud.

29:05.328 --> 29:07.330
"In brightest day, in blackest night,

29:07.413 --> 29:09.582
no evil shall escape my sight.

29:09.665 --> 29:11.667
Let those who worship evil's might,

29:11.751 --> 29:14.086
beware my power...
Green Lantern's light."

29:14.211 --> 29:15.546
[lantern powering up]

29:28.768 --> 29:30.937
[Ring] <i>Ring at 100 percent power.</i>

29:31.020 --> 29:33.856
Of all the hokey, lame-ass things...

30:09.392 --> 30:13.062
The Rannian scum have murdered
the Thanagarians sent to destroy them.

30:13.187 --> 30:15.606
Mmm-hmm. You hear yourself, right?

30:17.608 --> 30:19.110
[thunder rumbling]

30:35.209 --> 30:36.127
Move!

30:51.308 --> 30:53.269
[dramatic music playing]

31:03.112 --> 31:04.155
[grumbles]

31:06.615 --> 31:09.493
Okay, everyone take a moment
and remember our manners.

31:09.744 --> 31:12.288
[screaming]

31:13.164 --> 31:14.165
Aw, crap.

31:27.261 --> 31:28.345
[groans]

31:41.484 --> 31:43.235
Does everyone here
want to kill each other?

31:52.369 --> 31:53.370
[groans]

32:03.422 --> 32:05.299
[screaming]

32:06.175 --> 32:08.803
Think! We need to question him.

32:12.181 --> 32:15.518
Of course, interrogation first.

32:16.477 --> 32:18.020
Then, execution.

32:30.658 --> 32:34.120
I don't fear death. Get on with it.

32:35.371 --> 32:39.291
We had nothing to do with this.
And we don't want to kill you.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.878
Just answer our questions, please.

32:44.046 --> 32:46.048
This is pointless.

32:46.132 --> 32:48.342
What can he tell us
that is of any value?

32:48.425 --> 32:50.427
Maybe give him a second to answer?

32:50.511 --> 32:53.013
What was that bright light
that brought you here?

32:54.974 --> 32:57.393
He's a Green Lantern.
Aren't they allies of yours?

33:00.479 --> 33:03.816
They were until his people
Killed the Guardians.

33:05.943 --> 33:08.070
The Guardians are dead? How?

33:08.737 --> 33:09.905
First thing's first.

33:09.989 --> 33:10.990
The bright light.

33:12.992 --> 33:14.326
It was a Zeta-Beam.

33:14.994 --> 33:17.913
They seem attracted to me.
I don't know why.

33:17.997 --> 33:19.790
But when they hit, they transport me

33:19.874 --> 33:22.251
to different, far-reaching parts
of the galaxy.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.253
I have little control over them.

33:25.838 --> 33:28.174
Fairy tales and lies can't undo the fact

33:28.257 --> 33:32.553
that Rann destroyed Oa
and murdered the Green Lanterns.

33:33.345 --> 33:36.348
No. Rann is allied with the Guardians.

33:36.432 --> 33:39.018
The Green Lanterns
are heroes to the Rannians.

33:39.101 --> 33:41.520
If I can get to High Command,
I'll show you.

33:43.272 --> 33:45.482
[scoffs] The only thing this man
could show us

33:45.566 --> 33:47.693
is the fastest way
to the bottom of a bottle.

33:48.986 --> 33:50.696
I know how I look.

33:50.779 --> 33:52.698
But I'm Adam Strange.

33:53.991 --> 33:56.452
You? You're the Night Flyer?

33:56.535 --> 33:59.788
The Bane of the Wingmen? Not likely.

33:59.872 --> 34:03.125
Adam Strange is dead, gone years ago.

34:03.792 --> 34:06.545
Gone, yes. Dead, no.

34:06.629 --> 34:10.132
A Zeta-Beam took me and I couldn't
figure out how to get back.

34:10.216 --> 34:11.800
[Green Arrow] So, how are you here now?

34:12.384 --> 34:15.721
Random chance.
Zeta-Beams are unpredictable.

34:16.722 --> 34:18.974
As are Rannian cutthroats.

34:20.391 --> 34:21.560
Listen to me.

34:21.643 --> 34:24.063
Rannians would never attack Oa.

34:25.313 --> 34:26.315
Okay, then.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.734
Let's go to your High Command
and see if you're right.

34:31.737 --> 34:34.531
Our answers will be found on Rann.

34:34.614 --> 34:36.909
And so will my vengeance.

34:37.659 --> 34:40.621
Great road trip crew
you've assembled, John.

34:40.704 --> 34:41.956
Try not to get murdered.

35:00.599 --> 35:01.767
[Ring] <i>Test complete.</i>

35:04.353 --> 35:06.855
<i>For a Bering that does not want
to be a Green Lantern,</i>

35:06.939 --> 35:08.607
<i>you show some ability.</i>

35:08.691 --> 35:10.526
Just passing the time.

35:11.485 --> 35:12.820
[thudding]

35:23.622 --> 35:24.957
[distant explosion]

35:52.651 --> 35:55.738
What was it that caused the war
between Thanagar and Rann?

35:55.821 --> 35:57.573
Rannian treachery, of course.

35:57.656 --> 36:01.827
Under a guise of a peaceful experiment
meant to benefit everyone,

36:01.910 --> 36:05.497
they transported their planet
into our system to conquer it.

36:05.581 --> 36:07.750
What do you mean Thanagar transported?

36:07.833 --> 36:11.378
You attacked our capital city first
and destroyed it!

36:11.462 --> 36:15.174
That was the war you were
involved in years ago. Many died.

36:15.257 --> 36:18.093
Since you've been gone,
it finally ended in peace.

36:18.177 --> 36:22.639
And as a gesture of hope and goodwill,
we became allies.

36:22.723 --> 36:24.683
Until your leaders tricked us

36:24.767 --> 36:27.269
and tried to destroy Thanagar for good!

36:35.361 --> 36:37.946
So, we should leave
before either side sees us.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.031
Not yet.

36:44.953 --> 36:46.372
It's just a derelict being yanked

36:46.538 --> 36:48.457
into the gravitational pull
of a red dwarf.

36:49.208 --> 36:51.460
[Shayera] It appears our fighters
did their jobs well.

36:51.543 --> 36:52.544
Can you give it a rest?

36:52.628 --> 36:54.588
I may be able to access
the main computer

36:54.671 --> 36:56.048
with a scan of my DNA.

37:11.355 --> 37:13.732
Oh, yeah, they-- they love you.

37:17.486 --> 37:20.656
[voice over speaker] <i>It seems
the deities have granted me my wish.</i>

37:22.658 --> 37:25.577
To have the pleasure
of killing one more Thanagarian.

37:27.037 --> 37:30.374
Wait! You are Kantus of House Thrax.

37:30.457 --> 37:32.084
<i>A great and noble captain.</i>

37:32.835 --> 37:36.255
Am I so well known to Thanagarian spies?

37:37.923 --> 37:40.008
It's me, Adam Strange.

37:41.593 --> 37:42.803
He's dead.

37:43.303 --> 37:45.347
Scan me and see the truth.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.778
We thought you died years ago.

38:00.612 --> 38:03.157
I've been away. Now I'm back.

38:03.949 --> 38:07.202
Then, the Thanagarian is your prisoner?

38:07.286 --> 38:09.538
Prisoner? You Rannian--

38:09.621 --> 38:13.125
She's helping solve a mystery
that affects both Rann and Thanagar.

38:13.208 --> 38:17.171
But we need your help.
Can we tap into your ship's computers?

38:21.800 --> 38:24.303
<i>I've disengaged the firewalls.</i>

38:35.063 --> 38:37.816
I'd especially like to know
why Rann attacked Oa.

38:39.151 --> 38:42.237
What? Rann didn't attack Oa!

38:42.321 --> 38:45.282
You lie! We have evidence!

38:45.365 --> 38:48.160
<i>It's too late for all your accusations.</i>

38:49.244 --> 38:53.499
<i>Soon all your kind
will be wiped out of existence.</i>

38:55.292 --> 38:56.877
What are you talking about?

38:56.960 --> 39:02.549
<i>Our greatest scientist is building
a weapon that will destroy Thanagar</i>

39:02.633 --> 39:05.511
<i>and end this war once and for all.</i>

39:05.594 --> 39:08.013
Sardath. Where?

39:09.932 --> 39:12.017
Only a few key people know.

39:13.227 --> 39:15.103
I'm not one of them.

39:15.229 --> 39:16.188
[explosion]

39:18.232 --> 39:20.192
This ship is doomed.

39:21.443 --> 39:25.948
As captain, I intend to die with her.

39:26.031 --> 39:29.785
Ring, can you do anything to get
the battle cruiser moving again?

39:29.868 --> 39:32.871
[Ring] <i>Rerouting power
to the kevval engines is possible.</i>

39:32.955 --> 39:36.500
<i>It may be enough to defeat
the gravitational pull of the red dwarf.</i>

39:36.583 --> 39:39.461
<i>Provided the hull
survives the forces required.</i>

39:39.962 --> 39:41.463
Re-route all power.

39:42.130 --> 39:43.549
Whatever you have to do.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.051
Do it!

40:18.750 --> 40:22.921
<i>Rannian battle cruiser has escaped
the red dwarf's gravitational pull.</i>

40:23.005 --> 40:24.923
Now he can limp his way home.

40:25.007 --> 40:26.341
[Kantus] <i>I don't believe so.</i>

40:27.426 --> 40:29.303
<i>Thank you Adam Strange.</i>

40:30.929 --> 40:32.764
<i>Onward for Rann!</i>

40:45.944 --> 40:47.529
He's going back to the battle!

40:48.363 --> 40:49.364
Idiot.

40:49.448 --> 40:52.534
His ship is useless.
What can he hope to do?

41:12.846 --> 41:16.391
A noble death in battle.
For everyone involved.

41:18.602 --> 41:19.936
Let's get out of here.

41:35.035 --> 41:37.496
Come over here. We've made progress.

41:37.579 --> 41:41.416
Are you two actually in a room together
without tearing at each other's throats?

41:42.918 --> 41:45.170
Wow. Okay. Yes. Okay. All right.

41:45.921 --> 41:47.464
What have you found out?

41:47.547 --> 41:51.343
When the Zeta-Beam transported
Thanagar into Rann's atmosphere,

41:51.426 --> 41:53.720
it caused
catastrophic climate disasters.

42:04.815 --> 42:06.274
<i>The planet survived.</i>

42:06.358 --> 42:08.360
<i>And that's what started the war.</i>

42:09.194 --> 42:10.362
[screams]

42:11.363 --> 42:13.907
Now Sardath has re-engineered
the Zeta-Beam

42:13.990 --> 42:16.118
into a weapon of total destruction.

42:17.744 --> 42:19.287
A planet destroyer.

42:21.123 --> 42:22.374
We've got to stop him.

42:22.457 --> 42:23.875
Any idea where they're based?

42:25.127 --> 42:26.545
Unfortunately, no.

42:26.628 --> 42:28.130
But we do have a lead.

42:28.213 --> 42:31.216
We were examining the data
on the attack on Oa.

42:31.299 --> 42:32.718
We discovered this.

42:44.521 --> 42:46.148
[Green Arrow] It's a Rannian ship.

42:46.231 --> 42:47.649
You were right.

42:47.733 --> 42:48.984
So I thought.

42:49.067 --> 42:52.863
But when we examined
the drive signature it left behind,

42:52.946 --> 42:54.740
something unusual turned up.

42:54.823 --> 42:57.617
We found an exact match.

42:59.828 --> 43:02.038
It was identical
to a ship that bombarded

43:02.122 --> 43:05.041
the United Galactic
Council Headquarters years ago,

43:05.125 --> 43:08.837
sabotaging the first peace talks
and killing several hundred people.

43:09.755 --> 43:12.090
But that was a Thanagarian ship.

43:12.174 --> 43:14.551
And that same ship's signature
was also found

43:14.634 --> 43:17.262
at the scene of many more
unwarranted attacks.

43:18.513 --> 43:21.933
Somebody is impersonating both
Rannians and Thanagarians

43:22.017 --> 43:23.560
to cause your war.

43:23.643 --> 43:25.270
It would seem so.

43:26.271 --> 43:29.316
Strange and I calculated the direction
the drive signatures left

43:29.399 --> 43:30.776
after many such attacks.

43:30.859 --> 43:34.029
In each case, the ship headed
in this direction.

43:35.405 --> 43:37.449
And if we triangulate the escape routes,

43:37.532 --> 43:41.119
they all meet here, in this sector.

43:41.870 --> 43:44.790
If we want answers,
this is where we find them.

43:58.428 --> 44:00.388
Maybe your calculations were wrong?

44:00.472 --> 44:01.681
There's nothing here.

44:14.319 --> 44:15.779
Spoke too soon!

44:42.264 --> 44:43.682
I'm on the weapons!

44:51.022 --> 44:52.274
Nice shooting.

44:52.357 --> 44:55.861
Those guns are here to protect
something or somebody.

44:58.864 --> 45:00.448
Bingo. A shielded structure.

45:01.116 --> 45:02.367
I can't see what's inside.

45:03.285 --> 45:05.412
There's only one way to find out.

45:31.146 --> 45:33.148
[Shayera] Artificial gravity and oxygen.

45:33.732 --> 45:35.817
Somebody went to a lot of trouble

45:35.901 --> 45:38.320
to build a hideout in this asteroid.

45:38.403 --> 45:42.574
Well, since they made it so hospitable,
let's go pay them a visit.

45:56.630 --> 45:57.589
[groans]

46:09.267 --> 46:10.393
[groaning]

46:30.705 --> 46:33.959
What was that you were saying
about this place being hospitable?

46:38.213 --> 46:39.506
[dramatic music playing]

47:14.582 --> 47:16.376
[whooshes]

47:46.322 --> 47:48.241
[struggling]

47:58.918 --> 47:59.961
[groans]

48:11.181 --> 48:12.682
Do it! Kill him!

48:17.645 --> 48:18.480
No.

48:20.315 --> 48:21.733
I've had enough killing.

48:22.442 --> 48:23.651
[Sinestro laughs]

48:24.402 --> 48:27.238
How odd. When it comes to killing,

48:27.322 --> 48:28.990
I can't get enough of it!

48:30.075 --> 48:31.117
Drop your weapons

48:31.201 --> 48:33.828
or this Green Lantern
becomes green slime.

48:40.668 --> 48:42.253
While we're on the subject.

48:46.091 --> 48:47.842
I think I'll relieve you of this.

48:52.013 --> 48:53.807
With your lack of experience,

48:53.890 --> 48:56.851
you give new meaning
to the name "Green" Lantern.

48:58.353 --> 48:59.354
Lights out.

49:34.681 --> 49:35.890
[groans]

49:36.391 --> 49:37.350
John!

49:37.433 --> 49:39.894
[Sinestro] I wouldn't try that again.

49:40.645 --> 49:43.481
Next time, you'll be reduced
to a pile of ash.

49:44.482 --> 49:45.942
You look familiar.

49:46.025 --> 49:47.569
His name is Sinestro.

49:47.652 --> 49:50.238
He's a Green Lantern who went rogue.

49:51.990 --> 49:55.994
If by "went rogue" you mean
I saw through the Guardian's lies,

49:56.077 --> 50:01.583
then yes, I've embraced the power
of yellow energy and gone rogue.

50:02.333 --> 50:05.253
The color yellow is the one thing
your ring power is useless against.

50:05.336 --> 50:07.338
Yeah, the ring told me.

50:07.422 --> 50:11.176
But I've been up against
that kind of barrier my whole life.

50:12.177 --> 50:14.262
It hasn't stopped me yet.

50:14.345 --> 50:16.389
Why don't you just kill us?

50:17.682 --> 50:19.934
Because I may have a use for you.

50:20.935 --> 50:24.772
But don't worry,
your death is a viable option.

50:26.691 --> 50:27.942
We could dig our way out.

50:28.026 --> 50:29.611
[man] Good thing I've got a head start.

50:34.949 --> 50:35.950
Hal!

50:37.285 --> 50:39.454
I knew you were alive!
You're too stubborn to die!

50:39.537 --> 50:41.789
You're a sight for sore eyes, Ollie.

50:41.873 --> 50:42.957
What are you doing here?

50:43.041 --> 50:45.710
We came looking for you
after your ring turned up on his finger.

50:45.793 --> 50:47.503
His name's John Stewart.

50:50.715 --> 50:53.927
And this is Shayera and Adam Strange.

50:54.385 --> 50:55.887
The Rannian hero?

50:55.970 --> 50:58.389
I wish we were meeting
under better circumstances.

50:58.848 --> 51:00.058
So do I.

51:00.683 --> 51:03.519
Apparently, your ring
was given to John by a Guardian.

51:04.062 --> 51:06.231
So... you received my ring.

51:07.023 --> 51:07.941
From what I heard,

51:08.024 --> 51:11.486
they screwed up big-time
by choosing me as your replacement.

51:12.153 --> 51:14.072
Oh, the Guardians don't make mistakes

51:14.155 --> 51:15.823
when it comes
to appointing a Green Lantern.

51:16.908 --> 51:18.576
They've been doing it
for a million years.

51:19.244 --> 51:20.995
They won't be doing it anymore.

51:22.247 --> 51:23.665
Oa has been destroyed.

51:24.582 --> 51:26.251
The Guardians are dead.

51:31.756 --> 51:32.799
Sinestro.

51:34.259 --> 51:38.596
We think he disguised his ship
as a Rannian vessel and attacked them.

51:39.430 --> 51:40.598
He's done even worse.

51:41.391 --> 51:43.685
He sabotaged Sardath's grand experiment.

51:45.186 --> 51:46.688
So he started the war?

51:48.147 --> 51:49.524
Why would he do that?

51:50.358 --> 51:51.609
Because he's insane!

51:52.777 --> 51:55.196
Sinestro thrives on chaos and death.

51:55.280 --> 51:57.949
Sure, I get that.
But how did you end up here?

51:59.200 --> 52:01.536
And how did your ring end up with me?

52:02.203 --> 52:05.123
I was told rings only leave Lanterns
after they die.

52:06.708 --> 52:07.875
Good questions.

52:07.959 --> 52:11.129
I'll give you the quick
and dirty explanation...

52:12.130 --> 52:14.632
<i>I was asked to keep watch
on Sardath's experiment.</i>

52:14.716 --> 52:17.010
<i>And while I was outside
with the science barge...</i>

52:17.802 --> 52:20.722
<i>Sinestro infiltrated the base.</i>

52:24.934 --> 52:26.978
<i>The experiment went out of control.</i>

52:29.814 --> 52:32.817
<i>I was pulled onto the planet
before it teleported with everyone else.</i>

52:45.163 --> 52:46.414
<i>Before I passed out,</i>

52:46.497 --> 52:49.083
<i>I released my ring
so Sinestro couldn't get it.</i>

52:58.843 --> 52:59.844
<i>When I came to...</i>

53:00.928 --> 53:04.182
I was here.
And I've been here ever since.

53:05.350 --> 53:06.851
As for my ring...

53:06.934 --> 53:09.479
Well, It must have been found
by the Guardians and they,

53:09.562 --> 53:10.813
in their wisdom,

53:10.897 --> 53:13.107
chose to reassign it
to a worthy candidate.

53:14.275 --> 53:16.277
I'll be happy to give it back to you.

53:16.361 --> 53:18.529
If I ever get it back, that is.

53:20.531 --> 53:21.783
We've gotta escape.

53:22.825 --> 53:25.119
Right. To stop Sinestro.

53:25.203 --> 53:27.789
Odd as this is,
Sinestro is problem number two.

53:27.872 --> 53:29.707
First we've got to get to Rann

53:29.791 --> 53:33.044
and stop Sardath from using his new
Doomsday Weapon to destroy Thanagar.

53:34.212 --> 53:35.421
Doomsday Weapon?

53:36.214 --> 53:39.300
Sardath is going to use Zeta-Beams
as a mega-weapon.

53:39.384 --> 53:41.719
He's trying it out in a secret location.

53:41.803 --> 53:43.888
Only the Rannian High Command
knows where.

53:45.056 --> 53:46.057
Really...

53:49.644 --> 53:52.146
Thank you for all that information.

53:52.230 --> 53:54.816
See? You were useful after all.

53:55.733 --> 53:57.819
You should be proud. [chuckles]

53:58.319 --> 53:59.987
You'll never get your hands on it.

54:00.071 --> 54:02.907
No matter how much of an assault
you launch on Rann.

54:02.990 --> 54:04.492
Their defenses are too good.

54:04.575 --> 54:05.868
An assault on Rann

54:05.952 --> 54:08.162
to find the location
of their Doomsday Weapon?

54:09.997 --> 54:11.582
What a splendid idea!

54:11.666 --> 54:13.501
I'll get on that right away!

54:19.006 --> 54:21.509
We really suck
at being covert operators.

54:21.592 --> 54:24.512
Jordan, you said you were
on the verge of escaping.

54:24.595 --> 54:25.596
How?

54:27.014 --> 54:28.182
I've been digging.

54:28.266 --> 54:30.351
Judging from the warmer temperature
of the rock,

54:30.435 --> 54:32.478
I think the controls
for the force field door

54:32.562 --> 54:34.856
are powered by conduits
running through here.

54:34.939 --> 54:36.441
If I can just get to them...

54:36.524 --> 54:39.777
We turn off the force field
by short-circuiting its power feed!

54:40.361 --> 54:41.362
I'm almost there.

54:41.446 --> 54:43.531
But it's another foot of rock
to grind through.

54:45.700 --> 54:47.452
Would an Nth metal knife help?

54:50.163 --> 54:52.290
The hardest substance in the universe?

54:52.373 --> 54:54.542
Yeah, might come in handy.

55:13.019 --> 55:14.770
[captivating music playing]

55:21.152 --> 55:23.821
Lord Damyn, Lyssa,
ready the ship at once.

55:24.572 --> 55:26.574
Dress it as a Thanagarian cruiser.

55:27.533 --> 55:29.827
They're working on it as we speak.

55:30.745 --> 55:34.332
Excellent. Rann will never expect
an attack.

55:35.458 --> 55:38.503
The element of surprise
should yield a fruitful result.

56:11.619 --> 56:13.204
He has my mace.

56:13.287 --> 56:15.456
How rude. Allow me.

56:27.969 --> 56:28.970
[groans]

56:42.817 --> 56:43.818
He's dead.

56:44.735 --> 56:45.820
Serves him right.

56:46.737 --> 56:48.906
I've never known you
to be indifferent to death.

56:50.241 --> 56:53.578
Yeah well, months of being brutalized
in captivity will do that to a man.

56:56.998 --> 56:58.833
And millions of lives are at stake.

57:00.126 --> 57:02.295
Let's get out of here
before the others leave that ship.

57:09.343 --> 57:10.428
[Green Arrow] I'll fire up the engines.

57:10.511 --> 57:11.345
Wait.

57:11.429 --> 57:13.931
We need to get the ring.
The Green Lantern ring.

57:14.473 --> 57:15.474
What? Come on. All you've done

57:15.558 --> 57:17.310
is complain about it
and now you want it?

57:17.893 --> 57:20.521
Between Hal and me,
one of us should have it.

57:20.605 --> 57:23.357
We're going into battle.
We might need it.

57:24.442 --> 57:25.943
We don't have time
to go back and get it.

57:26.027 --> 57:27.028
Not necessary.

57:27.111 --> 57:29.697
All John has to do is will it to come.

57:29.780 --> 57:31.616
It doesn't matter where the ring is.

57:32.867 --> 57:34.702
It'll find a way to get to him.

57:34.785 --> 57:37.288
Close your eyes and will it back.

57:37.371 --> 57:38.831
But it's your ring.

57:38.914 --> 57:40.207
Not anymore.

57:40.291 --> 57:41.709
It answers to you now.

57:42.418 --> 57:44.295
Close your eyes. Summon it!

57:44.378 --> 57:47.381
Yeah, and Sinestro probably
put it with all of our other weapons.

57:47.465 --> 57:49.467
See if you can grab those up, too!

58:08.110 --> 58:10.029
[music increases in tempo]

58:19.121 --> 58:20.790
[dramatic music playing]

58:33.761 --> 58:35.846
What? No! The ring!

58:36.430 --> 58:37.515
Get it! Get it!

58:54.240 --> 58:55.157
What?

58:56.367 --> 58:59.120
Ring, do we have enough fuel
to make a jump to warp speed?

59:00.371 --> 59:01.455
<i>Inconclusive.</i>

59:02.289 --> 59:04.709
That's wonderful. Strap in, everybody.

59:12.550 --> 59:15.177
This ship needs
several months in space dock.

59:15.261 --> 59:18.639
Hull integrity diminishing.
Breach in five seconds.

59:18.723 --> 59:20.683
I'm dropping us out of warp speed.

59:24.061 --> 59:25.813
We still have a long way to go.

59:25.896 --> 59:28.232
Well, I'll drive as fast as I can
without the hyperdrive.

59:39.410 --> 59:42.663
Sinestro beat us to Rann!
What do we do now?

59:46.167 --> 59:49.170
<i>Adam Strange calling
Rannian High Command.</i>

59:49.253 --> 59:50.755
Is this some kind of trick?

59:50.838 --> 59:52.339
Commander Strange is no longer--

59:52.423 --> 59:55.426
[Adam] <i>Jorson? Is that you? It's Adam.</i>

59:55.509 --> 59:57.762
<i>Are you still terrible at Jaccarat?</i>

01:00:02.933 --> 01:00:05.269
By her Lady's Grace, it is you!

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:08.522
Open a window in the shield
for us to get through.

01:00:08.606 --> 01:00:10.483
I'll explain everything when I see you.

01:00:10.566 --> 01:00:12.193
[Jorson] <i>Sending you coordinates now.</i>

01:00:12.276 --> 01:00:14.278
<i>The window will open for two seconds.</i>

01:00:15.112 --> 01:00:16.405
That's all we need.

01:00:29.502 --> 01:00:30.878
Annihilate them.

01:00:40.554 --> 01:00:41.972
[alarm beeping]

01:00:42.223 --> 01:00:43.808
We've got company.

01:01:07.581 --> 01:01:10.376
Hmm. As I live and breathe.

01:01:10.459 --> 01:01:12.753
I never thought
I'd lay eyes on you again.

01:01:12.837 --> 01:01:14.171
It's good to be back.

01:01:15.631 --> 01:01:19.093
I'm sorry the circumstances
of your homecoming are so grim.

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:22.847
I have no idea why these Thanagarians
have launched this futile attack.

01:01:22.930 --> 01:01:24.348
They're not Thanagarians.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.353
What nonsense is your prisoner speaking?

01:01:29.436 --> 01:01:31.605
I am not a prisoner!

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:34.191
She's not and she's right.

01:01:34.275 --> 01:01:36.777
We've uncovered a plot
by a band of rogue agents

01:01:36.861 --> 01:01:39.697
to start and keep this war going
between our worlds.

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:41.866
They're the ones firing on you now!

01:01:41.949 --> 01:01:45.202
That ship is not Thanagarian.
It's disguised.

01:01:45.286 --> 01:01:46.871
We never thought to check.

01:01:46.954 --> 01:01:48.998
But if what you say is true...

01:01:49.081 --> 01:01:51.125
We know about the secret weapon.

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:54.378
We have to stop Sardath
from using it on Thanagar.

01:01:54.461 --> 01:01:56.630
And I need your help to contact him.

01:01:58.716 --> 01:02:01.385
Adam? Is it really you!?

01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:04.388
<i>Yes. I have to see you at once.</i>

01:02:04.471 --> 01:02:06.140
<i>Don't deploy your weapon.</i>

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:07.308
How do you know about--

01:02:07.391 --> 01:02:09.059
<i>Billions of innocent lives are art stake.</i>

01:02:09.143 --> 01:02:10.895
<i>It can't be used!</i>

01:02:11.562 --> 01:02:13.105
But my weapon is the only thing

01:02:13.188 --> 01:02:16.483
that will stop the Thanagarians
from killing more of us.

01:02:16.567 --> 01:02:19.570
And I have you
to thank for its creation.

01:02:20.154 --> 01:02:21.071
<i>Me?</i>

01:02:21.155 --> 01:02:23.908
It was the analysis
of your unique biology

01:02:23.991 --> 01:02:26.827
that made it possible
to isolate your metagene.

01:02:26.911 --> 01:02:27.912
<i>Metagene?</i>

01:02:28.579 --> 01:02:31.749
I knew Zeta energy always found you,

01:02:31.832 --> 01:02:33.500
as though drawn to you.

01:02:33.584 --> 01:02:37.171
I noticed that you were born
with a unique metagene

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:39.423
and that was my first breakthrough.

01:02:40.758 --> 01:02:44.428
<i>I gained some control over
where the Zeta-Beams went.</i>

01:02:48.098 --> 01:02:52.144
<i>Eventually, I was able
to amplify the phenomenon.</i>

01:02:58.609 --> 01:03:03.280
<i>Now, I command vast amounts
of Zeta energy at will!</i>

01:03:04.114 --> 01:03:06.075
[Zeta-Beam charging up]

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.953
<i>We've begun building
a charge large enough</i>

01:03:09.036 --> 01:03:11.705
<i>to teleport Thanagar into a supernova!</i>

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:16.210
Rann will be forever safe!

01:03:17.044 --> 01:03:18.796
<i>I beg you not to use it.</i>

01:03:18.879 --> 01:03:20.714
<i>You'll be murdering innocents.</i>

01:03:20.798 --> 01:03:23.801
I'm shocked to hear such cowardice
from you,

01:03:23.884 --> 01:03:26.595
especially since Thanagar
was responsible

01:03:26.679 --> 01:03:30.307
for the death of your wife,
my beloved daughter, Alanna.

01:03:31.308 --> 01:03:32.726
<i>If Alanna were alive,</i>

01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:34.061
<i>she'd be ashamed to learn</i>

01:03:34.144 --> 01:03:36.814
<i>that instead of trying
to find our daughter Aleea,</i>

01:03:36.897 --> 01:03:40.401
<i>you've been using your time
figuring out how to kill billions!</i>

01:03:40.484 --> 01:03:41.568
How dare you!?

01:03:42.361 --> 01:03:45.489
<i>Thanagar nor Rann started
this war and I can prove it.</i>

01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:49.076
<i>But I'll have to see you face-to-face
to show you the evidence.</i>

01:03:49.159 --> 01:03:50.828
I can't do that.

01:03:50.911 --> 01:03:54.331
My location is a secret
of the greatest importance,

01:03:54.415 --> 01:03:58.752
too sensitive to transmit,
even over a secure line.

01:03:58.836 --> 01:04:02.506
But I can use a Zeta-Beam
to transport you here.

01:04:05.509 --> 01:04:07.678
<i>Fine. There are five of us.</i>

01:04:18.564 --> 01:04:21.108
[engine powering up]

01:04:28.032 --> 01:04:30.534
Don't like that transporter stuff
one bit.

01:04:33.454 --> 01:04:35.664
Sardath, in memory of Alanna,

01:04:35.748 --> 01:04:39.209
I'm here to prevent you
from making a terrible mistake.

01:04:39.293 --> 01:04:41.837
Your first Zeta experiment
was sabotaged.

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:43.547
It caused this war!

01:04:46.133 --> 01:04:47.634
What are you talking about?

01:04:47.718 --> 01:04:49.261
[alarm blaring]

01:04:53.182 --> 01:04:55.726
<i>We're being approached
by a Thanagarian attack ship!</i>

01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:03.901
Sinestro! How did he follow us here?

01:05:03.984 --> 01:05:05.736
Doesn't matter. Get ready for a fight.

01:06:24.356 --> 01:06:25.899

[Green Arrow] Hal!?

01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:27.794
No time to be soft, pal.

01:07:55.155 --> 01:07:56.198
[John groans]

01:08:09.419 --> 01:08:11.838
Now I'll have the sheer delight

01:08:11.922 --> 01:08:15.092
of destroying the last
of the Green Lanterns.

01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:38.198
[dramatic music playing]

01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:47.457
[coughs]

01:08:58.385 --> 01:08:59.636
Damn you.

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:02.471
You gave me no choice.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:08.729
My master will kill you all!

01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:11.439

01:10:58.922 --> 01:10:59.840
Come on!

01:10:59.923 --> 01:11:02.259
We've got to get to Sardath
before he uses the Weapon.

01:11:10.642 --> 01:11:13.437
Good news. Sardath isn't going
to use the weapon.

01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:15.856
He's handing over the CPU

01:11:15.939 --> 01:11:18.942
containing the core
of his Zeta technology to me.

01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:21.778
The code is downloading
to this storage unit.

01:11:23.029 --> 01:11:27.534
The only other place where
this knowledge is stored is my mind.

01:11:28.285 --> 01:11:29.536
Excellent.

01:11:32.456 --> 01:11:34.958
Hal! What have you done?

01:11:38.378 --> 01:11:39.963
What was necessary!

01:11:41.381 --> 01:11:44.134
But there's still
a lot of work to be done.

01:11:44.217 --> 01:11:45.427
[gunshot]

01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:02.569
Oh, you'll have to do better than that.

01:12:04.571 --> 01:12:06.406
Hal, what's wrong with you?

01:12:07.407 --> 01:12:10.410
We had it all backwards.
He wasn't Sinestro's prisoner.

01:12:10.494 --> 01:12:12.412
Hal was his master!

01:12:13.622 --> 01:12:16.333
Right you are, John. Right you are.

01:12:16.416 --> 01:12:19.002
I have him to thank
for my transformation.

01:12:20.754 --> 01:12:25.091
He was the stepping stone
so I could fulfill my true calling...

01:12:30.138 --> 01:12:31.515
with these!

01:12:53.411 --> 01:12:55.539
<i>After the experiment went haywire,</i>

01:12:55.622 --> 01:12:58.416
<i>Sinestro infected me
with an alien parasite.</i>

01:13:00.293 --> 01:13:02.796
<i>He called it the Parallax entity!</i>

[choking]

01:13:08.885 --> 01:13:10.679

[groaning]

01:13:20.564 --> 01:13:23.608
<i>But instead, it opened my eyes.</i>

01:13:27.821 --> 01:13:30.073
<i>It filled me with new purpose.</i>

01:13:30.156 --> 01:13:31.825
<i>For too long, I had been blind</i>

01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:35.495
<i>to the corrosive effect
of war and conflict.</i>

01:13:44.713 --> 01:13:46.965
[explosion]

<i>I could be a better Guardian
than the Guardians.</i>

01:14:10.030 --> 01:14:11.698
<i>There was no use for them anymore.</i>

01:14:20.957 --> 01:14:23.752
<i>After Sinestro saw my truth and genius,</i>

01:14:23.835 --> 01:14:26.129
<i>he became my main acolyte.</i>

01:14:34.304 --> 01:14:36.306
[screaming]

01:14:43.313 --> 01:14:47.233
With this weapon,
I can fulfill my true purpose.

01:14:47.317 --> 01:14:51.821
I can wipe the universe clean
and create a newer, better one--

01:14:51.905 --> 01:14:53.573
Like a God!

01:15:07.337 --> 01:15:08.421

I've set the Zeta-Beam to destroy
both Rann and Thanagar.

01:16:23.997 --> 01:16:29.002
Make the choice and join me
in making a new and better galaxy.

01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:33.840
My only choice is to stop you
or die trying.

01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:59.282
Hal! This isn't you!

01:17:01.868 --> 01:17:03.036
You're right.

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:06.080
The old me would continue
a useless fight against evil

01:17:06.164 --> 01:17:07.373
as a Green Lantern.

01:17:10.543 --> 01:17:13.171
But the new me is a god.

01:17:17.383 --> 01:17:19.302
And I thought you were my friend.

01:17:20.386 --> 01:17:21.971
I am your friend, Hal.

01:17:22.055 --> 01:17:24.557
Just listen to me and stop this madness!

01:17:33.191 --> 01:17:34.692
Try to stop the Zeta-Beam!

01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:41.908
Why fight me?

01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:45.495
Aren't I doing exactly what you'd do
if you were in my place?

01:17:45.578 --> 01:17:47.914
I can see it in your eyes.

01:17:47.997 --> 01:17:51.167
You hate what the universe
has become as much as I do.

01:17:52.919 --> 01:17:54.629
No, you're wrong.

Maybe John could use his ring.

01:18:35.712 --> 01:18:39.799
No. It would take a billion rings
to put a dent in the Zeta force.

01:18:39.883 --> 01:18:41.217
It can't be stopped.

01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:43.970
But maybe it can be re-directed.

01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:45.179
What are you saying?

on the Universe for me while I'm gone.

You've made me realize
the Green Lantern oath

01:19:05.825 --> 01:19:08.077
isn't just some silly rhyme.

01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:12.332
It means something after all.

01:19:58.044 --> 01:19:58.962
No!

01:20:02.048 --> 01:20:06.636
And why, whatever price
I have to pay, I'm okay with it.

01:20:15.770 --> 01:20:17.814
Maybe the Guardians
made the right choice

01:20:17.897 --> 01:20:19.649
by making me a Green Lantern.

01:20:24.612 --> 01:20:25.613
[groans]

01:20:28.324 --> 01:20:30.910
But killing you isn't the way.

01:20:30.994 --> 01:20:33.746
John, the beam's locked in.

01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:36.499
We've tried everything we can think of.

01:20:36.582 --> 01:20:38.501
But we cannot stop it from here.

01:20:45.091 --> 01:20:46.509
[laughing]

01:20:46.592 --> 01:20:50.513
John, you're too soft to be a Lantern.

01:21:04.569 --> 01:21:06.404
[breath trembling]

01:21:06.487 --> 01:21:07.447
[thuds]

01:21:18.416 --> 01:21:20.543
[beeping]

01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:24.505
[powering up]

01:21:28.384 --> 01:21:29.844
[laughs]

01:21:30.386 --> 01:21:32.388
You're too late.

01:21:35.808 --> 01:21:36.893
[exhales]

01:21:45.151 --> 01:21:46.069
Look!

01:21:51.157 --> 01:21:53.117
[sweeping music playing]

01:22:03.419 --> 01:22:04.796
For you Alanna.

01:22:18.601 --> 01:22:21.687
For a Rannian, he was very brave.

01:22:25.274 --> 01:22:28.111
Thanks for saving my life.

01:22:30.404 --> 01:22:32.323
I had to kill my best friend.

01:22:34.867 --> 01:22:36.786
I don't know how I'm supposed
to live with that.

01:22:38.996 --> 01:22:41.791
We're all forced to do things
we don't want to.

01:22:41.874 --> 01:22:44.127
We can't beat ourselves up over it,

01:22:45.378 --> 01:22:47.797
as long as we do them
for the right reasons.

01:23:28.504 --> 01:23:30.089
Thanks for the ride, Shayera.

01:23:31.424 --> 01:23:33.676
Now, there's just
one more thing left to do.

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.929
Rebuild the Green Lantern Corps.

01:23:37.805 --> 01:23:40.516
[sweeping music playing]

01:23:51.194 --> 01:23:53.112
I hope to see you soon, John Stewart.

01:23:54.697 --> 01:23:57.533
Thanagar will need a Green Lantern
to help watch over it.

01:24:07.335 --> 01:24:08.753
[engine starts]

01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:30.149
Congratulations, hero.

01:24:30.233 --> 01:24:31.734
You're a Green Lantern.

01:24:32.401 --> 01:24:33.402
How's it feel?

01:24:33.486 --> 01:24:34.487
I'm starving.

01:24:35.571 --> 01:24:39.158
Let's get something to eat
and toast our absent friends.

01:24:40.326 --> 01:24:41.744
And maybe a few new ones.

01:24:52.922 --> 01:24:55.132
[closing tune playing]
