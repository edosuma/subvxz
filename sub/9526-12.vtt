Uncle Blazer?

06:58.502 --> 07:01.422
- No, uh, actually,
I'm going by "Chamilitary Man."

07:01.547 --> 07:03.424
Yeah, as in Chamillionaire's
rap group.

07:03.549 --> 07:04.675
You remember him, right?

07:04.800 --> 07:05.926
- You gotta get
out of there, dude.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.511
He's a cop.
He's there.

07:07.636 --> 07:08.846
- And there was all
this loud commotion outside.

07:08.971 --> 07:11.640
- Oh, poop...
and pee mixed together.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.517
- So I went to go see-
- I don't care, Nate.

07:13.642 --> 07:15.060
I just buried one of
my best friends on the force.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.645
I'm not in the mood
for your drama.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.064
- God, Dad, I'm sorry.
- Okay, just shut up.

07:19.189 --> 07:21.358
Turn off this crap music
and put out the bourbon.

07:21.483 --> 07:24.111
I got half the force
coming over here.

07:24.236 --> 07:25.988
- Oh, dude.
- What?

07:26.113 --> 07:28.449
Oh, my god.
Black Ops Agent Blue Blazer.

07:28.574 --> 07:31.660
The place is crawling
with popozaos.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.121
Popozaos everywhere.
Over.

07:34.246 --> 07:37.124
[electronic music]

07:37.249 --> 07:41.336
<i>I!'</i>

07:41.462 --> 07:43.255
- Guys.
I'm trapped in the closet.

07:43.380 --> 07:44.798
You gotta get me
outta here fast.

07:44.923 --> 07:46.800
- Okay, well,
plans are hard to think of,

07:46.925 --> 07:49.845
so it might
take us a minute.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.474
- [screams]
- [screams]

07:58.562 --> 07:59.897
- [screams]
- Oh! Ah! Ah!

08:00.022 --> 08:01.440
Ah! Ah!
Stop, you little-

08:01.565 --> 08:02.900
Ow, you bitch!

08:03.025 --> 08:04.443
- Away from the door!
Away from the door!

08:04.568 --> 08:07.237
- Ow, ow!
Dude, I'm not here to hurt you.

08:07.362 --> 08:10.491
I'm just here to erase
DeputyDong's a-account, okay?

08:10.616 --> 08:12.242
[cries]
Ah...

08:12.367 --> 08:14.078
Ah, my roots.

08:14.203 --> 08:16.455
- Delete my dad's account?
- [exhales]

08:16.580 --> 08:18.707
- That would destroy him.
Yeah, I'm in.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.417
- You are?
- Oh, completely.

08:20.542 --> 08:22.044
He made me drop out
of design school

08:22.169 --> 08:24.129
because he didn't like
the "offensive photos"

08:24.254 --> 08:25.923
on my lnstagram account,
but I know

08:26.048 --> 08:27.633
it's really because
he doesn't like my lifestyle.

08:27.758 --> 08:29.134
- Your lifestyle.
Sure, sure.

08:29.259 --> 08:30.552
- Not to mention
he's constantly throwing around

08:30.677 --> 08:32.386
that hate speech 24/7

08:32.513 --> 08:34.515
with all his friends
on that stupid gaming system.

08:34.640 --> 08:35.849
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
the guy

08:35.974 --> 08:38.644
likes to throw
the (mouths) f----t word around.

08:38.769 --> 08:41.980
- Well, I know where
he keeps the stupid Nintendo.

08:42.106 --> 08:43.941
- Okay, it's not
a Nintendo, actually.

08:44.066 --> 08:45.484
And Nintendos aren't stupid.

08:45.609 --> 08:47.569
They're actually one
of the flawless machines

08:47.694 --> 08:48.862
of our generation.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.697
- Okay, I think we need
to figure out

08:50.823 --> 08:52.866
which closet
Blake's trapped in...

08:52.991 --> 08:55.369
- Yes, right.
- And then tunnel.

08:55.494 --> 08:57.496
I've already started
right here.

08:57.621 --> 08:58.872
But, you know,
the more I think about it,

08:58.997 --> 09:00.082
the more that that's
a horrible plan

09:00.207 --> 09:01.208
'cause that might
take too long.

09:01.333 --> 09:02.960
Damn it.
- Yeah, nice.

09:03.085 --> 09:04.711
- [over radio] Change of plans.
- Nice imagination, though.

09:04.837 --> 09:06.296
- Yeah. What?
- Who is this? Who is this?

09:06.421 --> 09:08.090
- I'm a child at heart.
Hey-Who is this?

09:08.215 --> 09:09.216
- It's your best friend,
Blake.

09:09.341 --> 09:10.425
- I don't know a Blake.

09:10.551 --> 09:11.677
I know a Black Ops
Blue Blazer.

09:11.802 --> 09:13.137
Is this him?
- No.

09:13.262 --> 09:14.471
Actually, I changed my name.
You know that.

09:14.596 --> 09:15.848
It's Chamilitary Man.

09:15.973 --> 09:17.391
- Chamilitary Man
is a horrible name,

09:17.516 --> 09:18.892
so we're going by Blue Blazer.
- Horrible.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.019
- Go ahead.
We'll accept the charges. Over.

09:21.145 --> 09:22.437
- Change of plans,
all right?

09:22.563 --> 09:24.231
I got a man-boy here
on the inside helping me

09:24.356 --> 09:25.649
with the mission, okay?
- A man-boy?

09:25.774 --> 09:27.734
- This place is crawling
with cops, guys.

09:27.860 --> 09:29.361
I'm serious.
There's tons of 'em in here.

09:29.486 --> 09:31.697
So I just need you
to buy me some time,

09:31.822 --> 09:33.991
and then we'll get
this mission accomplished.

09:34.116 --> 09:35.284
All right?
Over and out.

09:35.409 --> 09:36.994
That's an order.
- Okay.

09:37.119 --> 09:38.620
And we will buy you time
with the cops,

09:38.745 --> 09:40.706
now over and out.
- Over and out.

09:40.831 --> 09:42.708
- Okay, over-It was
over and out when I said it.

09:42.833 --> 09:44.835
- Can I comb your hair?
- Over and out. What?

09:44.960 --> 09:46.044
- Blake,
stop encouraging him.

09:46.170 --> 09:47.462
Okay, just let him do it.

09:47.588 --> 09:48.589
- I am letting him do it.
Over and out.

09:48.714 --> 09:49.923
- Over and out.
- Roger that.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.216
- That was Blake.
- I know, I know.

09:51.341 --> 09:52.509
I got an idea.
I got an idea.

09:52.634 --> 09:53.969
Look, we're gonna
go up there.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.095
We're gonna say
we're exterminators, right?

09:55.220 --> 09:56.263
'Cause we look the part.

09:56.388 --> 09:57.723
So what's, like,
a local animal?

09:57.848 --> 09:59.516
Like a-a vulture!

09:59.641 --> 10:01.393
A vulture flew in a window
around the back of the house.

10:01.518 --> 10:02.686
We saw it.
We're here to kill it.

10:02.811 --> 10:04.062
- Dude, that is smart.
- Thank you.

10:04.188 --> 10:05.981
- Oh, my god.
Yeah, we're like-

10:06.106 --> 10:07.399
We're like
vulture exterminators.

10:07.524 --> 10:09.067
- Yes, exactly.
- That's really smart.

10:09.193 --> 10:10.527
That's a really good idea.
- I appreciate you-

10:10.652 --> 10:12.487
- Also, I think
I have a better one.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.865
Yeah, hi.
We are black ops.

10:14.990 --> 10:17.743
I am Secret
Special Agent DeMamp,

10:17.868 --> 10:19.578
and this is...

10:19.703 --> 10:20.996
- The Exterminator.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.749
- And we're here
for the party.

10:23.874 --> 10:25.626
- So you guys
knew Ramirez, huh?

10:25.751 --> 10:27.044
Were you at the wake, or-
- Yes.

10:27.169 --> 10:30.047
We-we were
at the wake big-time,

10:30.172 --> 10:33.592
and we know Ramirez
from police academy.

10:33.717 --> 10:35.677
- Oh, yeah, a lot of us
went there too.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.138
I don't recognize you guys.
- And I don't recognize you

10:38.263 --> 10:40.974
from the black ops academy
that we know Ramirez from.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.517
- Yeah, I never heard
of that.

10:42.643 --> 10:44.186
- Well, then I guess
we're doing our job.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.812
[both laugh]
- It's a secret.

10:45.938 --> 10:47.564
It's a secret sect.
It's like-

10:47.689 --> 10:48.815
It's like Skull and Bones

10:48.941 --> 10:50.943
and also other
secret Illuminati.

10:51.068 --> 10:52.361
- The Ya-Ya Sisterhood.

10:52.486 --> 10:54.279
- We carry guns instead
of traveling pants.

10:54.404 --> 10:55.864
- Yeah.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.532
- I can't believe
that dickhead's dead.

10:57.658 --> 11:00.953
- What?
- Dickhead?

11:01.078 --> 11:03.247
[laughs] You guys
really did know Ramirez.

11:03.372 --> 11:04.957
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

11:05.082 --> 11:06.083
- Yeah.
- Come on in.

11:06.208 --> 11:07.584
- Yeah.
- Ramirez.

11:07.709 --> 11:10.587
What a dickhead.
- Total dickhead, man.

11:10.712 --> 11:12.422
You forget how much
of a dickhead he is.

11:12.547 --> 11:15.676
Ramirez, the old bitch.

11:15.801 --> 11:17.094
The old dickhead.
- Yes.

11:17.219 --> 11:18.637
He's definitely
more of a dickhead

11:18.762 --> 11:21.974
than a bitch.
- Guys, what's your status?

11:22.099 --> 11:24.226
- So let me-let's-
- Yeah, we should take it.

11:24.351 --> 11:27.896
It's probably-ugh-
the chief.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.022
- Hey, yeah, come on.
Come on.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.232
Hey.
[overlapping chatter]

11:30.357 --> 11:31.900
- All right, all right,
all right.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.652
- What's up, dude?
- Right on, right on, right on.

11:33.777 --> 11:36.989
Guys, fellas,
this is my dog, Nate Dogg,

11:37.114 --> 11:38.573
and, well,
he's gonna help us

11:38.699 --> 11:39.866
get to DeputyDong's
console.

11:39.992 --> 11:41.702
- Yeah, I fucking hate
that thing.

11:41.827 --> 11:43.829
- Yeah, okay.
- Oh, all right.

11:43.954 --> 11:45.414
- Yeah.
It's cool. It's cool.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.165
And we understand,
and we get it,

11:47.291 --> 11:49.918
and it's cool to be
who you are as a person.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.420
And I've seen <i>Milk.</i>
- Yep.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.338
- SQ-
- What are you talking about?

11:53.463 --> 11:54.965
- We just need you guys
to kind of

11:55.090 --> 11:56.591
make a little scene
in here, right?

11:56.717 --> 11:58.635
And so we can kind of sneak
into the man cave.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.345
- Hey, I'm gonna hit the head.
Grab me a beer.

12:00.470 --> 12:01.930
- Uh, um-

12:02.055 --> 12:03.765
Shut it, shut it,
shut it, shut it.

12:03.890 --> 12:04.975
- Whoa.
- Jesus, Dad.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.226
Don't you knock or something?

12:06.351 --> 12:07.477
What if I'd been
pinching a loaf?

12:07.602 --> 12:09.021
- Damn it, Nate.
Lock the door then.

12:09.146 --> 12:10.522
And what the hell
are you doing in here?

12:10.647 --> 12:12.441
- Just shaving my pubes
into a flame design.

12:12.566 --> 12:13.692
- Jesus, never mind.

12:13.817 --> 12:15.068
I'll go piss in the yard.

12:15.193 --> 12:17.946
- They look good.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.324
- Dude, that was amazing.
- Oh, my god.

12:20.449 --> 12:21.867
- How'd you just come up
with that on the fly'?

12:21.992 --> 12:24.953
- Oh, no, that's something
I actually do.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.288
Flame on, bitches.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.956
- Okay, wow.
- What?

12:28.081 --> 12:29.374
- No.
- What are you doing?

12:29.499 --> 12:31.293
- Yeah!
You're packing heat.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.420
That's what that is.
- Thanks, man.

12:33.545 --> 12:34.671
- Come here, give me some skin.
- Hell, yeah.

12:34.796 --> 12:36.214
- Mm-hmm.
- Dude, pube art is-

12:36.340 --> 12:38.342
ls, like,
back in a big way.

12:43.513 --> 12:46.516
- So I am gonna sew
these pants together,

12:46.641 --> 12:47.726
and then we'll both be
wearing them at the same time.

12:47.851 --> 12:49.311
- Huh?
- And then you're gonna

12:49.436 --> 12:51.688
bend over in front of me
and hide in the clothes basket.

12:51.813 --> 12:53.023
We'll put all the clothes
on top of you.

12:53.148 --> 12:54.608
- I bend over?

12:54.733 --> 12:57.110
- Is that a hard concept,
Mr. Cha-military Man?

12:57.235 --> 12:58.862
- It's actually
Chamilitary Man.

12:58.987 --> 13:01.907
Cha-Chamillionaire.
He was, like, huge, wasn't he?

13:02.032 --> 13:03.158
- I'm sorry.
Do I look like I care?

13:03.283 --> 13:04.284
- Really?
- Do you have a better idea?

13:04.409 --> 13:06.286
Come on.
Let's do it.

13:06.411 --> 13:08.121
- Now?
- Well, for a fitting.

13:08.246 --> 13:10.040
- All right, see if it fits.
- Make sure everything's tight.

13:10.165 --> 13:12.042
- Make sure it's tight
and fits, sure.

13:12.167 --> 13:13.835
Sure, we're talking about
the pants, right?

13:13.960 --> 13:16.088
- Excuse us, gents.

13:16.213 --> 13:18.131
Clink, clink, clink, clink-
- Listen up in the back.

13:18.256 --> 13:21.134
- We would like to honor
Ramirez's fallen soul

13:21.259 --> 13:26.056
with a traditional Irish cop
drinkin' song.

13:26.181 --> 13:29.684
- Hey, how 'bout it?
- Uh, Ramirez was not Irish.

13:29.810 --> 13:32.896
- He was not Irish,
but he was a traditional guy.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.689
Every-we used to get
the Shamrock Shakes

13:34.815 --> 13:36.316
with him every year, right?

13:36.441 --> 13:38.068
And traditionally,
cops are Irish.

13:38.193 --> 13:39.194
- Let's just sing the song.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.320
- Here we go.
- Mm-kay.
