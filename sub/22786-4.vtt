00:02.080 --> 00:04.920
&lrm;<i>In the daytime, I'm Marinette.</i>

00:05.040 --> 00:08.119
&lrm;<i>Just a normal girl with a normal life.</i>

00:08.240 --> 00:10.840
&lrm;<i>But there's something about me</i>
&lrm;<i>that no one knows yet.</i>

00:10.960 --> 00:12.440
&lrm;<i>Because I have a secret.</i>

00:13.360 --> 00:15.720
&lrm;<i>♪ Miraculous! Simply the best! ♪</i>

00:15.840 --> 00:18.720
&lrm;<i>♪ Up to the test when things go wrong! ♪</i>

00:18.840 --> 00:21.480

&lrm;<i>♪ Miraculous! ♪</i>

00:32.080 --> 00:35.120
&lrm;-This fencing gear really suits you.
&lrm;-Thank you, Tikki!

00:35.240 --> 00:39.320
&lrm;Let's hope wielding a sabre is easier
&lrm;than finding a helmet that fits!

00:39.440 --> 00:40.480
&lrm;[laughs]

00:41.520 --> 00:42.920
&lrm;I gotta ace these tryouts!

00:43.040 --> 00:46.240
&lrm;D'Argencourt is the most prestigious
&lrm;fencing academy in Paris.

00:46.360 --> 00:49.320
&lrm;I only have this one shot
&lrm;to get onto the team!

00:49.840 --> 00:53.400
&lrm;You've been reviewing the rules
&lrm;all weekend. It'll be great!

00:53.520 --> 00:56.800
&lrm;You're right. I'm gonna make
&lrm;quite an impression on Adrien!

00:59.880 --> 01:02.480
&lrm;Ah, here we go!
&lrm;This one should fit perfectly!

01:02.600 --> 01:05.360
&lrm;I am the fencing master, Mr. D'Argencourt.

01:05.480 --> 01:09.040
&lrm;As I'm sure you're aware, we have
&lrm;only one open spot on the team this year.

01:09.160 --> 01:12.280
&lrm;So, to select the best candidate,
&lrm;I will observe the beginners

01:12.400 --> 01:15.240
&lrm;performing attacks
&lrm;on the experienced students.

01:16.040 --> 01:18.840
&lrm;-Where's Adrien?
&lrm;-Get into position.

01:20.520 --> 01:23.640
&lrm;-Seems you're looking for someone?
&lrm;-I thought Adrien was here.

01:23.760 --> 01:26.480
&lrm;A boy this tall, blond,
&lrm;nice, super handsome.

01:27.160 --> 01:29.440
&lrm;Thanks for the compliments!

01:29.640 --> 01:31.400
&lrm;I didn't know you were into fencing.

01:31.600 --> 01:36.080
&lrm;Adrien! Nice to fencing! I'm totally
&lrm;into you! Er... I mean, nice to see you!

01:36.280 --> 01:38.120
&lrm;Yeah, I'm totally into fencing!

01:38.520 --> 01:40.520
&lrm;[Adrien chuckles]
&lrm;[Marinette giggles]

01:40.640 --> 01:41.880
&lrm;Get into position!

01:45.440 --> 01:48.960
&lrm;Bend your knees then stretch
&lrm;your left foot back, turned outwards.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.520
&lrm;Perfect.
&lrm;Now put your sabre forward, like this.

01:54.120 --> 01:55.160
&lrm;[giggles]

01:55.360 --> 01:56.680
&lrm;Greet each other!

02:01.280 --> 02:04.600
&lrm;<i>En garde ! Prêts ? Allez !</i>

02:11.480 --> 02:14.240
&lrm;Go on, Marinette!
&lrm;You're supposed to touch me!

02:14.440 --> 02:16.640
&lrm;Touch you? Yeah.

02:20.440 --> 02:23.440
&lrm;<i>Attaque. Touche. Point ! </i>&lrm;Continue!

02:24.040 --> 02:26.160
&lrm;-Thanks!
&lrm;-All I did was lunge.

02:26.360 --> 02:28.920
&lrm;You've got good reflexes! &lrm;<i>En garde !</i>

02:30.520 --> 02:31.640
&lrm;<i>Prêt ? Allez !</i>

02:36.040 --> 02:38.880
&lrm;Attack, &lrm;<i>paré</i>&lrm;, riposte, counter-attack.
&lrm;It's your point.

02:39.080 --> 02:42.280
&lrm;-I don't get it. You hit me first.
&lrm;-With sabre fencing,

02:42.480 --> 02:46.720
&lrm;the attacker doesn't necessarily win
&lrm;the point. You took the initiative,

02:46.920 --> 02:50.080
&lrm;so you had priority.
&lrm;I could only parry or riposte, so I lose.

02:50.280 --> 02:53.200
&lrm;But everything's happening so fast,
&lrm;how can you know who won?

02:53.400 --> 02:57.680
&lrm;We don't always know for sure. That's why
&lrm;you can also abstain. Shall we continue?

03:01.080 --> 03:05.160
&lrm;Hey, you! Are you Mr. D'Argencourt,
&lrm;the fencing master?

03:06.480 --> 03:10.520
&lrm;-I want to join your team.
&lrm;-Only the best are admitted, you knave!

03:11.160 --> 03:13.840
&lrm;-And I was, everywhere I went.
&lrm;-&lrm;<i>Par le fer !</i>

03:14.040 --> 03:17.640
&lrm;This whippersnapper has nerve!
&lrm;All right! I may consider your admission,

03:17.840 --> 03:20.160
&lrm;shall you defeat one of my students!

03:23.120 --> 03:26.720
&lrm;Which one of you is the best combatant?

03:28.640 --> 03:31.800
&lrm;Adrien, please give our visitor
&lrm;a lesson in chivalry!

03:33.000 --> 03:34.520
&lrm;I shall, Master.

03:36.520 --> 03:37.800
&lrm;[boy] Cool.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.040
&lrm;Ha!

03:49.040 --> 03:51.400
&lrm;Great! There goes any chance
&lrm;of making the team!

03:51.600 --> 03:54.280
&lrm;-He's obviously better than everyone.
&lrm;-It's not over.

03:54.480 --> 03:56.080
&lrm;He still has to beat Adrien!

03:56.280 --> 04:00.160
&lrm;<i>En garde ! Prêts ?</i>

04:00.360 --> 04:01.280
&lrm;<i>Allez !</i>

04:06.600 --> 04:08.360
&lrm;<i>Simultané. Pas de touche.</i>

04:10.840 --> 04:12.920
&lrm;I could have sworn
&lrm;Adrien touched him first.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.840
&lrm;Not sure. Anyway,
&lrm;you never question the decision.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.800
&lrm;<i>En garde ! Prêts ?</i>

04:19.000 --> 04:19.959
&lrm;<i>Allez !</i>

04:26.520 --> 04:29.880
&lrm;-Uh... &lrm;<i>Abstention.</i>
&lrm;-What's happening?

04:30.080 --> 04:33.320
&lrm;Mr. D'Argencourt isn't sure who won
&lrm;so he'd chosen to abstain.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.680
&lrm;-This is a tight bout!
&lrm;-&lrm;<i>En garde...</i>

04:35.880 --> 04:38.600
&lrm;Wait! I request that we do it
&lrm;the old-fashioned way.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.760
&lrm;We'll be more at ease without the machine.

04:40.960 --> 04:42.720
&lrm;-Adrien?
&lrm;-Fine with me!

04:48.320 --> 04:50.840
&lrm;But how will we know
&lrm;who touched the other one first?

04:51.040 --> 04:53.720
&lrm;-By watching very closely.
&lrm;-&lrm;<i>En garde !</i>

04:54.800 --> 04:56.720
&lrm;<i>Prêts ? Allez !</i>

05:10.800 --> 05:12.640
&lrm;Is this what fencing's all about?

05:12.840 --> 05:15.520
&lrm;<i>Par le fer !</i>
&lrm;This is what fencing's all about!

05:26.480 --> 05:27.640
&lrm;Is that all you can do?

05:32.280 --> 05:34.320
&lrm;The fateful moment has arrived!

05:35.640 --> 05:37.240
&lrm;[moan]

05:44.800 --> 05:46.360
&lrm;Let me through! Move!

05:49.080 --> 05:50.080
&lrm;[groan]

05:57.800 --> 05:58.840
&lrm;Let's finish this off.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.960
&lrm;Who got the first hit? Who?

06:09.600 --> 06:12.680
&lrm;-Uh... I...
&lrm;-Who touched first? Tell us now!

06:13.280 --> 06:16.640
&lrm;I don't know. I think... it was... Adrien?

06:16.840 --> 06:20.680
&lrm;Ha, ha! Wonderful! This victory is
&lrm;an honour to D'Argencourt Academy!

06:21.520 --> 06:22.720
&lrm;[sigh]

06:29.400 --> 06:33.560
&lrm;-Are you sure, Marinette?
&lrm;-Uh... Well, I'm not entirely sure.

06:33.760 --> 06:36.400
&lrm;I mean, it looked like it was you,
&lrm;but it went so fast.

06:36.600 --> 06:40.480
&lrm;-I think he touched me first.
&lrm;-The referee has the last word.

06:54.760 --> 06:57.400
&lrm;A champion whose victory has been stolen.

06:57.600 --> 07:02.160
&lrm;Crushing defeat is the ideal steel
&lrm;with which to forge a blade of revenge.

07:08.520 --> 07:12.440
&lrm;Fly away, my little akuma,
&lrm;towards this spite and petulance

07:12.640 --> 07:15.000
&lrm;and evilise that fencer!

07:19.080 --> 07:21.200
&lrm;I'm going to offer him a decisive match!

07:28.600 --> 07:30.640
&lrm;Hey, wait! Your sabre!

07:43.200 --> 07:47.400
&lrm;Let's do a... decisive... match?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.040
&lrm;What's the point? You won.

07:50.240 --> 07:53.960
&lrm;There's no such thing as a second chance
&lrm;in my family. Goodbye.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.640
&lrm;Hey! What's your name?

07:59.840 --> 08:02.200
&lrm;You might get on the fencing team
&lrm;after all.

08:04.320 --> 08:05.680
&lrm;Follow that car!

08:08.200 --> 08:09.520
&lrm;An akuma!

08:19.440 --> 08:22.480
&lrm;Better capture it
&lrm;before it turns someone into a villain!

08:22.680 --> 08:25.800
&lrm;-At your service, Marinette!
&lrm;-Quick! Adrien is in danger!

08:27.120 --> 08:29.320
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

08:29.520 --> 08:31.080
&lrm;Ha!

08:52.160 --> 08:54.840
&lrm;<i>I'm not available. Leave a message.</i>

08:55.040 --> 08:58.760
&lrm;Mother, you thought I was good enough,
&lrm;but... I lost.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.200
&lrm;I won't be joining
&lrm;the D'Argencourt Academy.

09:12.240 --> 09:14.840
&lrm;Riposte, I am Hawk Moth.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.160
&lrm;I'm giving you a second chance to prove

09:17.360 --> 09:19.280
&lrm;that&lrm;<i> you</i>&lrm; are the best fencer of all!

09:19.480 --> 09:23.600
&lrm;But in return, you must bring me
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.

09:23.800 --> 09:27.200
&lrm;On my honour, Hawk Moth.
&lrm;I shall be victorious!

09:40.080 --> 09:43.280
&lrm;She's the only daughter
&lrm;of a family of prestigious fencers.

09:43.480 --> 09:47.000
&lrm;Her mother and grandfather were champions.
&lrm;I've read about them before!

09:47.200 --> 09:50.160
&lrm;She and her mother just moved to Paris!
&lrm;How incredible!

09:59.440 --> 10:02.720
&lrm;I'm taking you up on your offer
&lrm;of a decisive match!

10:03.480 --> 10:07.120
&lrm;I can't fight you like this.
&lrm;You're not... yourself!

10:07.760 --> 10:09.480
&lrm;-Fight!
&lrm;-Halte, Riposte!

10:09.680 --> 10:11.120
&lrm;You may seek your revenge,

10:11.320 --> 10:15.280
&lrm;but only after you take hold of Ladybug
&lrm;and Cat Noir's Miraculous first.

10:15.480 --> 10:17.200
&lrm;Understood, Hawk Moth.

10:19.680 --> 10:23.520
&lrm;Where do you think you’re going?
&lrm;Stay there, nice and patiently.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.240
&lrm;How'd you like to start a duel with me?

10:31.160 --> 10:32.400
&lrm;It's merged with her hand!

10:36.000 --> 10:38.680
&lrm;Give me a moment, Adrien.
&lrm;I must finish her off first!

10:38.880 --> 10:41.960
&lrm;But don't worry. I haven't
&lrm;forgotten about you! I won't be long!

10:47.920 --> 10:50.760
&lrm;Don't let her close in on you!
&lrm;Fight back!

10:52.560 --> 10:55.840
&lrm;Thank you! But now, get out of here!
&lrm;She doesn't deserve you!

11:00.240 --> 11:01.520
&lrm;Watch out, Ladybug!

11:07.440 --> 11:08.760
&lrm;-Ouch!
&lrm;-Are you hurt?

11:09.360 --> 11:10.840
&lrm;-I'm fine.
&lrm;-I've gotta get you

11:11.040 --> 11:14.280
&lrm;-as far away from that girl as possible!
&lrm;-Sounds like a plan!

11:24.520 --> 11:27.160
&lrm;-What kind of fencing was that?
&lrm;-Nothing like I've seen.

11:27.360 --> 11:30.120
&lrm;It'll be hard for me
&lrm;to protect you and fight.

11:31.800 --> 11:36.120
&lrm;-Where are you Cat Noir?
&lrm;-Maybe he's... busy?

11:38.760 --> 11:40.720
&lrm;Allow me to explain the rules to you.

11:40.920 --> 11:44.440
&lrm;You're not allowed to call it quits
&lrm;at any time. Adrien is mine!

11:44.640 --> 11:48.480
&lrm;I will defeat you, both of you.
&lrm;I am the best fencer!

11:48.680 --> 11:51.960
&lrm;Nobody's denying that. My friend Marinette
&lrm;made a bad call earlier.

11:52.160 --> 11:54.680
&lrm;He's right.
&lrm;Referee errors can happen in fencing!

11:54.880 --> 11:57.640
&lrm;You don't have to get
&lrm;so bent out of shape about it!

11:57.840 --> 12:00.040
&lrm;I'm sure she wasn't trying
&lrm;to humiliate you.

12:00.240 --> 12:04.800
&lrm;Of course not! Uh...
&lrm;I mean... I'm sure that was the case.

12:05.000 --> 12:09.920
&lrm;It's too late! The damage has been done.
&lrm;This time, I shall be the referee!

12:10.920 --> 12:12.400
&lrm;Stay back, Adrien!

12:14.480 --> 12:15.960
&lrm;[groans]

12:32.280 --> 12:35.200
&lrm;-You're sure taking some risks today!
&lrm;-Don't have a choice.

12:35.400 --> 12:36.840
&lrm;Ladybug needs me. Plagg...

12:37.040 --> 12:39.080
&lrm;Adrien! You OK?

12:39.280 --> 12:41.640
&lrm;Uh... yeah. You too?

12:41.840 --> 12:45.200
&lrm;I'll feel better once I know you're safe,
&lrm;far from that girl. Come on!

13:03.200 --> 13:07.120
&lrm;Akuma alert! You must leave now!
&lrm;Evacuate the premises calmly!

13:07.680 --> 13:09.320
&lrm;This way, ladies and gentlemen!

13:09.800 --> 13:14.680
&lrm;<i>Akuma alert. Ladybug and Cat Noir are</i>
&lrm;<i>expected to handle this emergency swiftly.</i>

13:14.880 --> 13:19.080
&lrm;<i>All visitors, kindly vacate the premises</i>
&lrm;<i>very calmly. Thank you.</i>

13:19.680 --> 13:22.360
&lrm;A safe place... A safe place... There!

13:23.320 --> 13:25.960
&lrm;I'm sorry,
&lrm;but at least you'll be safe in here.

13:26.560 --> 13:30.120
&lrm;-Please be careful, Ladybug!
&lrm;-Uh... I'll be fine, thank you.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.760
&lrm;And you stay out of harm's way, OK?

13:53.240 --> 13:56.160
&lrm;-Where did you hide Adrien?
&lrm;-You actually think I'd tell you?

13:56.360 --> 13:59.160
&lrm;This is just between you and me, Riposte!

13:59.360 --> 14:01.480
&lrm;You can't cut it? Fine.

14:01.680 --> 14:05.440
&lrm;I'm going to defeat you and take your
&lrm;Miraculous, then I'll go and find him!

14:05.640 --> 14:07.760
&lrm;I won't let you lay a hand on him! Ha!

14:09.120 --> 14:12.880
&lrm;-It's time we went and joined Ladybug!
&lrm;-Didn't you hear? She said to wait here.

14:13.080 --> 14:17.080
&lrm;-You can't disobey her!
&lrm;-I've got to help her! Plagg, claws out!

14:25.640 --> 14:27.440
&lrm;[groans]

14:41.880 --> 14:44.360
&lrm;-Cat Noir!
&lrm;-A fencing tournament at the Louvre?

14:44.560 --> 14:46.640
&lrm;-How come I wasn't invited?
&lrm;-Let me guess.

14:46.840 --> 14:50.000
&lrm;-You were at the groomer's again?
&lrm;-I was preening myself, milady.

14:50.200 --> 14:52.280
&lrm;You know how long
&lrm;it takes cats to get ready.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.160
&lrm;Ah!

14:59.880 --> 15:03.080
&lrm;-Check mate, Riposte!
&lrm;-You've got the wrong sport, Ladybug!

15:03.280 --> 15:06.680
&lrm;I think you mean... &lrm;<i>Attaque et point !</i>

15:06.880 --> 15:08.040
&lrm;Argh!

15:08.240 --> 15:09.520
&lrm;You OK, Cat Noir?

15:10.520 --> 15:11.400
&lrm;[evil laugh]

15:15.080 --> 15:16.120
&lrm;[alarm]

15:17.720 --> 15:20.360
&lrm;-Ladybug!
&lrm;-Ready to lose, Ladybug?

15:28.760 --> 15:30.120
&lrm;Cataclysm!

15:49.480 --> 15:51.160
&lrm;Of course!

15:55.080 --> 15:57.080
&lrm;The hour of revenge has struck!

15:57.280 --> 15:58.520
&lrm;No!

16:11.960 --> 16:14.000
&lrm;-He's gone!
&lrm;-Uh... Who?

16:14.200 --> 16:16.720
&lrm;Riposte is trying
&lrm;to get revenge on Adrien Agreste.

16:16.920 --> 16:22.000
&lrm;-I hid him inside this sarcophagus!
&lrm;-Maybe he was feeling claws-trophobic?

16:22.200 --> 16:26.040
&lrm;Let's look for him together, Ladybug,
&lrm;and finish this match!

16:31.440 --> 16:33.000
&lrm;Lucky Charm!

16:37.720 --> 16:39.680
&lrm;-A radiator!
&lrm;-Great!

16:39.880 --> 16:42.320
&lrm;-That should really heat things up!
&lrm;-Hmm.

16:46.080 --> 16:49.760
&lrm;-The akuma has to be in her sword!
&lrm;-Then why don't we get to the point?

16:50.800 --> 16:52.840
&lrm;-Ha!
&lrm;-Ah!

17:02.880 --> 17:04.560
&lrm;She's too quick!

17:09.440 --> 17:11.960
&lrm;-I need your belt, Cat Noir!
&lrm;-Get ready!

17:15.880 --> 17:16.960
&lrm;<i>En garde !</i>

17:18.920 --> 17:20.000
&lrm;<i>Prêt ?</i>

17:20.520 --> 17:21.920
&lrm;<i>Allez !</i>

17:26.560 --> 17:28.600
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you, little akuma!

17:33.040 --> 17:34.960
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

17:38.560 --> 17:39.680
&lrm;Gotcha!

17:40.720 --> 17:42.480
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

17:43.120 --> 17:45.040
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

17:54.600 --> 17:56.920
&lrm;-What happened?
&lrm;-Pound it!

17:58.760 --> 18:02.600
&lrm;Gotta go. Have a vet's appointment!
&lrm;Take care of the young lady, will ya?

18:04.800 --> 18:06.280
&lrm;Everything's OK!

18:12.200 --> 18:13.440
&lrm;Claws in.

18:14.360 --> 18:17.480
&lrm;Oh! All this sport has made me hungry!

18:17.680 --> 18:19.080
&lrm;Later! Shh!

18:20.920 --> 18:23.720
&lrm;-You go ahead. I have to find someone.
&lrm;-Thanks.

18:24.960 --> 18:26.920
&lrm;-Where could he have gone?
&lrm;-Ladybug!

18:28.800 --> 18:30.880
&lrm;-There you are!
&lrm;-Yeah, I'm sorry.

18:31.080 --> 18:33.560
&lrm;I thought it'd be better to go
&lrm;before Riposte came.

18:33.760 --> 18:36.960
&lrm;Besides, I hate to be locked up.

18:37.840 --> 18:40.280
&lrm;I'm so sorry! You did the right thing.

18:43.200 --> 18:46.400
&lrm;So, uh, so Cat Noir
&lrm;finally turned up, huh?

18:46.600 --> 18:51.800
&lrm;Yes, thankfully! Between you and me,
&lrm;he's much better than me at fencing!

18:52.000 --> 18:54.840
&lrm;-And... Riposte?
&lrm;-The girl is safe.

18:55.720 --> 18:57.640
&lrm;Oh, no! I'm about to change back!

18:59.440 --> 19:01.960
&lrm;You should be the one to return that.

19:08.160 --> 19:09.720
&lrm;Bug out!

19:13.920 --> 19:15.800
&lrm;<i>The Akuma Alert has been called off.</i>

19:16.000 --> 19:19.840
&lrm;<i>The Louvre will soon be reopening.</i>
&lrm;<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>

19:22.360 --> 19:24.760
&lrm;I'm at the Louvre. Come when you can.

19:24.960 --> 19:26.280
&lrm;Excuse me.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.280
&lrm;Listen, I...

19:33.880 --> 19:35.120
&lrm;-I'm sorry.
&lrm;-I'm sorry.

19:37.440 --> 19:39.520
&lrm;Perhaps you'll agree
&lrm;to take this back now?

19:41.920 --> 19:44.760
&lrm;No. I lost. You keep it.

19:44.960 --> 19:48.360
&lrm;-I think the point was yours.
&lrm;-That's not what your friend saw.

19:48.560 --> 19:52.200
&lrm;Marinette can get flustered easily.
&lrm;She's kind and means well.

19:52.400 --> 19:56.200
&lrm;She'd never cheat. Today was
&lrm;her first ever experience with fencing.

19:56.400 --> 19:59.720
&lrm;-You like her a lot, huh?
&lrm;-Marinette? Yeah, of course.

19:59.920 --> 20:01.200
&lrm;She's a very good friend.

20:01.400 --> 20:04.560
&lrm;And you'll really like her too,
&lrm;once you get to know her.

20:04.760 --> 20:06.640
&lrm;Very good friend, huh?

20:06.840 --> 20:08.800
&lrm;That sounds like a good start to me!

20:09.000 --> 20:10.640
&lrm;Please, take it!

20:13.320 --> 20:15.920
&lrm;I'll be happy to get to know
&lrm;your friend Marinette.

20:21.280 --> 20:23.280
&lrm;My name's Adrien. What's yours?

20:24.320 --> 20:25.320
&lrm;Kagami.

20:29.840 --> 20:31.800
&lrm;Get ready for that decisive match!

20:32.000 --> 20:33.040
&lrm;I can't wait, Kagami!

20:42.120 --> 20:45.280
&lrm;At least now you know how much
&lrm;Adrien values your friendship.

20:45.480 --> 20:47.480
&lrm;I know. Great. So he likes me.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.600
&lrm;But I don't want him to just like me.
&lrm;I mean, I do. But, you know,

20:50.800 --> 20:53.120
&lrm;I want him to&lrm;<i> like</i>&lrm; me!

20:53.320 --> 20:56.000
&lrm;In that case, you might have to
&lrm;work on your fencing!

20:56.200 --> 20:59.440
&lrm;[laughs] On your guard, Tikki!

20:59.640 --> 21:01.840
&lrm;[laughter]
