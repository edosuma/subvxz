WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:03.003
GILES: Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

00:03.036 --> 00:05.639
Anya, what's wrong
with you?

00:05.673 --> 00:10.910
First you give me
this beautiful ring, and now
I can't wear it in public.

00:10.943 --> 00:13.513
-Don't you want
to get married?
-Yes.

00:13.547 --> 00:16.884
Come on, Tara.
I am so old enough
to do research.

00:16.917 --> 00:19.387
You do research now?

00:19.420 --> 00:22.323
Wanna cappuccino
and a pack of cigarettes
to go with it?

00:22.356 --> 00:24.358
Why should I care
about any of this?

00:24.391 --> 00:26.227
Because they'll take you away.

00:26.260 --> 00:28.861
I can't make you go to school,

00:28.896 --> 00:32.232
and I won't be found fit
to be your legal guardian.

00:32.265 --> 00:35.368
Since you've been back,
you haven't exactly been big

00:35.402 --> 00:39.539
with the whole range
of human emotions thing.

00:39.573 --> 00:42.276
I know you never loved me,
but you treat me like a man.

00:43.777 --> 00:46.947
(chattering)

00:49.216 --> 00:51.685
Um, everything on this table's
half off, including the table.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.686
Buy one eyeball,
get the second one free.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.023
Arrr! Careful, me mateys.

00:56.055 --> 00:59.527
These be fireflies
spat from a volcano

00:59.560 --> 01:01.695
off the coast of Kathmandu.

01:01.728 --> 01:04.432
Arrrg!
You're not a real pirate.

01:04.465 --> 01:07.468
Real pirates live on boats
and don't look stupid.

01:07.501 --> 01:11.572
(chuckles)
Ah, a salty swabbie.

01:11.605 --> 01:14.608
Maybe you be fishing
for the taste of me hook!

01:14.641 --> 01:18.111
Uh, hello, Ahab?
A little help, please?

01:18.146 --> 01:21.149
Arrrg! And help
ye shall have. Arrrg!

01:27.954 --> 01:30.757
So what are you
supposed to be?
An angel.

01:30.790 --> 01:32.793
Oh. Shouldn't you
have wings?

01:32.825 --> 01:35.295
Oh, no. This is
a special kind of angel
called a "Charlie."

01:35.329 --> 01:38.665
We don't have wings.
We just skate around with
perfect hair fighting crime.

01:38.698 --> 01:41.935
Where's your costume?
(scoffs)

01:41.968 --> 01:43.903
Like I'm six years old.
Halloween is so lame.

01:43.936 --> 01:46.240
But you get to dress up
and play games.

01:46.274 --> 01:49.343
Xander's gonna
teach me a new one after work,
called "Shiver Me Timbers."

01:49.377 --> 01:53.180
Ever play?
Uh, Dawn, Willow could use
some help in Magical Texts.

01:53.213 --> 01:55.248
(chuckles)
I'm all over it.

01:55.283 --> 01:57.251
How about you?
Ever play "Shiver Me Timbers"?

01:57.284 --> 02:01.322
I'm not really much
for the timber.
(chuckles)

02:01.355 --> 02:04.424
I'm just saying
you might want to
rethink the stereotype

02:04.457 --> 02:07.161
before someone turns you
into a toad.

02:07.194 --> 02:10.663
And while you're at it,
why don't you try removing
that broomstick from your--

02:10.698 --> 02:12.966
Dawn.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.635
Hey. Don't stop the invective
on account of me.

02:15.669 --> 02:19.806
If I see one more idiot
that thinks witches are all
hairy moles and rotten teeth--

02:19.840 --> 02:22.675
Excuse me.
Do you have any candy corn?

02:24.344 --> 02:27.146
Oh! Look at you.

02:27.181 --> 02:29.716
You are just
the cutest thing.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.819
-DAWN:
But I thought you said--
-I know. But look.

02:32.853 --> 02:35.188
With the hat
and the--the wart.

02:35.223 --> 02:39.860
Ah. Oh. Let's go
fill your tummy up
with sugary niblets, okay?

02:44.231 --> 02:46.966
(sighs)

02:47.000 --> 02:50.403
MAN:
Where the unicorn is?
Yeah. Grab it for me, would you?

02:50.437 --> 02:52.639
ANYA:
Buffy,

02:52.673 --> 02:54.741
uh, we're running low
on mandrake root.

02:54.775 --> 02:57.645
Check the basement.

02:57.677 --> 03:01.147
Don't blame me
if we have this conversation
over and over...

03:01.181 --> 03:03.683
and over...

03:03.717 --> 03:06.419
and over and over.

03:06.454 --> 03:07.655
Oh!

03:07.687 --> 03:11.425
Bell. Neck. Look into it.

03:11.459 --> 03:13.326
Come with a nice
leather collar, does it?

03:13.360 --> 03:15.528
What are you doing
lurking down here?

03:17.365 --> 03:20.834
Came through the tunnels.
Runnin' low on Berber weed.

03:20.867 --> 03:24.237
Stir it in with the blood.
Makes it all hot and spicy.

03:27.139 --> 03:29.543
What? I was gonna pay for it.

03:31.711 --> 03:35.748
I mean, no.
I was gonna nick it,
'cause that's what I do.

03:35.783 --> 03:38.852
I go where I please,
and I take what I want.
What's your excuse anyway?

03:38.885 --> 03:41.588
I thought you had it
to the brim with
customer disservice.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.924
One-time deal to help out.
And I mean straight time.

03:43.956 --> 03:47.227
No loop-da-loop, mummy hand
repeat-o-vision.

03:51.465 --> 03:52.966
Where's the mandrake root?

03:54.768 --> 03:56.670
Um, here.

03:58.805 --> 04:00.640
There are three
to a jar.

04:02.443 --> 04:07.247
Tend to go a bit wonky
if you cram 'em too close.
Thanks.

04:07.281 --> 04:10.283
Feel like a bit of
the rough-and-tumble?

04:10.318 --> 04:12.252
What?

04:12.286 --> 04:14.822
Me, you.

04:14.854 --> 04:17.257
Patrolling. Hello?

04:18.826 --> 04:22.262
Oh. Uh, I should stay.

04:22.295 --> 04:24.564
Maybe tomorrow.

04:24.598 --> 04:28.235
Hmm. It's not like
I don't already have plans.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.103
The Great Pumpkin
is on in 20.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.942
So much easier to talk to
when he wanted to kill me.

04:35.975 --> 04:37.810
(exhales)

04:39.779 --> 04:43.216
(sighs)
Oh! Go help Giles.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.855
What happened to Xander?

04:48.889 --> 04:51.992
He kept poking me
with his hook.
(bell dings)

04:52.024 --> 04:54.461
I sent him to Charmed Objects.
With luck, he'll poke
the wrong one

04:54.495 --> 04:56.963
and end up
in an alternative dimension,

04:56.997 --> 05:00.934
inhabited by a 50-foot Giles
that squishes annoying,
teeny pirates.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.637
We've got
a ton of bagging to do here.

05:03.670 --> 05:07.307
A-Actually, Spike had a really
good idea. You know,
maybe I--I should patrol.

05:07.341 --> 05:10.377
Buffy, you've been patrolling
every night this week.
Besides, it's Halloween.

05:10.411 --> 05:14.213
It's the one time
of the year the supernatural
threats give it

05:14.247 --> 05:16.315
a well-deserved rest--
as should you.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.519
Yeah? What about costumes
that take over your personality?

05:18.552 --> 05:20.853
Or wee, little, Irish
fear demony thingies?

05:20.887 --> 05:22.990
Yes, well, if anything
calamitous should happen,

05:23.023 --> 05:25.959
history suggests
it'll happen to one of us.
Right. Exactly.

05:25.992 --> 05:29.697
So, I should patrol
to avoid any of that.
And I'm bagging.

05:29.730 --> 05:33.401
(humming Pop Goes The Weasel)

05:36.737 --> 05:38.672
(giggling)

05:52.084 --> 05:55.355
(continues)

06:12.572 --> 06:14.442
(children chattering)

06:15.576 --> 06:18.278
(continue)

06:18.310 --> 06:21.048
* Happy Halloween

06:21.081 --> 06:23.350
(girl giggling)

06:23.382 --> 06:25.018
(chuckles)

06:25.052 --> 06:29.490
Give you something...
special this year.

06:31.223 --> 06:34.728
Hmm.
(humming)

07:35.689 --> 07:37.324
Come again.
(chuckles)

07:38.725 --> 07:40.793
(sighs)
In a zillion years.

07:40.827 --> 07:43.963
Store go boom. Arrr.

07:45.665 --> 07:48.168
That was the most incredible
thing I have ever experienced.

07:49.670 --> 07:52.805
Except for that.
What you all
did for me tonight,

07:54.675 --> 07:57.110
the astounding heaps
of money you helped me--

07:57.144 --> 08:00.848
-(clears throat)
-Us acquire.

08:00.880 --> 08:04.151
All I can say is,
I hope we make
as much tomorrow.

08:04.184 --> 08:07.687
-Tomorrow?
-Oh, post holiday clearance.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.723
The cornerstone of retail.

08:09.757 --> 08:12.425
-(whines)
-(all groan)

08:13.492 --> 08:14.862
(groans)

08:16.362 --> 08:17.865
Brooms all around then.

08:17.898 --> 08:21.067
Or I could whip up a jaunty
self-cleaning incantation.

08:21.100 --> 08:23.202
It'll be like Fantasia.

08:23.235 --> 08:26.505
We all know how splendidly
that turned out for Mickey.

08:26.540 --> 08:29.408
I think I'm a little more
adept than a cartoon mouse.

08:29.442 --> 08:32.044
And you have more fingers,
which is good

08:32.078 --> 08:36.850
'cause then there's no need
to wear those big, white gloves
to overcompensate.

08:36.884 --> 08:39.086
You know, if you had
a real peg leg,

08:39.119 --> 08:40.988
you wouldn't just have
a lame costume.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.023
You'd actually be lame,
which is completely different--

08:43.056 --> 08:47.027
-You do this every night?
-Every time I close out
the cash register.

08:47.059 --> 08:49.196
The dance of capitalist
superiority.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.700
I'm gonna marry that girl.

08:52.732 --> 08:54.366
BUFFY:
What?

08:54.400 --> 08:58.538
She's 15 and my sister,
so don't eve-- Oh.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.408
Hey, everybody.

09:02.442 --> 09:03.876
Can I, um...

09:05.645 --> 09:07.780
Uh,

09:07.815 --> 09:10.884
there's something Anya and I
want to tell you.

09:12.885 --> 09:15.121
Now?

09:15.154 --> 09:16.155
Now.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.126
We're getting married.

09:20.159 --> 09:21.928
Oh, my God.

09:21.961 --> 09:23.562
Congratulations.

09:23.596 --> 09:26.133
WILLOW:
That--That's--

09:26.166 --> 09:27.801
Wow.

09:27.835 --> 09:29.501
It's a big wow.

09:31.138 --> 09:34.741
I-- I thought
you were waiting
for the right moment.

09:37.344 --> 09:38.577
I did.

09:47.019 --> 09:49.155
(sighs)

09:49.188 --> 09:51.490
Here, have some money.
(chuckles)

09:53.426 --> 09:56.328
Did you know about this?

09:56.363 --> 09:59.966
No. Unless I blocked it
from my memory,

10:00.000 --> 10:02.302
much as I will Xander's
vigorous use of his tongue.

10:05.371 --> 10:07.841
Is that why
you're always
cleaning your glasses?

10:07.875 --> 10:10.677
So you don't have to see
what we're doing?
Tell no one.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.546
(moaning softly)
BUFFY:
Giles, this is--

10:15.215 --> 10:17.116
We have to do something.

10:17.149 --> 10:20.754
And he said he couldn't imagine
the rest of his life without me.

10:20.788 --> 10:24.456
And then he gave me this.
Which I'll be paying for
the rest of my life.

10:24.490 --> 10:28.161
Can I try it on?
Oh, absolutely not.

10:28.195 --> 10:31.932
Where I come from,
this sort of thing requires
much in the way of libation.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.866
God save the queen.

10:33.900 --> 10:37.437
Sorry we couldn't do
the big fancy. You kind of
caught us with our parties down.

10:37.470 --> 10:41.008
Oh, that's okay.
This is just the first
premarital celebration.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.777
There'll be lots more.
With gifts.

10:43.811 --> 10:46.446
Sure. Maybe we'll even
have time to decorate
for the next one.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.716
Why wait?
(speaking foreign language)

10:53.921 --> 10:56.222
(chuckles)

10:56.255 --> 10:59.491
This is so much better
than the way it usually looks.

10:59.525 --> 11:00.994
Thank you.

11:05.932 --> 11:09.501
The grocery store is still open.
We could have bought
decorations there.

11:09.535 --> 11:11.538
Why bother?
These are perfect.

11:11.571 --> 11:15.042
And extra biodegradabley.
In a couple of hours--
poof.

11:15.075 --> 11:18.846
No, they're-- they're great.
It's just...

11:18.879 --> 11:21.081
why use magic when you can
do something naturally?

11:21.114 --> 11:25.384
Well, you can
fight monsters naturally...
with sticks and stones.

11:25.418 --> 11:27.486
Don't recommend it though.

11:27.519 --> 11:30.222
That's different.
How?

11:30.256 --> 11:33.393
Becau-- Because
you're protecting people,

11:33.426 --> 11:35.327
keeping them from being hurt.

11:35.361 --> 11:39.066
Which makes them happy,
like pretty decorations
made Anya happy.

11:39.099 --> 11:41.168
(sighs)
That's not the point, Wil.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.536
Why are you being like this?

11:43.570 --> 11:46.373
This isn't about me.
This is so about you.

11:46.405 --> 11:50.509
You're always coming down
on me for-- for doing magic
that couldn't harm a fly.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.780
What's your problem?
Willow, I j-just wish
that you would stop

11:53.813 --> 11:55.381
and think about
what you're--

11:55.414 --> 11:59.286
Sorry. Just checkin'
on the chips.

11:59.318 --> 12:00.988
It's okay.
We're done.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.528
You're getting married. You.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.462
Me choking.
Oh, sorry.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.866
I just--
I can't believe it.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.536
It seems like only yesterday
you had to pay a girl
to date you.

12:16.568 --> 12:19.907
Like I'd ever pay--
(chuckles)
Define "date."

12:19.940 --> 12:22.475
I was only out of commission
for three months.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.812
How many other things
have changed
since I've been away?

12:24.845 --> 12:27.746
Oh, I got a tattoo.
What?

12:27.780 --> 12:31.217
Which is why
we told her no.
Just a little one?

12:31.250 --> 12:33.485
BUFFY:
Over my dead body.

12:33.519 --> 12:35.522
The kind
that doesn't come back.

12:36.623 --> 12:38.024
Fine.

12:39.692 --> 12:41.894
Congratulations.

12:41.928 --> 12:45.798
(chuckles)
You're very lucky
finding a guy like him.

12:45.832 --> 12:48.034
Not as lucky as me.

12:50.870 --> 12:54.106
-See you guys tomorrow?
-Oh. "Tomorrow"?

12:54.140 --> 12:56.943
Yeah. I'm sleeping over
at Janice's. Remember?

12:57.945 --> 12:59.479
That's tonight?

12:59.511 --> 13:01.981
No. It's on the other Halloween.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.451
Come on.
You said I could.

13:05.485 --> 13:07.453
Uh...

13:07.486 --> 13:09.589
Well, I-- I know I did.

13:09.621 --> 13:11.859
It's just, you know,
now with Xander's party--

13:11.892 --> 13:16.028
Oh, we're good, but you'll
have to get us some extra
gifts for our reception.

13:16.062 --> 13:19.966
-Yes, please.
-Uh, I-- I don't know. Giles?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.701
Uh, it's really not up to me.

13:23.635 --> 13:26.505
Come on.
It's four blocks away.
I'll walk straight over.

13:26.538 --> 13:28.942
Not like I'm gonna be
roaming the streets.

13:28.975 --> 13:31.311
Please?

13:47.059 --> 13:49.296
(bottle rattles)

13:49.328 --> 13:50.596
Hello?

14:04.844 --> 14:05.711
-Hey.
-Oh.

14:05.745 --> 14:08.081
-Perv.
-Sorry. I thought--

14:08.115 --> 14:11.484
(gasps)
Hey, Summers.

14:11.518 --> 14:15.587
Did you get over the wall okay?
Yeah. My sister thinks
I'm staying at your house.

14:15.621 --> 14:18.857
Ah. The Mominator thinks
I'm staying at yours.

14:18.892 --> 14:21.394
I can't believe they
fell for that one.
Like, own a TV.

14:21.427 --> 14:24.230
(chuckles)
So where are we meeting?

14:24.264 --> 14:26.832
The park.

14:26.865 --> 14:29.469
That's where
all the monsters gather
on Halloween.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.106
(heavy metal music plays)
Whoo-hoo!

14:35.107 --> 14:37.543
-Hey. Ow!
-Oops.

14:37.576 --> 14:39.778
Nice shot.

14:41.313 --> 14:43.115
Hey, baby.
Hey.

14:43.149 --> 14:46.086
What took you so long?
I had to stop
for crimes and misdemeanors.

14:46.119 --> 14:49.088
Zack, this is my friend Dawn
I was telling you about.

14:49.121 --> 14:51.390
Hello.
Ow.

14:52.259 --> 14:54.726
Hey. Justin.

14:54.760 --> 14:58.730
I know.
I've seen you around
at a couple of parties.

14:58.764 --> 15:00.332
I've seen you. too.

15:01.668 --> 15:05.072
Hey. We'll
catch you guys later.

15:05.105 --> 15:07.307
Alone at last.

15:07.340 --> 15:11.278
So, what do you guys
want to do?

15:17.484 --> 15:19.719
Yeah! Three points!
Whoo!

15:19.751 --> 15:23.056
(air hissing)
Witches don't really
look like that.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.591
-You got a lot
of witch friends?
-Uh, no.

15:25.625 --> 15:29.296
I mean from stuff
that I've read and stuff.

15:29.328 --> 15:33.066
Um, some of them are supposed to
be really pretty, and
you don't want to get them mad.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.767
New target.
Come on.
Whoo-hoo!

15:39.505 --> 15:41.941
(sighs)
So?

15:44.043 --> 15:46.413
He's okay.
(scoffs)
Ho hum okay,

15:46.446 --> 15:50.450
or, like,
"Oh, my God. I think
I'm gonna pee my pants" okay?

15:50.482 --> 15:51.650
Pee.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.624
So what's the verdict,
Captain?

15:57.657 --> 15:59.692
(in baby voice)
Is little Justin in love?

15:59.725 --> 16:02.695
I don't know.
She's cute.

16:02.729 --> 16:05.097
Well, congratulations
for having eyeballs.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.134
What about, uh,
you know,

16:07.167 --> 16:09.201
goin' all the way?
(giggling)

16:09.235 --> 16:14.474
Do you think that, uh,
that the moon and the stars
look lovely tonight?

16:14.506 --> 16:17.809
Hey, you think when we're done
with this juvie crap maybe
we can do something else?

16:17.844 --> 16:19.379
I'm getting kind of bored.

16:20.712 --> 16:22.414
Just one more.

16:31.191 --> 16:34.027
Anya is a wonderful
former vengeance demon.

16:34.061 --> 16:38.331
I'm sure you'll spend
many years of non-hell
dimensional bliss.

16:41.067 --> 16:44.803
Is she moving in with you?
Uh--

16:44.836 --> 16:48.540
You know, with your combined
incomes, you might think about
a down payment on a house.

16:49.841 --> 16:52.178
Like the kind you live in?
No rush.

16:52.211 --> 16:53.513
Oh, I'm sure you'll have
plenty to think about

16:53.546 --> 16:55.648
with the arrangements
for the wedding and such.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.350
You've got the rest
of your lives to plan
the rest of your life.

16:58.384 --> 17:00.019
(chuckles)
Yeah, yeah.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.922
JANICE:
No way.

17:02.955 --> 17:05.892
(scoffs)
You know who lives there?

17:05.924 --> 17:08.394
Old man Kaltenbach.
Crusty old bastard.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.497
Isn't he supposed to be
mental or something?

17:10.529 --> 17:13.900
Total loony tunes.
Pumpkins.

17:13.932 --> 17:16.769
ZACK:
Very dangerous.

17:16.803 --> 17:19.172
You go first.
Wha--
(chuckles nervously)

17:19.204 --> 17:21.772
Screw that.
Oh, come on.
Show us how brave you are.

17:21.807 --> 17:23.942
See those cute, little
girlie guts.

17:23.976 --> 17:25.545
Hey, lay off, man.
If she doesn't want to--

17:25.577 --> 17:27.279
I'll do it.
Go, Dawn.

17:28.580 --> 17:30.482
Look, you don't
have to do this.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.487
It's okay. I want to.

18:00.980 --> 18:02.648
(gasps)

18:02.682 --> 18:05.084
Shouldn't ought to
mess with those.

18:05.117 --> 18:07.253
Sometimes they bite.

18:07.287 --> 18:10.823
Get away from her.
Don't make me go kung fu
on you, man.

18:14.527 --> 18:17.596
Come on inside, kids.
Got somethin' special for ya.

18:18.998 --> 18:20.932
Daddy's got a treat.

18:24.002 --> 18:26.838
Cool.
No, no, no.

18:26.873 --> 18:29.008
We are so
not going in there.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.643
Dawn, tell them.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.486
Dude, where'd you get
the cool toys?

18:39.519 --> 18:42.454
Used to design 'em
back in '58.

18:42.489 --> 18:46.092
Nothin' would give me
more pleasure...

18:46.125 --> 18:48.094
than to see
a child's face

18:48.126 --> 18:50.663
light up when he'd
open one of mine...

18:50.697 --> 18:53.365
on a Christmas or a birthday.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.468
I was good.

18:55.501 --> 18:57.737
Jeepers. I was the best.

19:00.539 --> 19:03.276
And then that thing happened.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.678
One little mistake,

19:05.711 --> 19:07.713
and they took it
all away from me.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.249
They--

19:10.349 --> 19:12.984
They took my toys.

19:17.155 --> 19:19.692
Time for the treats.

19:19.726 --> 19:23.128
Who wants to help Daddy
in the kitchen?

19:23.162 --> 19:24.864
How about you, Sally?

19:26.699 --> 19:30.068
Uh, Sally's not much
for the cooking.
Why don't I give you a hand?

19:33.005 --> 19:35.307
Hands are good.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.376
Always use more hands.

19:38.778 --> 19:41.748
More hands.

19:41.780 --> 19:44.384
(Kaltenbach humming
Pop Goes the Weasel)

19:44.416 --> 19:46.085
Okay, I say we get
the funk out of here

19:46.117 --> 19:48.320
before "Satan" Claus tries to
stuff us up the chimney.

19:48.355 --> 19:50.757
(Pop Goes the Weasel playing)
What, and miss the big treat?

19:50.789 --> 19:54.326
That'll break the old guy's
"wittle" heart,
assuming it's still beating.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.328
She's right.
We should just
get Justin and go.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.397
Come on. The dude's
1,000 years old.

19:58.431 --> 20:01.534
What's he gonna do?
Drown us in his drool cup?
(continues)

20:01.567 --> 20:05.938
(stops)
Hey. Where's its head?

20:25.892 --> 20:27.759
Boo.
(snarls)

20:37.336 --> 20:39.238
(whimpers)

20:41.574 --> 20:44.009
(clattering)
What the hell was that?

20:47.314 --> 20:48.414
Justin?

20:56.923 --> 20:58.089
Justin?

20:59.157 --> 21:00.559
-(door opens)
-(gasps)

21:00.593 --> 21:02.828
-Let's go.
-What happened?

21:02.862 --> 21:04.596
I swiped his wallet
when he wasn't looking.
Come on.

21:06.999 --> 21:10.502
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

21:13.038 --> 21:16.008
(sighs)
Dude, that guy was rank.

21:16.041 --> 21:18.176
I bet a spritz of Dawn
will wash that right out.

21:18.210 --> 21:20.512
So what do you think?
Lunchables?

21:20.547 --> 21:24.784
Or should we go all the way
and turn 'em?
(girls giggling)

21:24.817 --> 21:27.619
So, I was thinking
maybe a June wedding,

21:27.653 --> 21:29.756
but then I remembered
that they always had

21:29.788 --> 21:31.958
the highest percentage
of calls for vengeance.

21:31.990 --> 21:33.692
So now I'm leaning towards
as soon as damn possible.

21:33.726 --> 21:35.126
I mean, mortal life
being so short,

21:35.161 --> 21:37.262
we gotta cram in as much
marital bliss as we can

21:37.296 --> 21:39.298
before we wither and die.

21:39.332 --> 21:41.200
I mean, there's just
so much to consider, though.

21:41.232 --> 21:44.936
I mean, planning the wedding
and new cars,
a house and babies.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.538
I mean, you have to
plan for babies,

21:46.573 --> 21:50.710
otherwise they'll just
run roughshod over
your entire existence.

21:50.742 --> 21:54.346
Yeah. You--
You gotta know what to call them
before they hit college.

21:54.381 --> 21:56.982
Ah. Rupert is
an exceptionally strong name.

21:59.885 --> 22:04.624
Yeah. If we want our progeny
to eat paste and have
their lunch money stolen.

22:04.656 --> 22:06.425
Hmm.

22:08.027 --> 22:10.229
Look, all that matters
is that they're happy.

22:10.261 --> 22:12.398
Everything else
is thick gravy goodness.

22:12.432 --> 22:16.403
I know.
I mean, I am the luckiest
ex-demon in the world.

22:16.435 --> 22:18.371
I mean, to be able to find
the one person

22:18.404 --> 22:20.673
in-in all dimensions
that I was meant to be with

22:20.707 --> 22:23.476
and-- and have everything
work out exactly
as I dreamed.

22:23.509 --> 22:27.278
I mean, how often
does the universe
allow that to happen?

22:33.452 --> 22:36.588
Air. Sweet mother oxygen.

22:36.623 --> 22:37.923
Are you okay?

22:38.891 --> 22:40.893
Yeah. I just--

22:43.095 --> 22:46.097
It's just I--
I didn't think
it'd be so much.

22:46.132 --> 22:48.768
But this is good.

22:48.800 --> 22:51.538
I mean, this is
love and celebration

22:51.570 --> 22:54.840
and moving forward.

22:54.874 --> 22:58.877
Anya's right.
This is the way
life's supposed to work out.

23:00.378 --> 23:03.715
Right. Deep pools
of ooey delight.

23:03.750 --> 23:06.018
(chuckles)
I'm wallowing,
not drowning.

23:06.051 --> 23:08.386
Definite wallow action.

23:09.955 --> 23:13.593
Okay. So, once more
into the breach?

23:13.625 --> 23:18.029
Oh. I think my breaches
are wearing a little thin.

23:18.064 --> 23:20.532
I'm gonna take Spike up
on that offer to patrol.

23:20.567 --> 23:23.269
Gotta be somethin' out there
cruisin' for a smack-down.

23:30.142 --> 23:32.744
So, you're, like,
what, a sophomore?

23:32.778 --> 23:36.715
(chuckles)
I wish.
Oh, freshman.

23:36.749 --> 23:40.086
Yep. Way down there
at the bottom
of the rung.

23:40.118 --> 23:45.324
Hmm. Actually, kind of under
those little rubber feet
that keep the ladder steady.

23:45.356 --> 23:47.727
Hey, those are important.

23:47.759 --> 23:51.730
Here. Spoils of war.
You earned it.

23:51.763 --> 23:54.432
I did?
Yeah, for keeping me steady.

23:55.934 --> 23:57.970
And so begins
her life of crime.

23:58.003 --> 24:00.138
Hmm. You're
a little late.

24:00.172 --> 24:03.174
I steal
all the time.
Really?

24:03.209 --> 24:07.779
Totally. I haven't
paid for lipstick
since... forever.

24:07.814 --> 24:10.916
Oh, be still, my heart.
Cute and bad.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.986
Yeah.
Bad to the bone.
(chuckles)

24:14.019 --> 24:16.055
More like frozen.
Here.

24:22.662 --> 24:25.964
Thanks.
My pleasure, Miss Summers.

24:28.299 --> 24:30.636
Hey. Where's Zack?

24:30.670 --> 24:33.172
He went to get the car.

24:33.204 --> 24:35.040
You guys got a car?

24:37.076 --> 24:38.644
Thanks for the ride.

24:44.083 --> 24:47.019
(clattering, giggling)

25:00.332 --> 25:02.201
(siren wailing)

25:05.371 --> 25:09.174
MAN:
You got the stretcher?
MAN 2: Yep. Watch your back.

25:09.208 --> 25:11.509
Coming through.
MAN 1:
All right. Let's go.

25:11.544 --> 25:13.378
I'm losing her pulse.

25:13.412 --> 25:15.381
MAN 1:
Let's get her in.

25:20.219 --> 25:22.253
(ringing)

25:22.288 --> 25:24.355
Summers residence.

25:24.390 --> 25:26.224
Oh. Mrs. Penshaw. Yeah.

25:28.059 --> 25:31.998
No, Dawn said she was
staying the night at your house.

25:32.030 --> 25:35.101
Well, ye-- yes, I realize that
now, but I don't believe
that you called to check--

25:36.935 --> 25:39.771
No, all right.
Let's just, um--

25:39.806 --> 25:41.574
Okay, if I--
if I hear anything
I'll let you know.

25:43.108 --> 25:44.542
(R&B music playing)

25:44.576 --> 25:47.747
(woman vocalizing)
* Yeah

25:49.715 --> 25:52.183
* You're the one that
got that something *

25:52.218 --> 25:55.253
-* You're the one that
got that something *
-(stops)

25:55.287 --> 25:57.455
Hey, we were just
getting our dance on.

25:57.489 --> 25:59.557
That was Janice's mother
on the telephone.

25:59.592 --> 26:02.028
Apparently Janice said
that she was staying
here the night.

26:02.060 --> 26:05.932
Ah. Dipping into the classics.
You gotta respect that.

26:05.964 --> 26:08.067
Is Buffy still outside?
Uh, no, no.

26:08.099 --> 26:10.737
She was getting antsy.
She went to go find Spike
to patrol.

26:10.769 --> 26:12.904
It's always nice
to be kept in the loop. Um,

26:12.939 --> 26:17.209
Xander, Anya,
you stay here in case
Mrs. Penshaw calls again.

26:17.242 --> 26:18.611
Willow, Tara,
you check downtown.

26:18.644 --> 26:22.513
I'll, uh, swing by Spike's,
see if I can catch Buffy.

26:23.750 --> 26:27.252
(giggling)
Oh.

26:28.453 --> 26:30.656
Don't do nothing I would, dude.

26:32.924 --> 26:35.260
Mmm.

26:35.294 --> 26:36.595
You're it.

26:39.464 --> 26:41.166
I love it when they run.

26:46.137 --> 26:47.173
So...

26:48.507 --> 26:49.607
Yeah.

26:52.611 --> 26:55.213
Ooh. It's cold.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.851
You okay?
You want this back?

26:58.884 --> 27:01.019
Nah.

27:01.053 --> 27:02.888
Cold doesn't really
bother me.

27:04.522 --> 27:06.659
What are you, Superman?
(chuckles)

27:06.692 --> 27:11.529
No, but I do have
a few special powers.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.669
Hey. Um,

27:16.702 --> 27:18.704
does this work?

27:18.738 --> 27:21.973
You gotta turn the ignition.

27:22.008 --> 27:25.544
Oh.
(ballad on radio)

27:25.576 --> 27:28.780
* Got me goin' on

27:28.815 --> 27:30.849
I love this one.
* Again

27:30.883 --> 27:33.384
Yeah. Another thing
we have in common.

27:33.419 --> 27:36.722
* Around my smile

27:36.756 --> 27:39.391
* And I got
a thoughtless feeling *

27:39.424 --> 27:41.626
(breathing erratically)
You're shaking.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.494
* Inside
It's cold.

27:47.232 --> 27:49.234
You want to go?

27:49.268 --> 27:52.171
N-No. It's just, um,

27:53.439 --> 27:55.907
what do you expect--
Shh.

27:58.509 --> 28:01.047
I just want to taste you.

28:07.553 --> 28:11.123
* I've got it goin' on

28:17.730 --> 28:21.633
* Got me goin' on again

28:24.403 --> 28:27.239
* Around my smile
Shiver me timbers.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.277
What?

28:31.309 --> 28:35.381
Um, nothing.
Just... wow.

28:35.413 --> 28:39.085
Oh, my God.
That was your first.

28:39.117 --> 28:42.288
Wh-What? No.

28:42.320 --> 28:45.057
It was.
That was your first kiss.

28:45.090 --> 28:48.094
Uh--
(chuckles)
I've been kissed before.

28:48.126 --> 28:51.430
I-- I kiss all the time.
Not that I'm a kiss slut.

28:51.462 --> 28:55.801
Just, you know, with--
with the lips and--and
the pressing together and stuff,

28:55.835 --> 28:57.736
hey, expert here.

29:00.839 --> 29:04.242
Okay, okay.
It was my first kiss.

29:04.276 --> 29:06.711
I know, I know.
I suck. My--

29:06.744 --> 29:09.248
My lips are dry
and my tongue's all horrible
and sticky,

29:09.280 --> 29:11.250
and I'm pretty sure
I drooled on you.

29:11.282 --> 29:14.486
So just please tell me
how awful it was.

29:14.519 --> 29:17.655
* I've got it goin'

29:17.689 --> 29:19.258
It was perfect.

29:22.028 --> 29:25.131
* I've got it goin' on

29:25.163 --> 29:28.334
* I'm giving cheers to you

29:31.938 --> 29:34.240
* Conversation

29:34.272 --> 29:36.342
* Use up again

29:36.375 --> 29:40.412
* Well, there's nothing
I can defend *

29:40.445 --> 29:44.182
* You just simply
don't understand *

29:44.215 --> 29:46.184
* Anyway

29:50.721 --> 29:53.459
Do they know
they're brother and sister?

29:53.491 --> 29:55.693
Do you think she's here?

29:55.727 --> 29:57.829
What?

29:57.864 --> 30:00.499
Do you think Dawn
might have come here?

30:00.531 --> 30:03.201
It's where I'd be
if I were 15 and on the lam.

30:03.234 --> 30:04.502
Really?

30:05.703 --> 30:08.875
Well, not me at 15,
'cause, hello, spaz.

30:08.907 --> 30:11.477
You?
Yeah. Hard to believe

30:11.509 --> 30:16.182
such a hot mama yamma
came from humble,
geek-infested roots.

30:16.214 --> 30:18.317
"Infested roots."
Trying to turn me on?

30:19.585 --> 30:21.420
I have to try now?

30:24.722 --> 30:26.959
Come on.
Let's look over here.

30:26.992 --> 30:29.127
Do you see her?

30:29.161 --> 30:31.163
No, there's too many people.

30:31.196 --> 30:33.199
Maybe we could ask
security to--

30:33.231 --> 30:35.534
No. That'll take
too long.

30:40.873 --> 30:43.741
One among many,
many fade to one.

30:43.775 --> 30:47.078
What are you doing? Wil.
I'm just gonna
clear the crowd.

30:47.113 --> 30:49.080
How?

30:49.115 --> 30:52.584
I'll just shift everyone
who isn't a 15-year-old girl
into an alternate dimension.

30:52.617 --> 30:54.586
What?

30:54.619 --> 30:58.423
No, it'll be for like
a fraction of a second.
They won't even notice.

30:58.457 --> 31:00.392
Wil, no, you can't.

31:00.425 --> 31:02.760
Why?

31:02.794 --> 31:04.596
Wh-- What if something
went wrong?

31:04.630 --> 31:06.999
Well, it won't.

31:07.032 --> 31:10.001
But wh-what would Giles say?

31:10.036 --> 31:12.604
(speaks foreign word)

31:12.637 --> 31:15.074
-(room falls silent)
-Are you taking his side now?

31:15.106 --> 31:17.375
(sighs)
This isn't about sides.

31:17.409 --> 31:20.246
You two have been talking
about me behind my back.

31:20.278 --> 31:23.348
No. God.
You know
how that makes me feel?

31:23.382 --> 31:26.384
Willow, you are using
too much magic.

31:26.417 --> 31:29.688
What do you want me to do?
Just-- Just sit back
and keep my mouth shut?

31:29.721 --> 31:31.623
Well, that'd be a good start.

31:33.825 --> 31:36.627
If I didn't love you
so damn much, I would.

31:36.662 --> 31:38.797
(speaks foreign word)

31:38.829 --> 31:40.266
-(sound resumes)
-Tara.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.434
* To go away

31:46.238 --> 31:48.307
* Doo, doo, doo-doo

31:48.339 --> 31:51.710
* I've started to see you
clearly today *

31:51.742 --> 31:53.912
(moans)

31:56.414 --> 31:58.784
(moans)

31:58.817 --> 32:00.719
* If you really loved me

32:00.751 --> 32:03.088
Ow.
* You know you'd stay

32:04.190 --> 32:05.324
Sorry.

32:06.692 --> 32:08.759
It's okay.

32:08.794 --> 32:10.461
As long as
it's not bleeding.

32:14.432 --> 32:17.502
Justin. Could we--

32:17.536 --> 32:18.869
It's just...

32:21.507 --> 32:24.809
God, you are so beautiful.

32:24.843 --> 32:28.814
* To keep me smiling

32:28.846 --> 32:34.452
* Looks like the night
has come to an end *

32:34.486 --> 32:38.423
* And yet
the sun is shining *

32:38.457 --> 32:41.826
* I know you start with

32:44.997 --> 32:47.865
Get your gear together.
We need to--

32:50.701 --> 32:53.338
Spike?

32:53.372 --> 32:57.808
You know,
in civilized cultures
that's called trespassing.

32:57.843 --> 33:00.046
Good thing
you're uncivilized.
(chuckles)

33:00.078 --> 33:02.314
We've got trouble.
Giles found you?

33:02.347 --> 33:06.184
Giles? No.
Was he looking for me?
Yeah, it's Dawn.

33:06.218 --> 33:08.819
Dawn? Wh-What happened?

33:08.854 --> 33:11.690
No, it's okay.
Giles was by here earlier
looking for you.

33:11.722 --> 33:13.991
Dawn and her little friend
pulled a Houdini.

33:14.026 --> 33:16.228
Up to a bit of candy-corn
mischief, I suspect.

33:16.261 --> 33:19.730
Wait. She's out there
running around by herself?

33:19.765 --> 33:21.700
Yeah, kids these days, eh?

33:21.732 --> 33:26.372
I did a sweep of the tunnels.
Giles is pokin' about
the cemetery.

33:26.404 --> 33:29.775
(sighs)
We have to find her.
I don't think she's in there.

33:38.549 --> 33:41.252
Mist, cemetery,

33:42.421 --> 33:44.490
Halloween.

33:44.522 --> 33:47.292
This should end well.
(groans)

33:51.363 --> 33:53.231
Bloody brilliant.

33:56.102 --> 33:58.970
(girl screaming)

34:07.145 --> 34:09.315
Dawn!
(grunts)

34:10.581 --> 34:12.550
Dawn, are you all right?

34:12.583 --> 34:15.121
Janice?
He bit me.

34:15.152 --> 34:18.456
-That jerk bit me.
-Like you weren't
asking for it.

34:18.489 --> 34:20.425
I feel certain
she wasn't.

34:20.458 --> 34:22.527
What do you know
about it, grandpa?

34:22.561 --> 34:24.396
-(snarls)
-Quite a bit, actually.

34:28.666 --> 34:31.068
(growls)

34:31.103 --> 34:33.572
(groaning)

34:41.280 --> 34:43.181
(groans)

34:45.416 --> 34:48.253
Dude, that sucks.

34:48.286 --> 34:52.458
(panting)
Dawn. Where's Dawn?

34:55.293 --> 34:58.697
Get off me!
Dawn, wait. Wait.

35:00.666 --> 35:03.235
Look, I thought
we could, you know,
like, hang out or something.

35:03.268 --> 35:05.471
Hang out?
Yeah.

35:05.503 --> 35:09.675
I mean, you're
not like other girls.
You're different.

35:09.708 --> 35:11.777
There's something special
about you.

35:11.809 --> 35:14.146
I knew it the first time
I saw you.

35:15.880 --> 35:18.583
I just want to
be close to you.
(gasps)

35:18.617 --> 35:20.952
Shh.

35:20.985 --> 35:24.623
It's okay.
It'll only hurt
for a second.

35:24.655 --> 35:27.193
I'll bet you say that
to all the girls.

35:27.226 --> 35:30.195
Giles?
(gasps)

35:30.228 --> 35:32.297
Now, you have a choice, son.

35:32.331 --> 35:34.465
We can do this the easy way,
or we can do this the har--

35:40.206 --> 35:43.074
(all growling)

35:50.215 --> 35:52.351
What were my choices again?

35:58.757 --> 35:59.925
(growling)

36:04.663 --> 36:06.831
So, this a private game,

36:06.864 --> 36:09.501
or, uh,
can anyone join in?

36:09.534 --> 36:11.702
Dawn, are you--

36:13.003 --> 36:15.840
Were you parking
with a vamp?

36:17.409 --> 36:19.545
I-- I didn't know
he was dead.
Living dead.

36:19.577 --> 36:22.880
-Shut up.
-How could you not know?

36:22.914 --> 36:25.483
-I just met him.
-Oh. Oh, so you were

36:25.516 --> 36:27.085
parking in the woods
with a boy you just met.

36:27.117 --> 36:28.853
We've seen each other
at parties.

36:28.887 --> 36:31.856
Shut up.
I don't believe you.

36:31.889 --> 36:33.858
Oh, like you've never
fallen for a vampire?

36:33.891 --> 36:35.994
That was different.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.762
It always is
when it's you.

36:37.795 --> 36:40.331
Uh, excuse me.
Can we fight now?

36:40.365 --> 36:43.302
Hey, didn't anyone come here
to just make out?

36:45.036 --> 36:47.072
Aw, that's sweet.
You run.

36:48.706 --> 36:50.708
You scream.

36:52.378 --> 36:54.413
(snarling, grunting)

36:57.815 --> 36:59.851
(grunting, yelling)

36:59.885 --> 37:01.387
Die, Slayer.

37:02.487 --> 37:04.856
Mm-hmm.

37:04.889 --> 37:07.759
Your sister's the Slayer?
I totally get it.

37:07.793 --> 37:09.894
I knew there was
something about you.

37:09.927 --> 37:11.597
(groans)

37:16.735 --> 37:18.003
Giles!

37:25.744 --> 37:28.414
-(snarling)
-(groans)

37:30.282 --> 37:33.684
What is
your malfunction, man?

37:35.119 --> 37:38.590
It's Halloween, you nit.
We take the night off.

37:38.623 --> 37:42.092
Those are the rules.
Me and mine don't follow
no stinkin' rules.

37:42.126 --> 37:44.094
We're rebels.

37:48.367 --> 37:50.436
No. I'm a rebel.

37:50.469 --> 37:52.471
You're an idiot.

37:56.375 --> 37:59.210
Give the lot of us
a bad name.

38:00.346 --> 38:01.847
(growls)

39:00.405 --> 39:03.041
-(light thud)
-(gasps)

39:05.210 --> 39:07.077
(rustling)

39:10.416 --> 39:11.583
Trick or treat.
(screams)

39:18.556 --> 39:20.025
Give me somethin'
good to eat.

39:20.057 --> 39:24.362
(breathing erratically)
I thought you really liked me.

39:27.032 --> 39:28.900
I do.

39:31.036 --> 39:32.704
And you like me, too.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.141
I do.

39:39.978 --> 39:42.047
-(thud)
-(groans)

39:51.255 --> 39:54.391
Sorry about the party.
Ah, don't worry about it.

39:54.425 --> 39:56.862
It gave me more time
to plan the bridal shower.

39:56.894 --> 39:59.364
Uh, where do we order
obscenely muscular
male strippers?

39:59.396 --> 40:02.967
Anya.
I'm kidding. Geez.

40:03.001 --> 40:05.536
(whispers)
We'll talk.
I guess I should bugger off.

40:05.570 --> 40:09.139
Something about big bads
not venturing far from
the crypts on Halloween.

40:09.173 --> 40:13.744
-Good fight.
-So, uh, big monster bashing?

40:13.778 --> 40:15.780
Sorry we missed it.

40:15.813 --> 40:19.150
As long as Dawn's all right.

40:19.184 --> 40:22.521
Yeah, that's what's--
I-- I think I'm gonna
turn in. Good night.

40:24.590 --> 40:26.958
Tara. Tara.

40:31.195 --> 40:33.297
How's your face?

40:33.331 --> 40:37.367
Oh, still ruggedly handsome.
"Grandpa" indeed. Ow.

40:38.869 --> 40:41.172
She's taking it
pretty hard.

40:41.206 --> 40:44.275
Well, it's not surprising.
Still, we can't ignore
this kind of behavior.

40:44.309 --> 40:47.445
Something needs to be done
before it spins out of control.

40:47.478 --> 40:50.916
You're right.
I'm glad you're here
to take care of it.

40:50.949 --> 40:53.018
Don't be too hard
on her, okay?

41:10.501 --> 41:12.336
We need to have a conversation.

41:15.373 --> 41:17.943
This the part
where you tell me
you're not angry?

41:17.976 --> 41:21.378
Just disappointed?

41:21.411 --> 41:25.150
Pretty much.
Except for the bit
about not being angry.

41:28.653 --> 41:30.889
I'm-- I'm sorry, okay?

41:30.922 --> 41:33.891
It's not that easy.

41:33.925 --> 41:35.960
Well, what do you
want me to do?

41:35.994 --> 41:40.465
Reverse time and take it back?
(chuckles)
'Cause I could probably--

41:40.498 --> 41:43.168
A joke.
I don't think I could really--

41:43.201 --> 41:45.871
You know what?
Can-- Can we not do this now?

41:45.971 --> 41:47.972
I'm tired.

41:48.005 --> 41:49.740
Okay.

41:49.775 --> 41:52.443
Let's just forget
it ever happened.

41:58.016 --> 41:59.550
Forget.

42:16.967 --> 42:19.304
Ooh. Your feet are cold.

42:20.871 --> 42:23.307
Better warm me up.
Mmm.

42:24.775 --> 42:27.945
This is how every day
should always end

42:27.978 --> 42:30.916
and start and all the stuff
in the middle.

42:32.083 --> 42:35.253
So, uh, you're not mad?

42:35.286 --> 42:36.554
About what?

43:15.661 --> 43:17.795
Grr! Arrgh!
