WEBVTT

00:02.400 --> 00:04.118
The pilot comes on
with his announcements;

00:05.440 --> 00:07.192
"I'm going over this.
I'm going over that.

00:07.360 --> 00:09.828
I'm taking a left. I'm bringing it up.
I'm taking it down.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.275
I'm going right. I'm going this way.
Going that way."

00:12.440 --> 00:15.637
And we're back there,
"Yeah, that's all fine.

00:16.760 --> 00:20.992
Just do whatever the hell you gotta do.
I don't know what the hell is going on."

00:21.600 --> 00:23.989
Do I bother him? Do I go knocking
on the cockpit door?

00:24.160 --> 00:26.276
"I'm having the peanuts now.

00:27.840 --> 00:32.197
Just thought you might
like to know what we're doing."

00:36.640 --> 00:38.471
Thank you. Good night.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.560
-Jerry!
-Hey, hey.

00:42.720 --> 00:45.951
Sally Weaver. Susan Ross' roommate
from college?

00:46.120 --> 00:48.839
-Hello?
-Right. Oh, I'm sorry.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.072
-Oh, so you saw the show?
-Saw it? I loved it.

00:52.240 --> 00:54.470
And thank you for the free tickets.
You are so funny.

00:54.640 --> 00:56.198
-Oh, thanks.
-No, no, I mean it.

00:56.360 --> 00:58.715
-You're very funny.
-I believe you.

00:58.880 --> 01:00.472
Well, anyway, let me
show you Memphis.

01:00.640 --> 01:03.108
-I am taking you out to dinner.
-Oh, I'm sorry, I can't...

01:03.280 --> 01:05.874
-...I'm going straight to the airport.
-Oh, that's too bad.

01:06.040 --> 01:09.669
Susan thought we'd really get along.
I guess because we're both wacko.

01:09.840 --> 01:13.071
You know what, you have to
give this to them for me. Okay?

01:13.240 --> 01:14.832
Here, it's a wedding present.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.753
Oh, and Jerry, be careful with it,
okay? Be very careful.

01:20.120 --> 01:21.394
George, as you may be aware...

01:21.560 --> 01:24.916
...your mother and I are not
moving to Del Boca Vista, Florida.

01:25.080 --> 01:27.992
-I am aware.
-I was wondering, would it be okay...

01:28.160 --> 01:30.628
...if I turned your room
into a billiard parlor?

01:31.200 --> 01:32.394
A billiard parlor?

01:32.840 --> 01:36.196
Regulation table with a hi-fi,
maybe even a bar.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.874
Give it some real authenticity.

01:39.680 --> 01:43.355
-Well, that's-- Elaine.
-Oh, hi, Frank.

01:43.520 --> 01:48.150
-Sit down. Join us, please.
-Actually, I've gotta get to the thing.

01:48.320 --> 01:49.992
The thing's canceled. Sit down.

01:51.360 --> 01:52.998
Okay.

01:55.160 --> 01:58.709
So, Frank, did George
ever show you that photo?

01:59.040 --> 02:00.075
What photo?

02:00.240 --> 02:02.879
The photo I took in Tuscany
of the man in front of the sign...

02:03.040 --> 02:05.600
-...that said Costanza.
-There's a Costanza in Tuscany?

02:06.080 --> 02:08.435
Did he look like me?
Did you talk to him?

02:08.600 --> 02:11.353
I didn't talk to anyone. I was just
walking by and saw the sign.

02:11.520 --> 02:13.351
I thought George
might get a kick out of it.

02:13.640 --> 02:15.710
I gotta get that picture.

02:15.880 --> 02:18.553
-lt could be my cousin, Carlo.
-Who is that?

02:18.720 --> 02:22.315
When the Costanzas came here,
one brother stayed behind.

02:22.480 --> 02:24.755
I played with his son every day
until the age of 4...

02:24.920 --> 02:27.992
-...when we were separated.
-So you weren't born here?

02:28.160 --> 02:31.232
No. That's why
I could never be president.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.879
It always hurt me.

02:33.040 --> 02:36.669
That's why, even at an early age,
I had no interest in politics.

02:36.840 --> 02:39.798
I refuse to vote. They don't want me,
I don't want them!

02:39.960 --> 02:41.678
I don't know why
you're getting riled up.

02:41.840 --> 02:43.478
There's probably
a million Costanzas--

02:43.640 --> 02:45.358
Don't bring me down.

02:46.960 --> 02:50.236
-You have another copy of that photo?
-No, I don't.

02:50.400 --> 02:53.119
-But, well, the Maestro might.
-The Maestro? What Maestro?

02:53.280 --> 02:55.350
He's this guy
that I went to Tuscany with.

02:55.520 --> 02:59.149
He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't
feel comfortable calling him.

02:59.320 --> 03:00.548
Really? Why?

03:00.720 --> 03:03.518
Because he hasn't called me
since we got back.

03:03.680 --> 03:08.549
I spilled wine on this 8-by-10 photo of
one of his favorite ltalian opera stars.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.119
Who?

03:10.280 --> 03:13.750
-You know the Three Tenors?
-Yeah, Pavarotti, Domingo...

03:13.920 --> 03:16.309
-...and the other guy.
-The other guy.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.791
Can I take that box for you?

03:23.080 --> 03:25.514
Well, you better not.
I'm supposed to be careful with it.

03:25.680 --> 03:27.750
Then I'll have to put your bag
in the overhead.

03:27.920 --> 03:29.831
Oh, okay.

03:37.720 --> 03:39.278
There we go.

03:41.840 --> 03:44.149
-Oh, look at this.
-What?

03:44.320 --> 03:46.356
I bought a bottle
of barbecue sauce in Memphis.

03:46.520 --> 03:47.999
I think the stewardess broke it...

03:48.160 --> 03:51.152
...when she jammed it in the overhead
because of this stupid thing.

03:51.320 --> 03:53.038
Don't press the panic button.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.476
I'm sure that we can
still salvage some sauce.

03:55.640 --> 03:57.278
I don't care about the sauce.

03:57.440 --> 04:00.193
It came in this funny bottle
and there was a guy on the label...

04:00.360 --> 04:02.635
-...Iooked exactly like Charles Grodin.
-I see.

04:02.800 --> 04:05.598
No, you don't see. Because I'm going
on the show this week...

04:05.760 --> 04:07.591
...and this was gonna be
my bit on the show.

04:07.760 --> 04:09.591
-Why don't you do your material?
-I'm out.

04:11.360 --> 04:12.839
Boy, you better get to work.

04:13.440 --> 04:15.431
Thanks for the tip.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.873
-Hey, buddies.
-Hey. Hey, this is for you.

04:19.040 --> 04:21.110
It's from Susan's roommate, Sally.

04:21.279 --> 04:22.918
Oh, yeah, Sally called Susan.

04:23.080 --> 04:26.356
-Said you guys really hit it off.
-Nobody hit anything off.

04:26.520 --> 04:28.590
She just gave me the box.

04:31.520 --> 04:34.876
-What the hell are you doing?
-Well, I'm salvaging the sauce.

04:35.040 --> 04:36.234
What's the matter with you?

04:37.600 --> 04:39.158
Hey, hey, hey, come on. Come on.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.550
Jerry, why don't you do a bit
on Styrofoam?

04:41.720 --> 04:44.951
-Like what?
-You know, "What is all this stuff?

04:45.120 --> 04:47.315
Why do we need this stuff?

04:47.480 --> 04:51.189
And why do they make them
so small?"

04:53.040 --> 04:54.632
Where's the punch line?

04:55.200 --> 04:57.191
It's all attitude.

05:00.320 --> 05:02.151
This is certainly a crappy gift.

05:02.320 --> 05:03.673
A doormat?

05:03.840 --> 05:05.671
That's what she had me lug up
from Memphis?

05:05.840 --> 05:08.798
Pretty chintzy, huh?
Considering the money she makes.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.996
She's a big executive
for Federal Express.

05:11.320 --> 05:12.958
Federal Express?

05:13.120 --> 05:15.350
Is she out of her mind?
Why didn't she just ship it?

05:15.520 --> 05:19.035
Look, it's personalized.
"The Costanzas."

05:19.200 --> 05:21.919
No. No, forget it. I don't want it.
Let's just get rid of it.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.991
Maybe your father
would be interested in that.

05:24.160 --> 05:26.720
I doubt it.
You know what he's doing now?

05:26.880 --> 05:29.269
He's putting a pool table
in my old bedroom.

05:29.520 --> 05:33.718
Oh, yeah? Maybe I'll go out there and
knock a few balls around with him.

05:33.880 --> 05:36.997
You know, show him a thing or two.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.559
So, what's your game?
What do you like to play?

05:43.200 --> 05:45.111
-Eight ball.
-No, nothing doing.

05:45.280 --> 05:48.317
Let's you and me
play a game of straight pool.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.551
You like to gamble, Cosmo?

05:50.720 --> 05:54.508
Yeah, now and then.
You know how it is.

05:54.680 --> 05:57.433
-Five dollars a game, huh?
-I'll break.

05:57.600 --> 05:59.238
Okay.

06:01.000 --> 06:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:37.600 --> 06:40.160
That's it. That's it. Seven.

06:47.520 --> 06:49.238
What's--? What's all this?

06:49.600 --> 06:51.591
Oh, I'm just moving in
some more of my stuff.

06:51.760 --> 06:53.955
More of her stuff.

06:55.400 --> 06:57.118
Oh, I put up my doll collection.

06:59.040 --> 07:01.031
Oh, my God.

07:01.200 --> 07:04.431
-What is that?
-What? What is it?

07:05.240 --> 07:06.958
This doll looks like my mother.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.394
-George, it's a doll.
-I know it's a doll.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.630
But it looks like my mother.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.360
Oh, get out of here.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.991
-Seven, low.
-What's going on in here?

07:23.640 --> 07:27.758
Are you two still playing?
You've been up here three hours.

07:27.920 --> 07:30.639
-We haven't finished the first game.
-First game?

07:30.800 --> 07:34.031
Well, we're still learning
the subtleties of the table.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.555
He knows the Maestro.
He could have the picture.

07:36.720 --> 07:39.917
Oh, forget about it.
It's not your cousin.

07:40.080 --> 07:41.752
You don't know that!

07:43.280 --> 07:46.556
-We gonna go see him, huh?
-As soon as the game is over.

07:46.720 --> 07:50.235
-Oh, boy.
-Eleven, the corner pocket.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.952
What is this thing doing here?

07:57.120 --> 08:00.795
Oh, I used to love to sleep
with my dolls when I was a little girl.

08:00.960 --> 08:03.030
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

08:03.200 --> 08:05.760
-Why?
-I feel like I'm in bed with my mother.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.672
Stop it.

08:17.160 --> 08:20.470
Hey, Elaine, you have to buy this
new electric toothbrush I just got.

08:20.640 --> 08:22.073
-The Oro-Dent.
-Oh, yeah?

08:22.240 --> 08:25.232
Every time you use it, you feel like
you just came from the dentist.

08:25.400 --> 08:26.389
That's dynamite.

08:26.560 --> 08:29.028
Wanna come see me on
The Charles Grodin Show tomorrow?

08:29.200 --> 08:31.668
-Who else is on the show?
-One of the Three Tenors.

08:31.840 --> 08:36.231
-The Three Tenors? Which one?
-It's not Pavarotti, it's not Domingo--

08:36.400 --> 08:38.152
-The other guy?
-Yeah, the other guy.

08:38.919 --> 08:42.356
My God, I can't believe the other guy
is gonna be on the show.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.750
-Why?
-I ruined this autographed picture...

08:44.920 --> 08:47.593
...of him that belonged to the Maestro.
You think I could go?

08:47.760 --> 08:49.716
-I could get his autograph?
-Why not?

08:51.000 --> 08:53.275
The other guy.

08:56.080 --> 08:58.310
Hey, you look awful.

08:58.480 --> 09:00.471
I'm on no sleep, bro.

09:00.640 --> 09:04.633
-Problem in the bedroom?
-Susan has this doll collection.

09:04.800 --> 09:07.837
One of the dolls looks
exactly like my mother.

09:09.080 --> 09:11.753
She likes to sleep with it.

09:12.440 --> 09:15.034
You were in bed with your mother
last night?

09:15.560 --> 09:17.118
It felt like it.

09:18.240 --> 09:20.117
I tell you, this doll is pretty spooky.

09:20.960 --> 09:22.996
It's really freaking me out, man.

09:23.840 --> 09:26.718
And now I gotta go back out there
and pick up this doormat.

09:26.880 --> 09:29.440
-I thought you didn't want the doormat.
-I don't.

09:29.600 --> 09:32.034
Susan wants to have it out
when Sally comes tomorrow.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.079
-Sally?
-Yeah.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.912
Wait a minute.
She's coming to New York?

09:36.080 --> 09:38.594
-Yeah, Susan said you'd be excited.
-Excited?

09:38.760 --> 09:40.955
I'm gonna kill her.
She knew she was coming here...

09:41.120 --> 09:43.588
-...and she made me carry that box?
-Who is Sally?

09:43.760 --> 09:46.433
-Susan's college roommate.
-It's her fault that bottle broke...

09:46.600 --> 09:48.670
...that I was gonna give
to Charles Grodin.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.876
Call her and tell her
to bring you another one.

09:51.040 --> 09:53.679
-She'll be delighted to talk to you.
-Oh, I will. Don't worry.

09:53.840 --> 09:55.876
I'll have her bring up
a whole case of the stuff.

09:56.040 --> 09:59.032
It'll be really heavy. Let's see
if she likes sitting on a plane...

09:59.200 --> 10:02.670
-...with a big box on her lap.
-That sounds pretty juvenile.

10:02.960 --> 10:05.235
Hey, a dinosaur!

10:06.840 --> 10:08.671
His name was Carlo Costanza.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.637
We played together
every day until I was 4.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.109
If I could look at your photos,
maybe I can recognize him.

10:13.440 --> 10:16.000
Unfortunately, those photographs
are at home.

10:16.160 --> 10:19.311
If you bring them by, maybe we
could interest you in a game of pool.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.477
Frank here,
he's got his own billiard room.

10:21.640 --> 10:25.030
Yes, it's-- It's--
What do you call it, Kramer?

10:25.200 --> 10:27.589
-It's a billiard room.
-No.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.193
-The name?
-The billiard--

10:29.360 --> 10:31.999
Not billiard-- Not the billiards--
It was--

10:32.160 --> 10:33.513
Come on, already. Come on.

10:33.680 --> 10:35.398
-We call it the--
-The place to be.

10:35.560 --> 10:37.357
The place to be!
Yes, it's the place to be.

10:37.520 --> 10:39.238
Then I shall be there.

10:39.480 --> 10:43.792
Now, gentlemen, if you will excuse me,
I must prepare for the symphony.

10:43.960 --> 10:46.155
-Oh, yeah.
-Right.

10:51.680 --> 10:52.795
My pants.

10:52.960 --> 10:55.997
It's an old conductor's trick
I learned from Leonard Bernstein.

10:56.160 --> 10:58.628
-Really?
-You keep a perfect crease...

10:58.800 --> 11:01.189
...by not sitting in them
before the performance.

11:01.640 --> 11:03.278
That is....

11:03.640 --> 11:05.596
That's good thinking.

11:11.080 --> 11:12.354
You see?

11:12.720 --> 11:13.755
You see?

11:15.200 --> 11:16.872
It doesn't look exactly like her.

11:17.520 --> 11:19.954
Jerry, come on.
If my mother keeps shrinking...

11:20.120 --> 11:22.634
...this is exactly what she's
gonna look like in 10 years.

11:22.800 --> 11:24.836
-Why don't you just get rid of it?
-I tried.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.594
I almost threw it down the incinerator.
But I couldn't do it.

11:27.760 --> 11:30.558
The guilt was too overwhelming.
Susan's so attached to it.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.757
Well, where you going?
Don't take your dolly and go home.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.072
Hi, Elaine.

11:39.560 --> 11:42.154
-Did you see that?
-I'm just glad it's out of here.

11:43.120 --> 11:47.511
-What's that?
-Oh, it's a poster of the Three Tenors.

11:48.480 --> 11:50.471
-Yeah.
-It's Sally.

11:50.640 --> 11:52.312
Did you bring
the barbecue sauce?

11:52.480 --> 11:54.710
-A whole case.
-Excellent.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.389
Did you buy that electric toothbrush
I told you about?

11:57.560 --> 11:59.915
-No.
-How come? I told you, it's fantastic.

12:00.080 --> 12:02.799
-Yeah, I like mine.
-I've had yours.

12:02.960 --> 12:06.191
I'm telling you, this one is 10 times
better. Don't you believe me?

12:07.040 --> 12:08.792
-I don't want it.
-I don't understand.

12:08.960 --> 12:12.350
Why not get something that's better
if I'm telling you it's better?

12:12.520 --> 12:15.239
And it's not a little better.
It's much better.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.474
It doesn't matter to me.

12:19.520 --> 12:20.714
Come in.

12:21.520 --> 12:22.873
Well, here I am.

12:23.040 --> 12:25.429
-Oh, hi. Elaine, this is Sally.
-Hi.

12:25.600 --> 12:28.637
-How was your flight? Uncomfortable?
-The seat next to me was empty...

12:28.800 --> 12:30.995
...so there was no problem at all.

12:32.520 --> 12:35.910
Wait. This isn't the sauce
that I asked for.

12:36.080 --> 12:38.548
That's right.
It's a special gourmet sauce.

12:38.720 --> 12:39.914
The pride of Memphis.

12:40.080 --> 12:43.993
No, I wanted the one with the guy on it
that looks like Charles Grodin.

12:44.160 --> 12:46.674
This is much better.
And frankly, in Memphis...

12:46.840 --> 12:49.991
...we think that other sauce
is kind of a joke.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.720
I know it's a joke.
It's supposed to be a joke.

12:52.880 --> 12:55.553
Now I'm going on The Charles
Grodin Show with nothing.

12:55.720 --> 12:57.836
-Nothing!
-You could just do your material.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.072
-I don't have any material!
-He's got nothing!

13:08.640 --> 13:12.315
Georgie, don't eat with your hands.

13:14.320 --> 13:17.118
Why do you eat so fast?
You can't even taste it!

13:17.280 --> 13:19.475
Don't tell me how to eat.

13:20.320 --> 13:25.155
Still wearing that shirt?
You've had it for five years already.

13:25.320 --> 13:27.629
Why don't you buy a new shirt?

13:28.160 --> 13:30.515
Because I like this one.

13:33.440 --> 13:35.078
Come on, let's go.

13:35.240 --> 13:36.878
Let's go.

13:37.440 --> 13:38.953
Oh, hi, Deena.

13:46.360 --> 13:48.635
That man should really be
in a sanitarium.

13:49.760 --> 13:51.830
Oh, this is remarkable.
I'm lounging...

13:52.000 --> 13:54.070
...and yet my pants remain
perfectly creased.

13:54.240 --> 13:57.312
It's him. It's Carlo Costanza.

13:57.480 --> 14:00.278
-Come on. Are you sure?
-I'd know him anywhere.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.273
I've seen that man in Tuscany.
Eccentric fellow.

14:03.440 --> 14:06.432
Reputation of being
kind of a village idiot.

14:06.600 --> 14:07.919
I still say we're related.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.753
Oh, I love this piece.

14:10.920 --> 14:12.433
Come on, Frank, it's your shot.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.716
-I can't make anything.
-Because you don't know...

14:14.880 --> 14:17.030
-...how to follow through correct.
-Follow through?

14:17.200 --> 14:19.395
Here, let me show you.
Take hold of your stick.

14:19.560 --> 14:24.190
-Yeah, I got it.
-Get down. Bring it back slowly.

14:25.600 --> 14:28.478
It's a little unnatural,
but I think I'm getting the hang of it.

14:28.760 --> 14:30.796
Oh, my God.

14:31.800 --> 14:34.917
I'm such an idiot. I was gonna do
this whole bit on that bottle.

14:35.080 --> 14:38.709
-Now I got nothing to talk about.
-Have you ever considered writing...

14:38.880 --> 14:40.438
...new material?

14:40.960 --> 14:44.191
Maybe if I didn't have so many people
in my apartment all the time...

14:44.360 --> 14:45.918
...I'd be able
to get some work done.

14:46.280 --> 14:50.478
-Me? Are you talking about me?
-No, you're never here.

14:52.320 --> 14:55.517
-That doll was really freaky, wasn't it?
-Yeah, really.

14:55.680 --> 14:57.830
Hey, maybe I could talk about that
on the show.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.992
-What?
-Show the doll. Show a picture...

15:00.160 --> 15:03.948
...of George's mother. It's pretty funny.
I'm gonna call him.

15:06.520 --> 15:08.397
-Hello?
-Hello, Susan, it's Jerry.

15:08.560 --> 15:09.834
Hi, Jerry, it's Sally.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.074
Is George there?

15:12.240 --> 15:14.390
-No, but he should be home soon.
-This is important.

15:14.560 --> 15:17.518
Tell him to meet me at the TV studio
with a picture of his mother...

15:17.680 --> 15:20.797
-...and that doll that looks like her.
-ls this for your comedy routine?

15:20.960 --> 15:23.838
-Yes.
-Don't worry, I'm on the case.

15:28.800 --> 15:31.712
I think I'll get some air.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.154
Yeah.

15:35.720 --> 15:37.631
This is no good.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.073
Hey, the baton.

15:41.760 --> 15:46.629
Yeah, I've got a hunch, fat man,
I can't miss. Thirteen, in the side.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.474
Giddyup.

15:48.640 --> 15:50.471
Six, in the corner.

15:52.440 --> 15:53.998
This table's mine.

16:01.560 --> 16:02.675
You know where it's going.

16:09.720 --> 16:10.869
-Hey.
-Hey.

16:11.040 --> 16:12.871
-ls George here?
-Not yet.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.553
The other guy.

16:16.240 --> 16:17.832
It's...

16:19.160 --> 16:22.072
...you. It's really you.

16:23.560 --> 16:26.472
I'm such a huge fan of yours.

16:26.960 --> 16:29.235
Would you mind
signing this poster for me?

16:29.400 --> 16:31.960
-My pleasure.
-Oh, thank you so much.

16:32.120 --> 16:33.758
Here you go.

16:34.840 --> 16:39.709
Thank you so much, Mr. Camaro.

16:41.480 --> 16:43.596
Mr. Casea.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.279
Well, whatever.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.319
I'm gonna take this to the Maestro.

16:48.480 --> 16:50.550
He's playing at
the Queens Convalescent Center.

16:50.720 --> 16:54.315
Yeah, that's a hell of a gig.
Hey, look, I got something for you.

16:54.480 --> 16:55.595
The Oro-Dent.

16:57.760 --> 16:58.795
Thank you.

17:00.680 --> 17:03.638
What--? Why does a toothbrush
come in such a big box?

17:03.800 --> 17:06.394
Well, it's a delicate mechanism,
it needs a lot of packing.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.391
How am I supposed to carry
this thing?

17:12.160 --> 17:15.435
-What are you doing?
-Well, I wanna sit down.

17:15.760 --> 17:18.194
-So?
-It's a trick I just learned from Kramer.

17:18.359 --> 17:20.635
Keeps a crease in the pants.

17:33.560 --> 17:37.792
Madam, you have been
an extremely gracious hostess.

17:39.520 --> 17:41.112
Thank you, Maestro.

17:41.400 --> 17:44.392
-Here, take a look at this.
-Yeah, what is it?

17:44.560 --> 17:47.120
It's Carlo. I found him.

17:47.280 --> 17:49.919
You've been cooped up
in this room too long.

17:50.080 --> 17:53.356
You never support me! Let's see
what George says about this.

17:53.520 --> 17:55.238
Where are my pants?

17:57.360 --> 17:59.157
Oh, beautiful.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.869
-Hey there, Mr. Hairy Legs.
-Where's George?

18:06.040 --> 18:09.112
Don't worry, I brought your doll.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.391
No, that's the wrong doll.

18:12.560 --> 18:15.870
Jerry, I saw the doll you were
talking about. Not funny.

18:16.040 --> 18:19.476
This doll is much funnier. Look,
it has a bow tie and a cute little hat.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.392
I think it's a riot.

18:22.280 --> 18:23.793
This is a nightmare.

18:24.480 --> 18:27.836
Well, I'll be watching.
Don't screw up.

18:30.800 --> 18:32.472
Too much sauce.

18:35.680 --> 18:39.309
-My pants!
-Mr. Seinfeld, you're on.

19:08.840 --> 19:11.308
Elaine. What a surprise.

19:11.480 --> 19:15.598
I know you're very busy, but I just
wanted to come by and give you this.

19:15.760 --> 19:18.957
Oh, Oro-Dent, that electric toothbrush.
I've heard so much about it.

19:19.120 --> 19:22.396
No, no, no. Not the toothbrush.
This.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.870
What a sweet gesture.
An autographed poster...

19:34.040 --> 19:36.873
...of my favorite tenor
with those two other guys.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.797
Oh, Elaine, this is magnifico.

19:41.120 --> 19:43.588
I just felt so bad
about what happened in Tuscany--

19:43.760 --> 19:45.876
Maestro, you're on.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.393
Elaine, wait for me
after the concert.

19:49.560 --> 19:52.711
-We'll celebrate.
-Oh, okay.

20:28.440 --> 20:31.352
I wanna know why you took
my doll out of the house.

20:31.520 --> 20:33.590
I just wanted a second opinion.

20:38.880 --> 20:41.599
Take a look at this. Does that
look like my flesh and blood?

20:41.760 --> 20:44.797
-Of course, your mother--
-Oh, stop bothering everybody...

20:44.960 --> 20:47.349
...with that picture. It's ridiculous.

20:47.520 --> 20:51.832
Ridiculous? I'll show you ridiculous!
Come here!

20:52.000 --> 20:54.389
No, Mr. Costanza-- No!

20:55.160 --> 20:56.309
There.

20:56.480 --> 20:59.313
Now what have you got
to say for yourself?

21:00.000 --> 21:01.592
I told you it looked like her.

21:15.520 --> 21:18.796
Carlo. It's me, Frank.

21:26.720 --> 21:29.837
I'm your cousin, Frank.
Aren't you Carlo?

21:30.000 --> 21:32.594
Carlo? No.

21:35.760 --> 21:37.478
What do you know?

21:37.880 --> 21:40.872
All right. I guess I was wrong.
