WEBVTT

00:00.067 --> 00:02.334
<i> We're live on the scene of a</i>
<i> high-speed police pursuit of an</i>

00:02.336 --> 00:06.205
<i> armored car stolen earlier</i>
<i> today from the federal reserve</i>
<i> in Denver.</i>

00:06.207 --> 00:12.277
<i> It is believed the thieves also</i>
<i> have a hostage.</i>

00:32.400 --> 00:36.535
<i> Wait. What's this?</i>

00:36.537 --> 00:41.306
<i> Yes. It looks like we have</i>
<i> another alien sighting.</i>

00:53.721 --> 00:55.721
<i> we don't know where these</i>

00:55.723 --> 00:57.056
<i> strange creatures come from,</i>

00:57.058 --> 00:59.258
<i> but they seem to</i>
<i> be here to</i> help.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.360
The omnitrix wasted on

01:01.362 --> 01:03.328
pointless heroics.

01:03.330 --> 01:04.696
Shall I dispatch more drones

01:04.698 --> 01:06.165
to retrieve it?

01:06.167 --> 01:09.301
No.

01:13.207 --> 01:16.175
I will see to this task myself.

02:23.677 --> 02:24.676
Another nightmare, Ben?

02:24.678 --> 02:26.345
It was that weird alien from

02:26.347 --> 02:29.781
my vision, only bigger, uglier,

02:29.783 --> 02:30.816
and scarier.

02:30.818 --> 02:31.817
Sure you weren't just

02:31.819 --> 02:33.385
looking in a mirror?

02:33.387 --> 02:35.420
It was just a bad dream, son.

02:35.422 --> 02:37.456
We can talk about
it in the morning.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.458
It seemed so real.

02:39.460 --> 02:40.759
He looked right at me and said,

02:40.761 --> 02:45.564
"I'm coming for you now."

02:45.566 --> 02:46.431
Change of plan.

02:46.433 --> 02:48.333
We're hitting
the road right now.

02:48.335 --> 02:51.537
Grandpa, it's 3:00
in the morning.

02:51.539 --> 02:55.174
Best way to beat the traffic.

03:01.815 --> 03:04.316
Uh, grandpa, what's with
the lead foot?

03:04.318 --> 03:07.486
I want to make Mount
Rushmore by nightfall.

03:07.488 --> 03:09.788
I'm so bored.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.356
Let me play a game.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.691
I would, but I think this

03:12.693 --> 03:13.759
will be a good lesson for you

03:13.761 --> 03:19.298
to learn how to entertain
Yourself.

03:21.669 --> 03:24.336
The omnitrix has been
activated.

03:24.338 --> 03:28.740
Pinpoint its location.

03:28.976 --> 03:31.710
I have you now.

03:34.248 --> 03:36.248
Hey! What gives?

03:36.250 --> 03:37.916
Sorry. You are a loser and

03:37.918 --> 03:40.419
always will be.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.688
Aah! Ben!

03:42.690 --> 03:44.623
Get out of my computer.

03:44.625 --> 03:47.226
<i> What?</i>
<i> I'm just entertaining myself.</i>

03:47.228 --> 03:48.794
This is my private property,

03:48.796 --> 03:51.730
And you're getting your cooties
all over it.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.466
Ooh! What's this?

03:54.468 --> 03:55.767
A diary!

03:55.769 --> 03:59.438
"dear diary, my cousin Ben is

03:59.440 --> 04:00.005
Such a"-

04:00.007 --> 04:01.273
Doofus, knock it off!

04:01.275 --> 04:02.407
Ben, now is not the time to

04:02.409 --> 04:05.410
go alien.
Do you understand?

04:05.412 --> 04:06.812
I was just fooling around.

04:06.814 --> 04:07.980
We can't afford to attract

04:07.982 --> 04:09.448
attention right now.

04:09.450 --> 04:10.616
<i> What kind of attention could</i>

04:10.618 --> 04:14.319
<i> I attract in here?</i>

04:14.321 --> 04:17.022
Never mind.

04:21.028 --> 04:23.662
We have lost
the omnitrix signal.

04:23.664 --> 04:24.863
No matter.

04:24.865 --> 04:28.567
I've narrowed down its location.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.371
I know just how to draw this

04:32.373 --> 04:35.007
Earthling out.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.073
What's going on over there?

05:08.075 --> 05:09.308
I'm sure the local

05:09.310 --> 05:10.642
authorities have the situation

05:10.644 --> 05:12.577
well in hand.

05:25.893 --> 05:29.728
Aah!

05:31.031 --> 05:33.098
Looks like it's hero time!

05:33.100 --> 05:34.800
Ben, I don't think that's

05:34.802 --> 05:35.634
the best ide-

05:35.636 --> 05:36.735
Time to turn up the

05:36.737 --> 05:41.673
heatblast on these guys.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.922
What's going on?

05:56.924 --> 06:02.394
Aah, aah!

06:02.396 --> 06:03.929
Unh!

06:05.833 --> 06:07.666
Hey. Why don't you pick on

06:07.668 --> 06:12.504
someone with real firepower?

06:13.440 --> 06:14.039
Oh, man.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.041
I didn't mean all at once.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.409
Why do I get the feeling you

06:17.411 --> 06:20.045
were expecting me?

06:40.634 --> 06:42.734
Unh!

06:57.050 --> 06:59.484
Huh?

07:09.863 --> 07:10.929
You!

07:10.931 --> 07:13.565
You're the alien
from my visions.

07:13.567 --> 07:16.034
At last we meet, the being

07:16.036 --> 07:20.105
that has caused
me so much trouble.

07:24.011 --> 07:24.976
Who are you?

07:24.978 --> 07:27.813
I am vilgax, and I have come

07:27.815 --> 07:29.714
for the omnitrix.

07:29.716 --> 07:31.750
And, uh, I'm guessing you're

07:31.752 --> 07:35.520
not with the good guys.

07:35.522 --> 07:38.790
Aah!

07:48.735 --> 07:52.103
Unh!

08:02.516 --> 08:06.017
Ok. This guy's really tough.

08:11.158 --> 08:15.093
I've got to slow him down.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.262
Unh!

08:31.745 --> 08:35.046
No! It can't be.

08:36.283 --> 08:37.782
Not so tough when you can't

08:37.784 --> 08:41.119
move, are you?

08:41.121 --> 08:43.522
Ben, grandpa says
to get in now!

08:43.524 --> 08:44.789
What are you talking about?

08:44.791 --> 08:48.693
I'm just about to kick
alien butt!

08:50.030 --> 08:53.098
Benjamin, get in!

08:55.969 --> 08:57.302
Believe when I say, you do

08:57.304 --> 09:01.072
not want to pick a fight
with Vilgax.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.074
Uh, how do you know his name

09:03.076 --> 09:04.809
is vilgax?

09:04.811 --> 09:06.144
Grandpa, what aren't you

09:06.146 --> 09:09.981
telling us?

09:12.653 --> 09:15.186
Unh!

09:15.188 --> 09:18.657
Two robot goons closing
in fast!

09:18.659 --> 09:20.759
Hold on!

09:27.668 --> 09:30.001
We can't keep this up
forever!

09:30.003 --> 09:31.136
Things are gonna get a whole

09:31.138 --> 09:36.174
lot worse if we don't get to
Mount Rushmore.

09:36.176 --> 09:36.975
Unh!

09:36.977 --> 09:39.911
Why? What's at mount rushmore?

09:39.913 --> 09:41.279
Gwen, this is not the time

09:41.281 --> 09:43.682
to explain.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.617
You're gonna have to trust me.

09:45.619 --> 09:46.851
Well I'm not going down

09:46.853 --> 09:49.688
without a fight.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.890
Yes!

09:51.892 --> 09:54.326
Ben, wait!

10:16.650 --> 10:18.783
Float like a butterfly but

10:18.785 --> 10:22.287
sting like a stinkfly!

10:22.289 --> 10:25.824
Unh!

10:25.826 --> 10:29.260
Give me the omnitrix.

10:38.639 --> 10:42.674
Who is this guy?

10:44.678 --> 10:46.111
Where are we going?

10:46.113 --> 10:47.245
We have to help Ben!

10:47.247 --> 10:48.647
We will, but first, we'll

10:48.649 --> 10:50.081
need to get some special help.

10:50.083 --> 10:53.985
Let me guess-at
Mount Rushmore?

10:53.987 --> 10:56.421
Grandpa, you're really freaking

10:56.423 --> 10:59.057
me out.

11:02.362 --> 11:05.830
Aah!

11:07.401 --> 11:11.736
I grow tired of this.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.707
Hey! How'd you do that?

11:15.709 --> 11:16.908
A child?

11:16.910 --> 11:19.411
The omnitrix is in the hands of

11:19.413 --> 11:23.048
a mere child?!

11:23.050 --> 11:26.718
Unh!

11:27.020 --> 11:28.286
It appears the omnitrix has

11:28.288 --> 11:32.824
already merged
with your own Dna.

11:34.428 --> 11:37.696
Unh! I, uh,
don't suppose that means

11:37.698 --> 11:40.131
you're gonna let me go, does it?

11:40.133 --> 11:42.467
Hardly.

11:45.806 --> 11:48.707
Yaah!

11:58.318 --> 12:00.251
I don't think tourists are

12:00.253 --> 12:01.920
allowed on this road.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.488
We're not tourists.

12:03.490 --> 12:06.458
We're tenants.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.862
Ohh!

12:40.293 --> 12:41.760
That's it!

12:41.762 --> 12:42.961
I am not taking another step

12:42.963 --> 12:45.363
until you tell me
what's going on!

12:45.365 --> 12:46.931
Why aren't we helping Ben, what

12:46.933 --> 12:48.233
IS this place, and now do you

12:48.235 --> 12:49.534
know about that alien guy who's

12:49.536 --> 12:50.535
After Ben?

12:50.537 --> 12:51.803
Well, it's kind of

12:51.805 --> 12:53.538
complicated, but let's just

12:53.540 --> 12:55.306
say...

12:55.308 --> 12:56.975
I wasn't exactly your normal

12:56.977 --> 13:01.446
plumber before I retired.

13:06.186 --> 13:07.552
A child.

13:07.554 --> 13:10.121
I should have suspected as much.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.557
The omnitrix being used as

13:12.559 --> 13:14.092
play toy.

13:14.094 --> 13:18.029
Hey! I've saved a lot
of people by going hero.

13:18.031 --> 13:20.131
You hold the key to a power

13:20.133 --> 13:24.068
struggle so ancient, so vast it

13:24.070 --> 13:28.106
is beyond your feeble
comprehension.

13:28.108 --> 13:30.975
Picture an entire army, each in

13:30.977 --> 13:34.846
command of an omnitrix, and all

13:34.848 --> 13:38.483
at my command.

13:39.486 --> 13:43.822
I will be invincible.

13:43.824 --> 13:47.325
I will rule the universe, and

13:47.327 --> 13:49.494
the only thing standing between

13:49.496 --> 13:55.200
me and my destiny is you.

13:56.903 --> 13:58.970
This weapon is keyed into

13:58.972 --> 14:00.572
Vilgax's biosignature.

14:00.574 --> 14:01.973
Hopefully, it will take him

14:01.975 --> 14:04.108
down for good this time.

14:04.110 --> 14:05.043
This time?

14:05.045 --> 14:06.277
There's a small red button

14:06.279 --> 14:07.879
under that cabinet.

14:07.881 --> 14:10.882
Press it.

14:10.884 --> 14:11.382
Hey!

14:11.384 --> 14:12.984
Gps-assisted tracking system.

14:12.986 --> 14:15.386
It's locked on
the watch's signal.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.288
You navigate.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.591
Prepare for takeoff.

14:19.593 --> 14:21.359
Once we're in orbit, I will

14:21.361 --> 14:23.027
finally have the pleasure of

14:23.029 --> 14:25.396
destroying this miserable

14:25.398 --> 14:29.300
planet once and for all.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.309
There's the spaceship.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.411
We have to get aboard.

14:40.413 --> 14:45.116
Get aboard? How?

14:56.529 --> 14:59.230
Aah!

15:15.682 --> 15:17.315
Warning. Hull breach.

15:17.317 --> 15:18.549
Power surge.

15:18.551 --> 15:21.352
Claws off my grandson,
Vilgax.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.087
Grandpa?

15:23.089 --> 15:26.057
Tennyson.

15:30.363 --> 15:33.331
Grandpa, you know this guy?

15:33.333 --> 15:36.434
It's a long story.

15:39.172 --> 15:40.538
Unh!

15:40.540 --> 15:42.240
Hey!

15:42.242 --> 15:45.343
What's going-unh!

15:45.345 --> 15:51.282
The power surge must have
affected the watch.

15:51.584 --> 15:54.052
errgh!

16:00.126 --> 16:01.326
Unh!

16:01.328 --> 16:03.428
Look out!

16:07.600 --> 16:10.134
Oh, man!

16:13.306 --> 16:15.373
A little alien know-how, and

16:15.375 --> 16:18.576
the coast is toast.

16:23.750 --> 16:24.649
Ohh!

16:24.651 --> 16:29.020
Try picking on someone your
own size.

16:42.369 --> 16:46.270
I've got to get this ship
under control.

16:46.272 --> 16:49.340
He can fly a spaceship?

16:49.342 --> 16:50.742
At this point, nothing

16:50.744 --> 16:53.444
surprises me.

16:57.650 --> 17:01.386
Aah!

17:01.388 --> 17:03.588
Unh!

17:03.590 --> 17:06.157
Grandpa!

17:06.159 --> 17:09.093
Your weapon won't help,
Teyson.

17:09.095 --> 17:10.428
As you can see, I'm much

17:10.430 --> 17:16.801
stronger than in our last
encounter.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.804
Nooo!

17:19.806 --> 17:21.339
Unh!

17:21.341 --> 17:23.241
Ben!

17:43.329 --> 17:44.295
Oh.

17:44.297 --> 17:48.066
Sometimes, I hate this watch.

17:53.506 --> 17:56.774
We've got to get out of here!

17:59.345 --> 18:00.745
Ugh.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.448
Cant...Breathe.

18:03.450 --> 18:07.085
Need water.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.361
You are a slippery little

18:17.363 --> 18:23.301
fish, child, but no longer.

18:23.303 --> 18:24.802
I can still give you a run

18:24.804 --> 18:27.171
for your money.

18:27.173 --> 18:28.406
You can't hide from me

18:28.408 --> 18:31.242
forever, boy.

18:31.244 --> 18:33.578
Wasn't planning on it.

18:33.580 --> 18:36.147
Peek-a-boo.

18:39.185 --> 18:40.351
Ohh!

18:40.353 --> 18:42.220
I'm gonna feel that tomorrow.

18:42.222 --> 18:47.358
For you, there is no
tomorrow.

18:57.904 --> 19:02.173
You can't escape me!

19:02.709 --> 19:04.642
Hyah!

19:07.914 --> 19:10.815
Special delivery!

19:15.622 --> 19:16.621
Oh, man.

19:16.623 --> 19:19.657
Guess I should have
seen that coming.

19:19.659 --> 19:22.360
Unh!

19:22.362 --> 19:24.295
Ohh!

19:30.370 --> 19:31.802
Yes!

19:31.804 --> 19:35.907
Sometimes, I love this watch.

19:52.458 --> 19:54.292
Better hang on to something.

19:54.294 --> 19:57.395
This may get a little bumpy.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.397
Aah!

20:03.303 --> 20:05.269
Aah!

20:05.271 --> 20:08.372
Don't switch on me now.

20:09.209 --> 20:11.709
Oh, no!

20:17.450 --> 20:21.352
You all right, gwen?

20:21.354 --> 20:23.521
Oh. At times like this,
going back

20:23.523 --> 20:26.390
TO school doesn't seem so bad.

20:26.759 --> 20:30.962
Ben?!

20:34.300 --> 20:36.300
Grandpa?

20:36.302 --> 20:38.869
Gwen?

20:41.007 --> 20:43.374
No!

20:49.916 --> 20:55.853
It's your
choice. You or them.

21:01.995 --> 21:04.829
How noble.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.302
Vilgax, no.

21:11.304 --> 21:13.437
Don't go back in there.

21:18.678 --> 21:21.445
Foolish earthling, why would

21:21.447 --> 21:23.648
I- the autodestruct launch

21:23.650 --> 21:28.519
sequence has been initiated!

21:28.655 --> 21:30.955
Tennyson!

21:30.957 --> 21:34.959
You are the thorn in my side.

21:35.695 --> 21:38.996
Guess it runs in the family.

21:38.998 --> 21:42.767
<i> Commencing self-destruct</i>
<i> Launch.</i>

21:42.769 --> 21:46.637
Nooooo!

22:08.695 --> 22:09.927
Not bad for a doofus.

22:09.929 --> 22:13.764
Grandpa, we need to talk.
