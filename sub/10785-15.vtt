WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.542
PREVIOUSLY ON DAWSON'S CREEK...

00:03.542 --> 00:04.583
WHERE IS YOUR DAD, JACK?

00:04.583 --> 00:05.875
TRUTH IS
HE'S UP IN PROVIDENCE

00:05.875 --> 00:06.875
BECAUSE HE LEFT US.

00:06.875 --> 00:08.417
PLEASE READ US
YOUR POEM.

00:08.417 --> 00:09.583
I'D REALLY RATHER NOT.

00:09.583 --> 00:11.375
PETERSON MAKES HIM READ
HIS POEM IN CLASS.

00:11.375 --> 00:12.750
HE STARTS CRYING.

00:12.750 --> 00:14.333
THE POEM?
IT'S ABOUT A GUY.

00:14.333 --> 00:16.875
WHAT PART OF YOU IS THAT GETS
OFF ON TORTURING YOUR STUDENTS?

00:16.875 --> 00:18.500
TRYING TO TEACH
PEOPLE LIKE YOU

00:18.500 --> 00:21.208
IS LIKE SPITTING IN
THE FACE OF THE ENTIRE
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM.

00:21.208 --> 00:22.208
DID YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA WHAT I
WENT THROUGH?

00:22.208 --> 00:24.583
HOW MUCH I NEEDED
YOUR SUPPORT?

00:24.583 --> 00:26.583
PACEY, I CAN'T SUPPORT
EVERYTHING YOU DO.

00:26.583 --> 00:27.625
ARE YOU GAY?

00:27.625 --> 00:29.750
NO.

00:29.750 --> 00:30.333
I'M NOT GAY.

00:32.667 --> 00:34.792
I'M STARTING
A NEW COMPANY

00:34.792 --> 00:36.708
AND THE FISH
WILL COME WITH ME.

00:36.708 --> 00:40.417
CALL ME SENTIMENTAL.

00:40.417 --> 00:42.708
THE FISH, THEY'RE
COMING WITH ME.

00:42.708 --> 00:43.959
DAWSON LEERY,

00:43.959 --> 00:46.458
PERSONAL HOMEWORK
COURIER HAS ARRIVED.

00:47.917 --> 00:49.125
APPARENTLY JUST IN TIME

00:49.125 --> 00:50.375
FOR A PRIVATE SCREENING
AT HIS HOME THEATER.

00:50.375 --> 00:53.583
DAWSON, WHEN MY SUSPENSION
IS OVER TOMORROW,

00:53.583 --> 00:55.166
I'LL GO BACK HOME.
BUT UNTIL THEN,

00:55.166 --> 00:56.917
I'M WILLING TO RISK YOU
GETTING SICK OF ME

00:56.917 --> 00:58.333
FOR INVADING
YOUR PERSONAL DOMAIN.

00:58.333 --> 01:00.208
BECAUSE HIDING OUT HERE
AND ALIENATING YOU

01:00.208 --> 01:02.041
BEATS THE HELL OUT OF
TORTURE AND DEATH

01:02.041 --> 01:03.542
AT THE HANDS OF MY FATHER
BACK AT HOME.

01:03.542 --> 01:04.625
WELL, I'M GLAD TO HELP.

01:04.625 --> 01:06.458
I'M JUST SAYING
I WILL BE HAPPY

01:06.458 --> 01:10.542
ONCE MY ROOM RETURNS
TO ITS ORIGINAL OWNER.

01:10.542 --> 01:11.959
AND ODOR.

01:11.959 --> 01:13.792
JERRY MAGUIRE
AGAIN, HUH?

01:13.792 --> 01:16.041
YEAH. I'M RUNNING IT
ON A CONTINUOUS LOOP.

01:16.041 --> 01:19.542
IT SPEAKS TO MY CURRENT
SITUATION AS A RENEGADE
MORAL CRUSADER.

01:19.542 --> 01:20.792
TV: WHO'S COMING
WITH ME?

01:20.792 --> 01:24.625
SO, WHAT'S NEW IN THE LAND
OF HIGHER EDUCATION?

01:24.625 --> 01:26.458
PRETTY MUCH
THE SAME OLD.

01:26.458 --> 01:29.458
PLUS OR MINUS A FEW
SEXUAL IDENTITY CRISES.

01:29.458 --> 01:30.083
HOW IS JACK?

01:30.083 --> 01:32.750
WELL, HE SEEMS OK.

01:32.750 --> 01:34.250
HE'S KINDA KEEPING
A LOW PROFILE.

01:34.250 --> 01:34.834
AND JOEY?

01:34.834 --> 01:37.208
SHE'S FINE.

01:37.208 --> 01:39.917
AND, UH, ANDIE?

01:39.917 --> 01:42.000
ANDIE...LAST I HEARD

01:42.000 --> 01:43.417
HAD, UH, RUN OFF TO BALI

01:43.417 --> 01:44.500
WITH A BRAZILIAN
SOAP STAR NAMED DIEGO.

01:44.500 --> 01:45.750
I HEAR SHE'S VERY
HAPPY, THOUGH.

01:45.750 --> 01:46.792
AND TAN.

01:46.792 --> 01:49.000
[SIGHS]

01:49.000 --> 01:51.792
WOULD YOU JUST
CALL HER, YOU IDIOT?

01:51.792 --> 01:53.417
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
LET A WEEK GO BY

01:53.417 --> 01:54.750
WITHOUT EVEN
TALKING TO HER.

01:54.750 --> 01:55.792
DAWSON, IT'S NOT
THAT EASY, OK?

01:55.792 --> 01:57.250
ANDIE THINKS
I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR DRAGGING

01:57.250 --> 02:00.083
ANOTHER McPHEE SCANDAL
THROUGH THE SCHOOL

02:00.083 --> 02:00.834
AND I THINK SHE
WAS BEING SHORT-SIGHTED,

02:00.834 --> 02:02.959
SELFISH, AND INSENSITIVE.

02:02.959 --> 02:05.208
SO FOR RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE AT AN IMPASSE.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.708
NO, LAST WEEK YOU
WERE AT AN IMPASSE.

02:06.708 --> 02:08.583
NOW, YOU'RE JUST
IN AVOIDANCE.

02:10.542 --> 02:14.166
SHE'S HURTING, AND YOU
CARE ABOUT HER, PACEY.

02:14.166 --> 02:15.542
JUST APOLOGIZE, MAN.

02:15.542 --> 02:17.708
SWALLOW YOUR PRIDE,
GET YOUR GIRLFRIEND
BACK.

02:17.708 --> 02:19.959
I DON'T WANT TO APOLOGIZE
TO HER, DAWSON.

02:19.959 --> 02:23.166
I STOOD UP FOR SOMETHING THAT
I BELIEVE IN. I WAS RIGHT.

02:23.166 --> 02:24.834
I MEAN, LOOK AT MY MAN
JERRY HERE.

02:24.834 --> 02:26.291
HIS MISSION STATEMENT.
HE TOOK A STAND.

02:26.291 --> 02:30.375
TV: WE'LL SEE YOU
ALL AGAIN.

02:30.375 --> 02:31.959
AND HE LOST EVERYTHING.

02:31.959 --> 02:33.708
AND HE HAD TO BEG,
GROVEL, AND CRAWL
TO GET IT ALL BACK.

02:33.708 --> 02:36.583
AND HE WAS NOT
SLEEPING ON HIS
FRIEND'S FLOOR.

02:36.583 --> 02:38.125
YOU SAID I COULD
HAVE THE BED TONIGHT.

02:38.125 --> 02:38.834
I DON'T THINK SO.

02:38.834 --> 02:40.125
JOEY GETS THE BED.

02:40.125 --> 02:43.667
HA HA. DON'T GO THERE.

03:39.708 --> 03:40.250
OK. SEE YOU LATER.
OK.

03:40.250 --> 03:41.500
BYE.
BYE.

03:43.125 --> 03:46.583
LOVE BLOOMS IN CAPESIDE.

03:46.583 --> 03:48.250
GOD, I FEEL SO SILLY.

03:48.250 --> 03:50.834
IT'S LIKE I'VE GOT THIS
STUPID JUNIOR HIGH CRUSH.

03:50.834 --> 03:52.875
IT'S GREAT. IT'S
A BEAUTIFUL THING.

03:52.875 --> 03:53.917
I'M VERY HAPPY FOR YOU.

03:53.917 --> 03:55.500
HE SEEMS LIKE A REALLY
NICE GUY, TOO.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.625
HE IS.

03:56.625 --> 03:58.667
HE'S VERY COOL.
GREAT.

03:58.667 --> 04:00.834
ACTUALLY, UM, YOU FEEL
LIKE JOINING US?

04:00.834 --> 04:03.458
WE'RE PLANNING A LITTLE
EVENING EXCURSION TONIGHT.

04:03.458 --> 04:04.708
A BIBLE PARTY?

04:04.708 --> 04:06.041
NOT EXACTLY.

04:09.834 --> 04:11.458
HOW DEEP DOES
THIS THING GO?

04:11.458 --> 04:13.959
I CAN'T FIND MY ECON BOOK.

04:15.708 --> 04:17.959
OOH. NICE PURSE,
McPHEE.

04:17.959 --> 04:21.416
YEAH, LET ME KNOW IF
YOU WANT TO BORROW IT
SOMETIME, MORGAN.

04:21.416 --> 04:22.750
WHAT A JERK.

04:22.750 --> 04:23.875
WHATEVER.

04:23.875 --> 04:25.625
IT WOULD BE NICE
IF THE RUNNING COMMENTARY

04:25.625 --> 04:26.750
WOULD FINALLY COME
TO A STOP, THAT'S ALL.

04:26.750 --> 04:28.875
AND GIVE UP MY ROLE
AS CAPESIDE'S

04:28.875 --> 04:30.708
MOST TALKED ABOUT
NON-HOMOSEXUAL?

04:30.708 --> 04:32.250
LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

04:32.250 --> 04:33.417
JACK, YOU'RE NOT GAY.

04:33.417 --> 04:36.458
AND WHAT IS THE JOY IN
TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING

04:36.458 --> 04:38.750
THAT'S ALREADY BEEN REFUTED?

04:38.750 --> 04:40.583
WELL, WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE.

04:40.583 --> 04:45.333
I SAY WE MAKE LOVE RIGHT
ON THE STUDENT GREEN.

04:45.333 --> 04:48.166
WAIT. EVEN BETTER.
WE CAN "IN" ME.

04:48.166 --> 04:49.917
WE CAN HAVE A GOING
INTO THE CLOSET PARTY.

04:49.917 --> 04:50.959
AND EVERYBODY
CAN COME DRESSED UP

04:50.959 --> 04:53.041
AS THEIR FAVORITE
STRAIGHT PERSON.

04:54.291 --> 04:57.542
GET TO CLASS,
STRAIGHT BOY.

04:57.542 --> 04:59.083
OH, NO. THAT'S, UH,

04:59.083 --> 05:00.583
[DEEP VOICE]
THAT'S BUBBA TO YOU.

05:10.458 --> 05:10.959
I KNOW THAT LOOK.

05:10.959 --> 05:12.750
UH, YEAH, UM,

05:12.750 --> 05:17.250
IT'S THE UNIVERSAL LOOK
FOR "DON'T ASK," OK?

05:17.250 --> 05:18.625
OK.

05:18.625 --> 05:22.333
UM, TONIGHT JEN
HAS CONVINCED ME
TO TAG ALONG

05:22.333 --> 05:24.291
TO THIS CLUB
THAT TY LIKES.
DO YOU WANT TO COME?

05:24.291 --> 05:25.542
I CAN'T.

05:25.542 --> 05:26.625
OK.

05:26.625 --> 05:28.333
I'M SORRY, UM...

05:28.333 --> 05:29.500
THANK YOU FOR ASKING.

05:29.500 --> 05:32.375
IT'S JUST, UM, JACK AND I
HAVE PLANS TO STUDY.

05:32.375 --> 05:35.166
OH. SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

05:35.166 --> 05:39.291
I GUESS WE HAVEN'T
BEEN FOCUSING TOO MUCH
ON FUN RECENTLY.

05:39.291 --> 05:40.625
MAYBE YOU SHOULD.

05:40.625 --> 05:42.667
YOU KNOW, INVITE HIM
TO COME ALONG WITH US.

05:42.667 --> 05:43.959
OR YOU COULD--

05:43.959 --> 05:46.583
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SUGGESTING THIS--

05:46.583 --> 05:48.125
UM, JUST PLAN SOMETHING
FOR THE TWO
OF YOU ALONE.

05:48.125 --> 05:50.458
MAYBE EVEN SOMETHING...

05:50.458 --> 05:52.208
ROMANTIC.

05:52.208 --> 05:55.250
DAWSON LEERY,
I CANNOT BELIEVE

05:55.250 --> 05:57.375
THAT YOU'RE GIVING ME
RELATIONSHIP ADVICE.

05:57.375 --> 06:01.625
THERE ARE EASIER THINGS
IN THE WORLD, YEAH.

06:01.625 --> 06:03.166
[BELL RINGS]

06:03.166 --> 06:03.667
ANYWAY...

06:06.041 --> 06:07.917
DAWSON.

06:07.917 --> 06:08.583
YEAH?

06:12.542 --> 06:13.875
NOTHING.

06:20.583 --> 06:23.333
MS. SULLIVAN,
MR. WEINERT,

06:23.333 --> 06:28.834
AND...OF COURSE,
MR. WITTER.

06:28.834 --> 06:29.959
HERE.

06:29.959 --> 06:33.542
WHAT A DELIGHT IT IS
TO HAVE YOU RETURN.

06:33.542 --> 06:37.125
TELL ME, DID YOU
THINK OF US

06:37.125 --> 06:39.875
WHILE YOU WERE
ON HIATUS?

06:39.875 --> 06:41.041
EVERY DAY.

06:41.041 --> 06:43.750
WHAT'S THAT?

06:43.750 --> 06:46.458
IT'S ALL 4 ASSIGNMENTS THAT
I MISSED WHILE I WAS GONE.

06:46.458 --> 06:47.708
I DIDN'T WANT
TO RUN THE RISK

06:47.708 --> 06:49.625
OF GETTING AN INCOMPLETE
ON ANY OF THEM.

06:49.625 --> 06:52.792
I'LL BE SURE TO
TAKE YOUR DILIGENCE
INTO CONSIDERATION.

06:52.792 --> 06:54.500
AND THIS IS YOUR POETRY
ASSIGNMENT.

06:54.500 --> 06:58.166
I'M SORRY YOU WEREN'T
ABLE TO GET IT BACK
SOONER.

07:00.125 --> 07:01.125
WHAT EXACTLY
WAS WRONG WITH THIS?

07:01.125 --> 07:03.708
WELL...

07:03.708 --> 07:08.417
IN MY EDUCATED
EDITORIAL ANALYSIS...

07:08.417 --> 07:09.542
IT STUNK.

07:09.542 --> 07:13.041
SO AS MY TEACHER, YOU HAVE
NO COMMENTS OR ADVICE

07:13.041 --> 07:14.333
ON HOW I MIGHT COMPOSE
A POEM MORE TO YOUR LIKING.

07:14.333 --> 07:17.917
YES. WRITE BETTER.

07:17.917 --> 07:18.917
FROM NOW ON, PEOPLE,

07:18.917 --> 07:21.417
YOUR GRADES WILL BE
SUBJECTIVE,

07:21.417 --> 07:24.291
WHIM TO
MY PERSONAL TASTE.

07:24.291 --> 07:26.291
THOSE OF YOU WITH
INTELLIGENCE, TALENT,
AND ABILITY

07:26.291 --> 07:28.125
WILL HAVE NO PROBLEMS.

07:28.125 --> 07:29.792
AND THE REST OF YOU

07:29.792 --> 07:34.208
SHOULD COME TO TERMS
WITH YOUR INEVITABLE
FAILURE.

07:35.708 --> 07:38.708
HE'S SETTING IT UP
TO FAIL ME.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.625
AND YOU CAN'T DROP IT
BECAUSE IT'S HALFWAY
THROUGH THE SEMESTER.

07:40.625 --> 07:43.333
BINGO. WHICH PUTS ME
AT ABOUT A 7.4

07:43.333 --> 07:44.750
ON THE SCREWED
RICHTER.

07:47.834 --> 07:50.166
OR MAKE THAT A 7.8.

07:50.166 --> 07:51.625
THE PHASE OF MASSIVE
DESTRUCTION.

07:54.458 --> 07:55.500
GO TALK TO HER.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.542
SHE SAW ME. SHE COULD
COME OVER HERE.

07:57.542 --> 07:59.792
PACEY. GO.

07:59.792 --> 08:03.208
I WILL. I JUST WANT
TO GIVE IT A SECOND.

08:05.250 --> 08:06.375
WHAT'S THIS?

08:06.375 --> 08:09.625
A MENU.
I REALIZE THAT.

08:09.625 --> 08:11.625
IF YOU DON'T
LIKE ANYTHING,
JUST LET ME KNOW.

08:11.625 --> 08:12.959
IT'S WHAT I'LL BE
COOKING TONIGHT.

08:12.959 --> 08:14.959
FOR WHO?

08:14.959 --> 08:16.583
YOU AND ME.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.875
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
THE DINNER TO
END ALL DINNERS.

08:18.875 --> 08:19.583
AT MY HOUSE ON THE DOCK.

08:19.583 --> 08:22.041
AND I WAS THINKING...

08:22.041 --> 08:23.542
WHEREVER IT LEADS TO
FROM THERE,

08:23.542 --> 08:28.166
I GUESS, ONLY
THE FATES CAN SAY.

08:28.166 --> 08:29.875
THAT SOUNDS ROMANTIC.

08:29.875 --> 08:33.667
WELL, THAT'S
THE PLAN, STAN.

08:33.667 --> 08:35.667
YOU'RE SOMETHING ELSE, JOEY.

08:35.667 --> 08:38.332
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO
WITHOUT YOU SUPPORTING ME
THROUGH ALL THIS.

08:38.332 --> 08:42.582
WELL, IT GOES WITH
THE TERRITORY OF KIND OF
DIGGIN' YOU.

09:07.125 --> 09:08.125
HI.

09:08.125 --> 09:10.166
HI.

09:11.917 --> 09:13.208
YOU HAVEN'T CALLED.

09:13.208 --> 09:16.375
LAST I CHECKED, MY PHONE
HAD AN INCOMING LINE.

09:16.375 --> 09:19.166
YOU LEFT ME STRANDED
ON A PIER

09:19.166 --> 09:22.375
AFTER TELLING ME
THAT I WAS WEAK
AND INSENSITIVE.

09:22.375 --> 09:23.667
I REALLY WASN'T UP
FOR TALKING TO YOU.

09:23.667 --> 09:25.708
AND YOU JUDGED AND ABANDONED
ME WHEN I NEEDED YOU THE MOST.

09:25.708 --> 09:27.917
I THOUGHT I'D WAIT
FOR YOUR CALL.

09:27.917 --> 09:30.375
MY CALL? I SHOULD
CALL AND SAY WHAT?

09:30.375 --> 09:31.625
FOR STARTERS,
"I'M SORRY."

09:31.625 --> 09:33.959
I AGREE. "I'M SORRY"
WOULD BE NICE TO HEAR.

09:36.417 --> 09:38.000
LOOK, WAS THERE ANYTHING
ELSE YOU WANTED?

09:38.000 --> 09:40.542
BECAUSE WE DON'T
SEEM TO BE MAKING
ANY PROGRESS HERE.

09:40.542 --> 09:41.458
I SAW YOU SITTING HERE,

09:41.458 --> 09:42.917
I THOUGHT I'D COME
AND SAY HELLO.

09:42.917 --> 09:45.166
ANY PROGRESS BEYOND THAT
I HADN'T CONSIDERED.

09:45.166 --> 09:46.291
WELL, CONSIDER THIS.

09:46.291 --> 09:49.917
HELLO IS TYPICALLY
FOLLOWED BY ONE THING.

09:49.917 --> 09:51.000
GOOD-BYE.

09:55.291 --> 09:57.917
WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

09:57.917 --> 09:59.458
OH, I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

09:59.458 --> 10:01.708
I'M LATE TO MEET
WITH MR. MILO.

10:01.708 --> 10:03.083
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

10:03.083 --> 10:05.083
IT'S NOTHING. I DIDN'T
WANT TO BOTHER YOU.

10:05.083 --> 10:07.291
IT'S JUST HE'S BEEN
CALLING FOR MOM LATELY,
AND I'VE BEEN COVERING.

10:07.291 --> 10:10.750
AND FINALLY, HE JUST
ASKED ME TO COME IN,
THAT'S ALL.

10:10.750 --> 10:11.625

IT'S IN THE BIBLE.

22:07.792 --> 22:09.959
HEY, MRS. RYAN,
WHAT'S THE CHAPTER

22:09.959 --> 22:13.458
THAT CONDEMNS
HOMOSEXUALITY AS A SIN?

22:13.458 --> 22:15.417
I BELIEVE IT'S IN
THE BOOK OF LEVITICUS.

22:15.417 --> 22:16.708
GRAMS, STAY OUT OF THIS.

22:16.708 --> 22:19.417
PLEASE. OK? I AM NOT GONNA
LET YOU TWO GANG UP ON ME HERE.

22:19.417 --> 22:22.667
HOW CAN YOU HAVE SUCH
A NARROW VIEW ABOUT BEING GAY?

22:22.667 --> 22:24.792
HOW CAN YOUR VIEW BE
SO NARROWLY LIBERAL?

22:24.792 --> 22:26.208
TY, YOU'RE NO SAINT.
YOU KNOW THAT.

22:26.208 --> 22:27.708
I DON'T CLAIM TO BE.

22:27.708 --> 22:30.000
BUT ONE DAY I'M
GONNA HAVE TO ANSWER
TO THE BIG MAN

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
AND SO WILL JACK.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.125
AND IF HE'S READY

22:32.125 --> 22:33.667
TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR HIS ACTIONS

22:33.667 --> 22:35.208
THEN HE CAN DO
WHATEVER HE WANTS.

22:35.208 --> 22:36.250
I JUST THINK
THAT HIS KIND

22:36.250 --> 22:37.875
IS DAMAGING
TO THE WORLD AT LARGE.

22:37.875 --> 22:40.417
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU.

22:40.417 --> 22:42.625
FOR YOU TO SUGGEST THAT
SOMEBODY CAN JUST MAGICALLY

22:42.625 --> 22:44.583
DECIDE TO BE GAY IS INSANE.

22:44.583 --> 22:45.583
THE FACTS
DON'T LIE, JEN.

22:45.583 --> 22:47.000
THE GAY MOVEMENT
HAS BEEN NOTHING

22:47.000 --> 22:50.125
BUT MEDICALLY
AND MORALLY DAMAGING
TO THIS COUNTRY.

22:50.125 --> 22:51.750
I'VE TRIED TO STAY
OUT OF THIS.

22:51.750 --> 22:54.041
I HAVE. BUT I CAN'T,
JENNIFER.

22:54.041 --> 22:55.458
NOW, IF YOU JUST
LET ME EXPLAIN.

22:55.458 --> 22:56.708
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU GUYS
MORAL MAJORITY ME HERE.

22:56.708 --> 22:59.375
I MEAN, YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW ALL THE FACTS.

22:59.375 --> 23:00.375
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY ISN'T
DIRECTED AT YOU, JEN.

23:00.375 --> 23:02.166
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY
IS FOR TYSON.

23:02.166 --> 23:04.041
ALL I'M SAYING IS--

23:04.041 --> 23:05.208
IF JACK IS GAY,

23:05.208 --> 23:08.208
HE DOES NOT NEED
YOUR JUDGMENT, YOUNG MAN.

23:08.208 --> 23:10.667
THE LORD ABOVE WILL BE
THE ONE TO JUDGE HIM

23:10.667 --> 23:11.375
AS HE WILL ALL OF US.

23:11.375 --> 23:13.583
WHAT HE NEEDS FROM YOU,

23:13.583 --> 23:15.792
FROM ME, FROM EVERYONE
ELSE IN THIS WORLD

23:15.792 --> 23:17.041
IS LOVE AND TOLERANCE.

23:17.041 --> 23:21.500
IF ANYTHING, THAT BOY
MUST FEEL SCARED AND ALONE

23:21.500 --> 23:24.000
AND HE WILL NEED
THE UNDERSTANDING
OF HIS FELLOW MAN

23:24.000 --> 23:25.041
TO HELP HIM THROUGH THIS.

23:25.041 --> 23:27.458
LET'S SAVE JUDGMENT
FOR SOMEONE

23:27.458 --> 23:29.583
MUCH MORE EXPERIENCED
THAN YOU.

23:45.417 --> 23:48.166
YOU KNOW, YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO WALK ME HOME.

23:48.917 --> 23:50.542
WELL, MAYBE I WANTED TO.

23:58.583 --> 24:00.583
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

24:01.959 --> 24:04.792
MMM. OK, I GUESS.

24:06.208 --> 24:09.291
BLUES CLUB JUST
MAKE YOU MORE BLUE?

24:12.041 --> 24:13.208
YEAH.

24:13.208 --> 24:16.166
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

24:17.917 --> 24:21.083
IT'S STUPID.

24:21.083 --> 24:24.333
IF IT'S STUPID
YOU'RE TALKING TO
THE RIGHT PERSON. OK?

24:24.333 --> 24:26.250
I HAPPEN TO HAVE
A WEALTH OF EXPERIENCE

24:26.250 --> 24:28.166
WHEN IT COMES
TO STUPIDITY.

24:28.166 --> 24:32.291
DAWSON, CAN I
ASK YOU SOMETHING...

24:32.291 --> 24:33.458
STRAIGHTFORWARD
AND HONEST?

24:33.458 --> 24:35.625
YEAH. YOU KNOW YOU CAN.

24:39.083 --> 24:41.458
UM...

24:46.625 --> 24:48.375
AM I SEXUAL?

24:48.375 --> 24:49.166
WHAT?

24:49.166 --> 24:51.667
THE THING IS, UM,

24:51.667 --> 24:53.250
I KNOW THAT JACK'S NOT GAY,

24:53.250 --> 24:56.625
BUT I MEAN, HE'S OBVIOUSLY
CONFUSED ABOUT SOMETHING

24:56.625 --> 25:01.625
AND IT'S ALWAYS KEPT HIM
AT A DISTANCE. AND...

25:01.625 --> 25:06.000
I WAS JUST WONDERING IF
HE CHOSE ME BECAUSE I'M SAFE.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.667
YOU'RE SAFE?

25:07.667 --> 25:09.834
I MEAN, LOOK AT ME.

25:09.834 --> 25:12.417
I'M JOEY POTTER,
VIRGIN AT LARGE.

25:12.417 --> 25:16.500
I DON'T HAVE ANY REAL
EXPERIENCE WITH MEN

25:16.500 --> 25:18.583
OR RELATIONSHIPS OR SEX.

25:18.583 --> 25:23.208
JOEY, YOU ARE
EXTREMELY SEXUAL.

25:23.208 --> 25:24.959
BUT YOU DIDN'T SEE IT.

25:24.959 --> 25:27.333
I MEAN, YOU FELL FOR JEN.

25:27.333 --> 25:30.333
SEX MACHINE, AND...

25:30.333 --> 25:33.333
I WAS SOMETHING ELSE
TO YOU.

25:33.333 --> 25:35.333
JOEY, I WAS JUST STUPID.

25:37.834 --> 25:40.166
IT TOOK ME TIME TO SEE
WHAT WAS THERE.

25:41.333 --> 25:42.917
SO WHAT WAS THERE?

25:42.917 --> 25:47.792
WHAT WAS THERE WAS
AN AMAZINGLY SEXY GIRL.

25:52.417 --> 25:55.375
JOEY, YOUR SEXUALITY IS
IN EVERYTHING YOU DO.

25:55.375 --> 25:56.542
YOUR WIT,
YOUR INTELLIGENCE,

25:56.542 --> 26:00.583
YOUR ANGER,
YOUR FEISTINESS.

26:00.583 --> 26:01.792
I SEE IT MORE
AND MORE EVERY DAY.

26:03.750 --> 26:05.542
YOU'RE BLOSSOMING.

26:05.542 --> 26:08.625
AND IT'S AMAZINGLY SEXY.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.708
THANKS, DAWSON.

26:14.542 --> 26:17.041
LOOK...

26:17.041 --> 26:20.708
I DON'T THINK
THE QUESTION IS WHY
DID JACK CHOSE YOU.

26:20.708 --> 26:24.083
I THINK THE REAL
QUESTION IS WHY DID
YOU CHOOSE JACK?

26:34.542 --> 26:36.375
GOOD NIGHT.

26:36.375 --> 26:38.708
GOOD NIGHT, DAWSON.

26:50.750 --> 26:51.875
PRINCIPAL MARKEY.

26:51.875 --> 26:54.583
PACEY. JUDGING FROM
YOUR TARDY RECORDS

26:54.583 --> 26:55.458
I DIDN'T THINK YOU
ROSE BEFORE 10:00.

26:55.458 --> 26:57.041
WELL, RISING
REQUIRES SLEEPING,

26:57.041 --> 27:00.208
AND I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO DO THAT LAST NIGHT.

27:00.208 --> 27:01.250
THIS IS FOR YOU.

27:01.250 --> 27:02.458
WHAT IS IT?

27:02.458 --> 27:04.000
IT'S A DOCUMENT
I PREPARED.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.625
I CHECKED OUT
THE STATE BY-LAWS

27:05.625 --> 27:07.625
ON PROFESSIONAL
ETHICS FOR TEACHERS.

27:07.625 --> 27:10.208
MR. PETERSON'S
IN VIOLATION OF
ALMOST EVERY ONE.

27:10.208 --> 27:11.708
WHAT'S YOUR POINT HERE?

27:13.792 --> 27:15.166
"ALL EDUCATORS
SHALL MAINTAIN

27:15.166 --> 27:17.959
"PROFESSIONAL
RELATIONSHIPS

"IN A MANNER WHICH IS
FREE OF VINDICTIVENESS,

AND HARASSMENT."

27:21.417 --> 27:22.500
WANT ME TO KEEP READING?

27:22.500 --> 27:23.458
WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING?

27:23.458 --> 27:24.458
THAT I CALL MR. PETERSON
TO MY OFFICE,

27:24.458 --> 27:25.917
GIVE HIM SATURDAY DETENTION?

27:25.917 --> 27:28.041
NO. YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO ANYTHING.

27:28.041 --> 27:31.166
THAT FOLDER
CONTAINS OVER 20
OTHER TESTIMONIES

27:31.166 --> 27:32.875
FROM STUDENTS
I GATHERED LAST NIGHT.

27:32.875 --> 27:34.708
THERE'S A SCHOOL BOARD
MEETING ON TUESDAY.

27:34.708 --> 27:36.375
I SENT A COPY
TO EVERY MEMBER OF THE BOARD.

27:36.375 --> 27:38.750
I WANT THIS MAN PUBLICLY
REPRIMANDED FOR HIS BEHAVIOR.

27:38.750 --> 27:39.834
[SIGHS]

27:39.834 --> 27:41.417
PACEY, I HOPE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

27:41.417 --> 27:45.875
I'M SORRY IF I HAD
TO GO AROUND YOU,
PRINCIPAL MARKEY.

27:45.875 --> 27:48.375
I WAS JUST TRYING TO DO
THE BEST I COULD

27:48.375 --> 27:50.625
WITHIN MY GIVEN SET
OF CIRCUMSTANCES.

28:03.875 --> 28:05.333
DADDY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

28:05.333 --> 28:06.500
I HAVE TO GET BACK.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.542
I'VE GOT 3 MEETINGS
THIS AFTERNOON.

28:08.542 --> 28:12.834
HERE ARE THE NAMES
OF SOME NURSE COMPANIES
FOR YOUR MOTHER.

28:12.834 --> 28:15.083
WE'LL GET SOME HELP
IN HERE FOR YOU.

28:15.083 --> 28:18.333
WELL, CAN'T YOU STAY
ANY LONGER?

28:18.333 --> 28:21.458
NO. I'M SORRY.
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

28:21.458 --> 28:24.166
BUT YOU SAID WE'D DISCUSS IT,
AND WE HAVEN'T YET.

28:24.166 --> 28:25.500
ANDIE, DON'T GET
EMOTIONAL.

28:25.500 --> 28:28.208
I'LL BE BACK
IN A FEW WEEKS.

28:28.208 --> 28:31.041
BUT--
DON'T BOTHER.

28:31.041 --> 28:32.625
EXCUSE ME?

28:32.625 --> 28:34.875
I SAID DON'T BOTHER
COMING BACK.

28:34.875 --> 28:38.166
JACK, DADDY AND I ARE
TALKING RIGHT NOW, OK?

28:38.166 --> 28:40.041
PLEASE JUST LET US TALK.

28:40.041 --> 28:41.542
WOULD YOU LIKE TO
EXPLAIN YOUR COMMENT?

28:41.542 --> 28:43.625
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE HERE,

28:43.625 --> 28:44.959
SO DON'T COME BACK.

28:44.959 --> 28:46.625
WE HAVE EVERYTHING
UNDER CONTROL.

28:46.625 --> 28:48.291
SAVE YOURSELF
THE GAS MILEAGE.

28:48.291 --> 28:49.834
I WILL NOT SUFFER
THAT TONE FROM YOU,

28:49.834 --> 28:51.500
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
I WORK TOO HARD.

28:51.500 --> 28:53.083
THAT'S ALWAYS
THE EXCUSE, ISN'T IT?

28:53.083 --> 28:54.250
YOU WORK TOO HARD.

28:54.250 --> 28:56.542
WELL, I COULDN'T CARE LESS
HOW HARD YOU WORK.

28:56.542 --> 28:58.583
WHAT'S THE SENSE IN TRYING
TO SUPPORT A FAMILY

28:58.583 --> 28:59.750
THAT YOU DON'T
CARE ABOUT?

28:59.750 --> 29:02.083
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
GOOD-BYE, ANDIE.

29:02.083 --> 29:03.291
I'LL CALL YOU
IN A FEW DAYS.

29:03.291 --> 29:05.208
NO. NO. YOU'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

29:05.208 --> 29:06.375
YOU GET OUT
OF THAT DOORWAY.

29:06.375 --> 29:07.417
NO. THIS IS
ONE CONVERSATION

29:07.417 --> 29:09.375
THAT YOU CAN'T
RUN AWAY FROM.

29:10.875 --> 29:14.542
YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT TIM'S DEATH.

29:14.542 --> 29:18.208
ABOUT MOM BEING SICK
OR EVEN WHY SHE'S SICK.

29:18.208 --> 29:19.750
YOU DON'T WANT
TO ADDRESS THE REALITY

29:19.750 --> 29:20.792
OF WHY YOUR DAUGHTER'S

29:20.792 --> 29:22.333
BEEN ON AND OFF
PRESCRIPTIVE DRUGS

29:22.333 --> 29:23.959
FOR THE LAST 2 YEARS,
THAT'S FINE, TOO.

29:23.959 --> 29:24.625
BUT WE ARE GONNA
TALK ABOUT ME!

29:24.625 --> 29:26.959
YOU CALM YOURSELF DOWN!

29:26.959 --> 29:28.208
NO. I WILL
NOT CALM DOWN!

29:28.208 --> 29:29.750
AND I WILL NOT BE QUIET.

29:29.750 --> 29:32.291
YOU WANT
TO RESOLVE THIS?

29:32.291 --> 29:33.667
THEN YOU ASK ME AGAIN.

29:33.667 --> 29:34.792
ASK YOU WHAT?

29:34.792 --> 29:38.667
THE QUESTION. ASK ME
THE QUESTION AGAIN.

29:38.667 --> 29:42.333
ASK ME IF I'M GAY.

29:43.917 --> 29:45.708
ASK ME.

29:45.708 --> 29:47.125
YOU ARE NOT GAY.

29:47.125 --> 29:48.792
YES, I AM!

29:50.708 --> 29:52.875
YOU KNOW IT.

29:54.625 --> 29:56.291
I SEE HOW
YOU LOOK AT ME,

29:56.291 --> 29:58.083
AND I KNOW YOU KNOW.

30:00.375 --> 30:02.625
THINK ABOUT THE WAY
THAT YOU TREATED ME

30:02.625 --> 30:04.166
AND THE WAY THAT
YOU TREATED TIM.

30:06.875 --> 30:10.000
BECAUSE HE WAS
THE REAL SON,

30:10.000 --> 30:12.208
AND I WAS DIFFERENT.

30:12.208 --> 30:15.458
AND AS HARD AS YOU'VE
TRIED TO STAMP IT OUT

30:15.458 --> 30:18.417
AND TO IGNORE IT,
I HAVE TRIED HARDER!

30:18.417 --> 30:21.083
I HAVE TRIED HARDER
THAN YOU TO BE QUIET

30:21.083 --> 30:23.500
AND TO FORGET IT

30:23.500 --> 30:26.083
AND TO NOT BOTHER
MY FAMILY WITH
MY PROBLEM.

30:34.458 --> 30:36.875
BUT I CAN'T TRY ANYMORE.

30:36.875 --> 30:39.250
BECAUSE IT HURTS.

30:43.417 --> 30:45.917
I'M SORRY, DAD.

30:47.625 --> 30:51.166
ANDIE, I'M SORRY.

30:53.291 --> 30:58.000
I DON'T WANT TO BE GOING
THROUGH THIS, BUT I AM.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.542
[SOBBING]

30:59.542 --> 31:01.875
JACK.

31:02.917 --> 31:06.166
STOP CRYING.
BOTH OF YOU.

31:09.250 --> 31:11.625
I SAID STOP CRYING.

31:11.625 --> 31:12.917
LEAVE.

31:12.917 --> 31:17.250
ANDIE, THIS IS BETWEEN
JACK AND ME.

31:17.250 --> 31:20.000
NOT ANYMORE, IT'S NOT.

31:23.667 --> 31:26.875
JUST LEAVE.
GET OUT OF HERE.

32:10.166 --> 32:10.708
JOEY!

32:10.708 --> 32:11.834
HEY.
HEY!

32:11.834 --> 32:14.041
YOU SURVIVED
YOUR DINNER.

32:14.041 --> 32:15.500
YEAH, BARELY.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.917
LISTEN, CAN WE
MAKE A PLAN TO SEE
EACH OTHER TONIGHT?

32:17.917 --> 32:21.291
SURE. CALLING IN
YOUR RAIN CHECK?

32:21.291 --> 32:23.291
YEAH. I REALLY
NEED IT.

32:23.291 --> 32:27.250
OK. I GUESS
UNTIL TONIGHT, THEN.

32:27.250 --> 32:28.333
OK.

32:28.333 --> 32:29.417
BYE.

32:29.417 --> 32:30.834
I'LL SEE YOU.

32:34.041 --> 32:35.083
BYE.

32:48.625 --> 32:51.667
WHAT'S GOING ON?

32:51.667 --> 32:54.000
UM...
NO PETERSON TODAY.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.708
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO
GO TO STUDY HALL
IN THE LIBRARY.

32:57.792 --> 32:58.166
OH.

33:08.458 --> 33:09.542
UH, PACEY.

33:09.542 --> 33:10.917
YEAH?

33:10.917 --> 33:14.208
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING FOR A WHILE.

33:14.208 --> 33:16.792
UM...THANK YOU.

33:18.750 --> 33:21.041
YOU'RE WELCOME, MAN.

33:49.667 --> 33:52.250
SO, WHY ISN'T CLASS
IN SESSION?

33:52.250 --> 33:55.708
OH, YOU DIDN'T GET
THE LATEST UPDATE?

33:55.708 --> 33:57.333
YOUR FAVORITE TEACHER
IS LEAVING

33:57.333 --> 33:59.333
THIS GODFORSAKEN
INSTITUTION.

33:59.333 --> 34:00.792
I DON'T GET IT.

34:00.792 --> 34:02.667
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN MET
WITH THE BOARD YET.

34:02.667 --> 34:06.625
PLEASE. DID YOU
REALLY THINK THAT
I WOULD APPEAR

34:06.625 --> 34:13.083
BEFORE SOME COLLECTION
OF IDIOT PARENTS AND
HAVE THEM TELL ME...

34:14.417 --> 34:18.250
WHAT I'VE DONE WRONG
FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS?

34:20.583 --> 34:23.250
I'D RATHER EAT DIRT.

34:25.041 --> 34:29.792
I WAS, UH--I WAS PLANNING
ON RETIRING IN 6 MONTHS.

34:29.792 --> 34:33.208
YOUR ACTION GAVE ME
EVERY REASON IN THE WORLD
TO MAKE AN EARLY EXIT.

34:37.208 --> 34:40.333
MR. PETERSON, THIS
MAY FEEL A LITTLE LATE
IN COMING,

34:40.333 --> 34:41.750
BUT I AM SORRY.

34:41.750 --> 34:44.625
THAT STUNT
THAT YOU PULLED

34:44.625 --> 34:48.208
WAS ONE OF THE FEW
ADMIRABLE MOMENTS
IN YOUR LIFE.

34:48.208 --> 34:50.542
DON'T RUIN IT
WITH AN APOLOGY.

34:50.542 --> 34:52.542
YOU ARE
UNBELIEVABLE, MAN.

34:52.542 --> 34:55.375
WHAT IS IT INSIDE
OF YOU THAT MAKES
YOU SO DAMN MEAN?

34:58.417 --> 35:05.250
MR. WITTER, AS AWFUL A MAN
AS YOU FIND ME TO BE...

35:05.250 --> 35:09.250
YOU CAME HERE
TO LEARN FROM ME.

35:09.250 --> 35:11.208
I HAVE LEARNED, SIR.

35:11.208 --> 35:14.125
I'VE LEARNED
THAT RESPECT

35:14.125 --> 35:17.250
IS NOT COMMANDED
THROUGH FEAR.
IT'S EARNED...

35:17.250 --> 35:19.417
THROUGH COMPASSION.

35:29.959 --> 35:31.291
THEN TELL ME THIS...

35:34.333 --> 35:37.333
SHOULD I RESPECT YOU?

35:37.333 --> 35:41.667
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE
FOR ENDING MY CAREER.

35:41.667 --> 35:44.375
WHERE'S THE COMPASSION
IN THAT?

36:11.708 --> 36:14.834
I COME IN PEACE...

36:14.834 --> 36:19.166
NURSING MY WOUNDED EGO,
HOPING FOR REDEMPTION.

36:20.208 --> 36:21.291
TY, THIS ISN'T
GONNA WORK OUT.

36:21.291 --> 36:25.500
I'M SORRY.
THERE'S...

36:25.500 --> 36:29.500
THERE'S JUST TOO MANY
DIFFERENCES, AND...

36:29.500 --> 36:32.959
AND I CAN'T SEEM
TO GET BEYOND SOME OF
YOUR INHERENT VIEWS.

36:34.333 --> 36:35.083
SO...

36:35.083 --> 36:37.792
SO, WE CAN'T DISAGREE?

36:39.208 --> 36:41.166
I THOUGHT
A RELATIONSHIP

36:41.166 --> 36:42.667
WAS ABOUT GROWING
TOGETHER.

36:42.667 --> 36:45.667
LOOK, IF YOU THINK
THAT MY BELIEFS
ARE WRONG,

36:45.667 --> 36:48.333
THEN TEACH ME...
SHOW ME ANOTHER WAY.

36:48.333 --> 36:49.417
TY, IT'S NOT THAT EASY.

36:49.417 --> 36:51.041
WHAT RELATIONSHIPS
ARE EASY?

36:51.041 --> 36:55.291
ALL I'M SAYING IS
THAT I'M OPEN-MINDED.

36:56.542 --> 37:00.125
MY NARROW-MINDED WAYS
ARE OPEN FOR DISCUSSION.

37:01.375 --> 37:04.834
WHAT ABOUT
YOUR LIBERAL VIEWS?

37:04.834 --> 37:06.250
ARE THEY AS OPEN?

37:07.333 --> 37:12.291
YOU ARE...
A WONDERFUL...

37:12.291 --> 37:13.417
BEAUTIFUL GIRL.

37:14.708 --> 37:20.500
CAN'T WE JUST...
SEE WHAT HAPPENS
NEXT?

37:21.542 --> 37:24.583
YOU CERTAINLY HAVE
A CHARM, DON'T YOU?

37:41.166 --> 37:42.583
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR YOU.

37:42.583 --> 37:45.417
NO. ACTUALLY, I CAME
TO TALK TO YOU, ANDIE.

37:45.417 --> 37:47.208
NO, NO. BEFORE YOU
SAY A WORD, PACEY,

37:47.208 --> 37:49.917
I NEED TO SAY SOMETHING.
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE.

37:49.917 --> 37:51.458
I CAME TO APOLOGIZE.

37:51.458 --> 37:53.500
NO, I SHOULD BE THE ONE.
I'VE BEEN TREATING
YOU SO UNFAIRLY--

37:53.500 --> 37:55.917
BUT I HURT YOU WITH
MY LITTLE CRUSADE.

37:55.917 --> 37:58.250
I NEVER STOPPED TO
THINK ABOUT HOW IT
WOULD AFFECT YOU.

37:58.250 --> 37:59.625
I GOT OBSESSED.
WAIT A MINUTE.

37:59.625 --> 38:01.750
WHY DO YOU GET
TO BE THE ONLY ONE
WHO APOLOGIZES?

38:01.750 --> 38:02.750
WHY ARE YOU ARGUING
WITH ME ABOUT IT?

38:02.750 --> 38:05.291
BECAUSE I FAILED YOU.
I WAS SELF-RIGHTEOUS

38:05.291 --> 38:07.625
TO THE POINT OF
ALIENATING EVERYTHING
I CARE ABOUT.

38:07.625 --> 38:10.500
I FORCED YOU TO TRY
AND LIVE UP TO THESE
UNREACHABLE EXPECTATIONS--

38:10.500 --> 38:14.959
ANDIE, PLEASE...
JUST SHUT UP AND
LET ME APOLOGIZE, OK?

38:14.959 --> 38:18.750
THIS LAST WEEK
WITHOUT YOU HAS BEEN
A LIVING HELL,

38:18.750 --> 38:20.625
AND I DON'T EVER WANT
TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH

38:20.625 --> 38:22.083
ANOTHER MOMENT
LIKE THAT.

38:22.083 --> 38:23.542
I'M SORRY, McPHEE.

38:25.750 --> 38:26.542
YOU'RE FORGIVEN, PACEY.

38:33.625 --> 38:34.917
SO, YOUR TURN NOW.

38:34.917 --> 38:37.417
YEAH, UM...

38:38.583 --> 38:40.792
IT'S JUST THAT...

38:40.792 --> 38:46.000
I MOLDED YOU
INTO THIS PERSON WHO I
THOUGHT YOU SHOULD BE.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
I DID IT TO
MY FATHER, TOO.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.125
I THOUGHT IT WAS
WHAT I NEEDED.

38:50.125 --> 38:52.750
I PLACE THIS
UNFAIR BURDEN ON PEOPLE

38:52.750 --> 38:55.875
JUST SO THEY CAN
SAVE ME FROM MYSELF.

38:55.875 --> 39:00.041
BUT I REALIZE I DON'T NEED
A KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR.

39:00.041 --> 39:01.417
WHAT I NEED IS A PARTNER,

39:01.417 --> 39:03.917
SOMEONE WHO I CAN BE
PROUD TO LOVE,

39:03.917 --> 39:09.000
AND WHO'S PROUD TO LOVE
ME BACK IN SPITE OF
ALL MY FAULTS.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.708
AND...THAT'S YOU.

39:11.708 --> 39:14.750
YOU'RE THE ONE, PACEY.

39:14.750 --> 39:17.166
AND I'M REALLY SORRY.

39:17.166 --> 39:20.583
HOW COME YOUR APOLOGY
WAS SO MUCH BETTER
THAN MINE?

39:21.667 --> 39:23.000
I ALWAYS LOSE
TO YOU, ANDIE.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.041
HMM.

39:36.417 --> 39:39.208
MMM. I TAKE THAT BACK.

39:40.542 --> 39:42.792
I'M DEFINITELY
THE WINNER HERE.

40:01.792 --> 40:03.417
HEY! YOU'RE EARLY.

40:03.417 --> 40:05.250
I HAVEN'T FINISHED
LIGHTING THE CANDLES,

40:05.250 --> 40:07.000
AND THE FOOD'S
STILL INSIDE.

40:09.250 --> 40:11.542
WOW. JOEY, THIS
IS MAGNIFICENT.

40:11.542 --> 40:13.834
YEAH, I'D BE
PRETTY IMPRESSED
IF I WERE YOU.

40:13.834 --> 40:15.250
YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE DONE THIS.

40:15.250 --> 40:17.166
AH, I WANTED TO.

40:17.166 --> 40:18.583
I KNOW...

40:18.583 --> 40:20.875
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

40:24.750 --> 40:25.959
THIS...

40:25.959 --> 40:28.542
THIS IS THE PART WHERE
I SAY "UH-OH," RIGHT?

40:29.166 --> 40:31.792
LOOK, JOEY, UH...

40:33.333 --> 40:35.208
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY, REALLY,

40:35.208 --> 40:36.583
OR EVEN WHERE TO...

40:36.583 --> 40:38.500
JUST BE HONEST
WITH ME.

40:38.500 --> 40:43.834
I MEAN, THIS TIME,
JUST...BE HONEST.

40:43.834 --> 40:44.667
PLEASE?

40:58.417 --> 41:01.708
THIS MORNING,
I TOLD MY FATHER
THAT I WAS GAY.

41:09.125 --> 41:09.583
SO YOU ARE.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.583
YOU'RE GAY.

41:13.583 --> 41:16.291
WELL...I MEAN...NOT...

41:16.291 --> 41:17.417
YOU'RE NOT GAY?

41:17.417 --> 41:18.625
NO...

41:18.625 --> 41:19.750
PART GAY?

41:21.667 --> 41:24.792
NO...PLEASE, DON'T
LAUGH AT ME, JACK,

41:24.792 --> 41:29.959
'CAUSE, UM...
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO SAY, OK?

41:29.959 --> 41:31.333
UM...

41:34.041 --> 41:35.708
ARE YOU GAY?

41:45.583 --> 41:47.708
WHEN I WROTE
THAT POEM...

41:51.458 --> 41:53.333
IT CLICKED SOMETHING
INSIDE OF ME

41:53.333 --> 41:55.917
THAT HAS BEEN QUIET
FOR SO LONG.

42:02.583 --> 42:05.083
AND IT MADE ME REALIZE...

42:05.083 --> 42:07.959
THAT WHATEVER IT IS
I'M GOING THROUGH IS
NOT GONNA GO AWAY.

42:09.291 --> 42:09.667
MAYBE EVER.

42:12.834 --> 42:15.000
JOEY, I CARE
ABOUT YOU SO MUCH.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.125
YOU'VE BEEN SUCH
A GOOD FRIEND TO ME,

42:17.125 --> 42:19.750
WHICH IS WHY I CAN'T STAND
THE THOUGHT OF LOSING YOU.

42:22.583 --> 42:24.542
BUT I DON'T WANNA
HURT YOU, EITHER.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.166
LOOK, I, UM...

42:28.375 --> 42:29.750
I KNOW THE REST.

42:36.708 --> 42:39.875
THANK YOU FOR BEING
HONEST WITH ME.

42:57.625 --> 43:00.125
THANK YOU
FOR BEING YOU.

43:52.792 --> 43:54.750
JOEY?
