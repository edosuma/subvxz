00:22.960 --> 00:24.917
I hate to leave you here with all this.

00:25.080 --> 00:28.152
I'm looking forward to it.
Me and Agnes hanging out in our place.

00:28.320 --> 00:30.551
Listen to some tunes,
unpack a few boxes...

00:30.720 --> 00:32.951
...maybe even eat some strained pears.

00:33.560 --> 00:35.870
- Everything's coming together for us.
- Yeah.

00:36.040 --> 00:39.875
We've got Agnes back, got each other.
I'm an agent again.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.794
We got out of Reddington's safe house.
No more bodyguards.

00:42.960 --> 00:46.954
We have windows that we can look out of
and actually see the sky.

00:47.120 --> 00:48.440
Not bad.

00:49.120 --> 00:51.032
It's a new beginning.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.515
It's a lot to give up.

01:04.720 --> 01:06.120
No.

01:07.080 --> 01:09.117
Believe me, it's not.

01:13.120 --> 01:15.112
Someone's ready to get her groove on.

01:15.280 --> 01:16.873
I think we're gonna go old school.

01:17.040 --> 01:19.271
I'm thinking... Romantics.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.837
Okay, now I'm jealous.

01:33.800 --> 01:35.120
Tom?

02:39.800 --> 02:41.837
Agent Keen, that is so cool.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.276
I had no idea
you were so artsy-craftsy.

02:44.440 --> 02:46.716
I just found this outside my front door.

02:46.880 --> 02:48.917
- What, like a gift?
- Like a warning.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.719
Or a cry for help.

02:50.880 --> 02:53.634
This is ghoulish.
A drowning Superwoman?

02:53.800 --> 02:56.110
That's not a cape.
That's a judge's robe.

02:56.320 --> 02:58.039
Federal Judge Trisha Culpepper...

02:58.240 --> 03:00.471
...drowned in her country club pool
this morning.

03:00.640 --> 03:02.472
The guard saw her enter around 8 a.m.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.951
Thirty minutes later, 911 got a call
from an employee saying she'd drowned.

03:06.160 --> 03:08.436
Someone made this
after learning what happened...

03:08.600 --> 03:09.636
...and put it at your door?

03:09.800 --> 03:12.315
The guard saw her at 8 a.m.
I found this around 7 a.m.

03:12.480 --> 03:14.631
- An hour before she drowned.
- Or was murdered...

03:14.840 --> 03:16.832
...by a killer who left this at your door.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.390
Think it's someone from your days
at the Psych Unit?

03:19.560 --> 03:21.358
I contacted the New York Field Office.

03:21.520 --> 03:24.274
- They're sending me my files now.
- Get this to the lab.

03:24.440 --> 03:26.113
Maybe we'll get evidence or a print.

03:26.280 --> 03:28.112
Ressler, Navabi, get to the crime scene.

03:28.280 --> 03:31.239
Keen, talk to Reddington,
see if he can shed some light on this.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.715
Everything's included.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.872
The last tenant left
the furnishings behind.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.680
Just disappeared.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.993
I'd have to stick to champagnes
and White Burgundies.

03:42.200 --> 03:44.476
One spill of a red varietal...

03:44.640 --> 03:47.360
...and this heavenly sanctuary
would look like a crime scene.

03:48.640 --> 03:52.236
- White wines are good. I drink white.
- But would I be capable?

03:52.560 --> 03:56.600
Let's say somebody stops by
with a Domaine de la Romanee-Conti...

03:56.760 --> 03:58.240
...and it's a '78!

03:59.440 --> 04:02.035
Couldn't he just drink it in the kitchen?

04:03.680 --> 04:07.037
I just had a revelation.
I could drink it in the kitchen.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.919
So I'll draw up the paperwork.

04:09.080 --> 04:11.800
Month to month, right, Mr. Homan?

04:12.240 --> 04:14.152
Thank you, Pamela.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.759
I don't want to know how you did it...

04:18.920 --> 04:21.958
...or what it says about the fate
of our country that you could...

04:22.120 --> 04:26.034
...but thank you for getting the president
of the United States to pardon me.

04:27.280 --> 04:31.559
As my grandmother used to say,
it's good to have friends in low places.

04:31.720 --> 04:35.396
When Dembe said you had a case,
I thought, "How quaint."

04:35.560 --> 04:37.552
- It's not.
- You looked at the photos I sent?

04:37.720 --> 04:40.280
Yes. Judge Culpepper
was above reproach...

04:40.440 --> 04:42.671
...which means many people
would like her dead...

04:42.880 --> 04:44.997
...but none I can connect to you
in any way.

04:45.160 --> 04:48.198
I've looked at every case file
from my time at Mobile Psych Unit.

04:48.360 --> 04:49.840
No suspect's an obvious match.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.593
Any leads off the diorama?

04:51.760 --> 04:53.831
A partial print, but inconclusive.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.390
I'll have a team at your apartment
within the hour.

04:56.560 --> 04:59.598
No, that's not necessary.
Whoever did it does not want to hurt me.

04:59.760 --> 05:02.639
They want to match wits with me.
See if I can catch them.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.837
Do not take this lightly.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.719
This is your next Blacklister.

05:06.880 --> 05:08.553
But you don't even know who this is.

05:08.720 --> 05:10.632
He's killed a federal judge...

05:10.800 --> 05:13.360
...which means
he goes after high-profile targets.

05:13.520 --> 05:16.831
He left clues at your doorstep,
which means it's a game to him...

05:17.040 --> 05:20.716
<i>...one he'll keep playing
until you stop him.</i>

05:20.920 --> 05:22.513
<i>You're being baited, Elizabeth...</i>

05:22.680 --> 05:26.720
...taunted by a killer
who knows where you live.

05:52.240 --> 05:54.152
Oh, come on,
you don't think I can sing?

05:54.320 --> 05:56.118
I see you laughing at me.

06:22.240 --> 06:23.799
Hey! Stop!

06:23.960 --> 06:25.189
Stop!

06:36.680 --> 06:39.559
Hi. Hi. Hi.

06:39.720 --> 06:40.790
What are you doing? Hi.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.674
Come here, come here, come here.
I know.

06:43.880 --> 06:47.237
I got you. I got you.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.992
We've been going
through the judge's docket.

06:59.160 --> 07:02.995
Six months back, six months ahead.
There's a total of 53 cases.

07:03.160 --> 07:06.232
Seems like a revenge killing.
Retaliation for a ruling.

07:06.680 --> 07:09.514
<i>- Next one could be a witness, a lawyer.
- First a drowning.</i>

07:09.680 --> 07:11.512
<i>Then a shooting.
What's the pattern?</i>

07:11.680 --> 07:13.114
<i>The victims can't be random.</i>

07:13.280 --> 07:15.317
The clock tower,
I've been thinking about it.

07:15.480 --> 07:17.233
It's... It's familiar.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.437
And then I realized I remembered it...

07:19.600 --> 07:22.513
...from Mr. Mathiesen's
seventh-grade Civics class.

07:22.680 --> 07:26.276
- We studied all the great D.C. buildings.
- Aram. The building.

07:26.440 --> 07:29.672
- I think it's the old post office tower.
- Well, this clock says 12:30.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.837
- If that's p.m., we're in trouble.
- Alert M.P.D.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.879
Say we have intel
that a homicide is about to be attempted.

07:35.040 --> 07:37.077
I'll mobilize surveillance.
We'll take him down.

07:37.240 --> 07:39.755
He's not getting anywhere near
your place this time.

07:41.640 --> 07:43.472
Geoffroy, thank you for coming.

07:43.640 --> 07:46.553
I was surprised you called me,
Mr. Reddington.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.677
What can I do for you?

07:51.240 --> 07:53.072
Tell me about cobalt.

07:54.960 --> 07:58.556
Every cell phone battery requires
at least three grams of it.

07:58.720 --> 08:00.234
Laptops even more.

08:00.400 --> 08:04.713
I'm told Iniko's investing in cobalt mines.

08:04.920 --> 08:07.833
- I want in.
- You'd have to talk to Iniko about that.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.275
Shall I set a meeting?

08:10.520 --> 08:12.273
Do you recognize this apartment?

08:13.240 --> 08:14.720
No.

08:15.560 --> 08:16.789
Should I?

08:16.960 --> 08:19.077
It belonged to a dear friend of mine...

08:19.240 --> 08:22.199
...a former acquaintance of Iniko's.

08:22.360 --> 08:26.593
I say former because Iniko had him killed
right where you're standing.

08:27.120 --> 08:31.194
Imagine, all that blood
on this very carpet.

08:31.400 --> 08:32.674
Amazing.

08:32.840 --> 08:34.513
It's like it never happened.

08:35.039 --> 08:36.759
As if he never existed.

08:36.919 --> 08:38.320
Why are you telling me this?

08:38.480 --> 08:41.200
I'm interested in the mines...

08:41.640 --> 08:44.030
...but not in doing business with Iniko.

08:45.680 --> 08:47.672
You're asking me to betray my boss?

08:47.880 --> 08:49.473
Yes. I'm prepared to make...

08:49.640 --> 08:52.280
...a substantial contribution
to the venture.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.159
He would kill me if he found out.

08:54.840 --> 08:56.399
If he were still alive.

08:56.560 --> 08:59.359
Look, Mr. Reddington, I don't know
what you're suggesting...

08:59.520 --> 09:03.753
I'm suggesting that this is your moment,
if you're smart enough to seize it.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.912
Iniko's loyal only to himself.

09:06.080 --> 09:09.278
He suffers you because your uncle
has the ear of the president.

09:09.480 --> 09:12.632
You're a patronage hire
who buys Iniko goodwill...

09:12.800 --> 09:15.269
...with the powers that be,
but when they go...

09:15.440 --> 09:18.512
...and they will, you'll go.

09:19.760 --> 09:24.789
Like my dear friend
who bled all over this white carpet.

09:34.880 --> 09:38.920
All right, I'm tapped into every camera
in the area and I am not seeing anything.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.557
I hate bikes.

09:44.280 --> 09:47.591
- They're good for the environment.
- We can't tell which one's our perp.

09:47.760 --> 09:48.989
I got word from the lab.

09:49.160 --> 09:52.073
They were able to pull a print
from a handrail by my apartment.

09:52.240 --> 09:54.550
Matches a partial we pulled
from the first model.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.679
Suspect's name is Fiona Driscoll.

10:07.720 --> 10:10.076
Guys, we're looking for a guy
on a bike, right?

10:24.080 --> 10:26.914
I think that bike might be a motorcycle.

10:31.080 --> 10:33.436
Down! Get down!

10:45.920 --> 10:47.400
You okay?

10:47.560 --> 10:49.153
Yeah.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.070
Who the hell are you?

10:51.560 --> 10:52.596
FBI.

10:54.400 --> 10:58.713
Iniko. I understand you're in town
to bribe a congressman.

10:58.880 --> 11:02.669
Tell me, what's the going rate
to get someone to ignore rape...

11:02.840 --> 11:05.833
...slave labor, child
soldiers, child brides...

11:06.000 --> 11:09.596
I was told you had
a business proposition, not a lecture.

11:09.760 --> 11:11.797
The cobalt mines. I want in.

11:11.960 --> 11:14.236
- Not interested.
- A lecture, then.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.478
You've been betrayed
by a trusted employee.

11:17.640 --> 11:20.599
I recently experienced
a similar betrayal...

11:20.760 --> 11:22.797
...so I know that it's a bitter pill.

11:22.960 --> 11:25.953
Especially since in our line of work...

11:26.160 --> 11:29.597
...betrayal requires
swift and decisive retribution.

11:29.760 --> 11:33.276
And you will give me the name
in exchange for a cut of the mines.

11:33.440 --> 11:34.760
Twenty-five percent.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.954
Assuming you can verify
what I tell you is true.

11:38.120 --> 11:39.952
Twenty.

11:40.320 --> 11:41.549
Geoffroy Keino.

11:41.760 --> 11:45.800
He approached me about investing
in the mines if I agreed to kill you.

11:46.280 --> 11:50.513
His terms were very generous,
so you can imagine how tempted I was...

11:50.680 --> 11:52.319
...but, as I mentioned...

11:52.520 --> 11:56.275
...I have recently felt
the sting of duplicity...

11:56.480 --> 12:00.156
...and I simply couldn't bring myself
to facilitate such a betrayal...

12:00.360 --> 12:03.080
...of someone else,
even someone so loathsome.

12:04.400 --> 12:08.394
And people say
there is no honor among thieves.

12:08.720 --> 12:11.280
Stay. Have some foie gras.

12:11.440 --> 12:14.353
No, thank you.
I find it difficult to enjoy foie gras.

12:14.680 --> 12:15.909
All those poor geese.

12:16.080 --> 12:19.471
All those painfully engorged livers.

12:20.280 --> 12:23.114
In my opinion,
some lives are inconsequential.

12:23.280 --> 12:24.475
And delicious.

12:24.680 --> 12:27.718
We'll be in touch
with any further developments.

12:28.040 --> 12:30.635
- You shouldn't use her like that.
- Not here.

12:30.800 --> 12:34.111
As a story to get what you want.
It's disrespectful.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.840
Kate doesn't deserve that.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.956
Hey, it's me. We have a problem.

12:51.160 --> 12:54.153
<i>It's about Milch.
The Feds were waiting when I got there.</i>

12:54.320 --> 12:56.118
I don't know how, but they knew.

12:56.280 --> 12:57.714
<i>All right, calm down.</i>

12:57.920 --> 13:01.118
Don't talk to anybody.
I'll call my source downtown...

13:01.280 --> 13:03.351
...see what he knows.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.796
- Hello, Ms. Driscoll.
- Agent Keen.

13:07.960 --> 13:09.599
There's been a terrible mistake.

13:09.760 --> 13:11.831
We have your fingerprints
on the renderings...

13:12.000 --> 13:13.229
...you left at my home.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.676
I know what you're thinking,
I know how it looks.

13:15.840 --> 13:17.559
It looks like you were taunting Keen...

13:17.720 --> 13:21.111
...giving details of murders you'd commit
to see if she could stop you.

13:21.320 --> 13:24.074
We found traces of aconitine
in the judge's system.

13:24.280 --> 13:27.079
You poisoned her,
and then tried to murder Marlon Milch.

13:27.280 --> 13:29.033
Marlon Milch. Is that his name?

13:29.240 --> 13:32.358
You're saying you didn't know the name
of the man you tried to kill?

13:32.520 --> 13:33.556
You've got it wrong.

13:33.720 --> 13:36.315
I wasn't trying to kill them.
I was trying to save them.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.915
I left the models
because I wasn't sure what to do.

13:39.080 --> 13:42.278
Models of crime scenes made
before the crimes were committed.

13:42.440 --> 13:46.400
So how do you explain that?
Unless you're the killer.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.679
They're premonitions.

13:51.680 --> 13:52.875
Tell us about the victims.

13:53.360 --> 13:56.159
A respected judge,
a controversial businessman.

13:56.320 --> 13:58.232
Why target them?
Why are they connected?

13:58.440 --> 14:00.432
I only know what I see in the dioramas.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.193
Why haven't you told the police?

14:02.400 --> 14:05.279
I have.
They looked at me like I'm crazy.

14:05.440 --> 14:07.557
That's why I came to you, Agent Keen.

14:07.720 --> 14:10.918
I saw you at the grocery store,
recognized you from the news.

14:11.120 --> 14:14.511
I followed you home
because I thought you'd understand.

14:14.680 --> 14:18.515
The pardon. You know what it's like
to be judged harshly.

14:18.680 --> 14:21.639
How it feels not to be believed.

14:22.200 --> 14:23.839
When did these premonitions start?

14:24.920 --> 14:26.354
Just over two years ago.

14:27.360 --> 14:30.034
So there are more dioramas?

14:39.760 --> 14:44.312
At first it was butterflies with glitter
and things like that.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.119
Then they turned into...

14:46.320 --> 14:47.549
...these.

14:47.720 --> 14:52.670
There are 42 in all, each forecasting
some horrible tragedy.

14:52.840 --> 14:54.069
Murders...

14:54.400 --> 14:55.675
...accidents...

14:55.840 --> 14:57.320
...catastrophes.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.034
This is Flight 361.

15:00.680 --> 15:04.196
It crashed in the Andes last year.

15:04.360 --> 15:06.591
Sometimes they come with vivid detail.

15:06.800 --> 15:10.476
Others are more impressionistic.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.838
How do you get these visions?

15:13.320 --> 15:16.757
Oh, no, they're not mine.
I don't see them.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.600
Her name's Maggie.

15:23.040 --> 15:24.679
She's 9.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.390
Maggie's mind is...

15:35.120 --> 15:36.474
...different.

15:36.640 --> 15:40.475
She suffers from what doctors call
a constellation of birth defects.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.518
The result of fetal rubella.

15:42.680 --> 15:45.240
Heart problems, hearing impairment...

15:45.400 --> 15:47.631
...any number of developmental issues...

15:47.840 --> 15:50.753
...but I feel like she understands
more than they think.

15:50.920 --> 15:54.436
Just because she can't talk
doesn't mean she has nothing to say.

15:54.640 --> 15:56.916
Maggie's visions, when did they start?

15:57.080 --> 15:59.151
February, two years ago.

15:59.320 --> 16:02.677
She drew me a picture,
this terrible image.

16:03.040 --> 16:06.795
A train and a bus crashing,
bodies everywhere.

16:06.960 --> 16:11.034
The next day, a bus was struck
by a train in the Ukraine.

16:11.240 --> 16:13.960
Thirteen people were killed,
another six injured...

16:14.160 --> 16:15.480
...and she knew.

16:15.640 --> 16:18.917
Somehow, Maggie knew.

16:19.120 --> 16:21.271
Were there changes
in your life at the time?

16:21.440 --> 16:23.716
Had you moved?
Did she change schools?

16:23.920 --> 16:25.798
No. Nothing.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.676
We've always been around
the same close circle of friends.

16:29.880 --> 16:31.678
Our world is very small.

16:31.880 --> 16:34.520
What is she working on now?

16:35.080 --> 16:36.560
The next one.

16:39.480 --> 16:42.234
I cross-checked the dioramas
against verifiable incidents...

16:42.400 --> 16:46.633
...and in each case the incident
and the diorama were a match.

16:46.800 --> 16:50.237
This July, a sailboat washes ashore
south of Naples.

16:50.440 --> 16:53.114
Both the owner and his wife
are lost at sea.

16:53.320 --> 16:56.358
Two months earlier,
a Jaipur factory fire kills 18.

16:56.760 --> 17:00.231
A bus accident in Miami,
a mass shooting in Madrid.

17:00.400 --> 17:03.472
These aren't just crimes,
these are catastrophic events...

17:03.640 --> 17:05.154
...happening all over the world.

17:05.319 --> 17:07.357
The mother claims
the child predicted this?

17:07.520 --> 17:10.115
- That's what she says.
- I don't believe in premonitions.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.920
So prior knowledge has
to have come from somewhere.

17:13.079 --> 17:16.835
We have a list of everyone who interacts
with the child, but it's not promising.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.036
She can't speak?

17:18.200 --> 17:21.238
Her mother says she has
an undiagnosed cognitive disorder.

17:21.400 --> 17:22.435
Pull her medical file.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.790
I want to know exactly
what we can expect her...

17:24.960 --> 17:27.270
...to be able to tell us
about these premonitions.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.036
<i>- Tom.
- Hey.</i>

17:32.200 --> 17:34.874
Is everything okay?
Three FBI agents are camped outside.

17:35.040 --> 17:38.590
Cooper insisted. But the person
who left the diorama wasn't the killer.

17:38.760 --> 17:41.195
<i>It was a mom
whose daughter knows about crimes...</i>

17:41.360 --> 17:45.513
<i>- ...that haven't been committed yet.
- Okay, that's a little weird. And creepy.</i>

17:45.680 --> 17:48.400
If she knows where we live,
maybe the killer does too.

17:48.560 --> 17:49.789
Tell me about Agnes.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.596
She's blissfully unaware that her parents
are talking about a serial killer.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.314
What can I do? How can I help?

17:55.480 --> 17:56.755
You are helping.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.434
<i>You know what I mean.</i>

17:58.600 --> 18:00.751
I do. And I appreciate that.

18:00.920 --> 18:03.435
But for now we're good.

18:03.640 --> 18:05.199
I'll call you if anything changes.

18:05.360 --> 18:08.637
Sure. Okay. Go do your thing.

18:20.440 --> 18:21.874
The mining deal is closed.

18:22.040 --> 18:23.633
You sound surprised.

18:24.840 --> 18:26.115
And you look scared.

18:27.360 --> 18:30.432
Iniko completed financing
without consulting me.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.671
And now he's not returning my calls.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.951
Perhaps he has a new acolyte.

18:35.120 --> 18:37.510
Or grew wary of your ambition.

18:37.720 --> 18:39.393
I've given him no reason to be.

18:39.560 --> 18:42.917
Others might have.
People hoping to gain his trust...

18:43.080 --> 18:44.799
...by betraying you.

18:44.960 --> 18:46.792
I haven't done anything.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.475
But you're here. So you want to.

18:50.160 --> 18:51.196
If he suspects me...

18:51.400 --> 18:54.359
Oh, please, spare me
the wide-eyed innocence.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.876
You're the top aide to a man
who pays your salary...

18:57.040 --> 18:58.759
...with the lives of women and children.

18:58.920 --> 19:02.709
You're every bit as responsible
for committing atrocities as he is.

19:02.880 --> 19:03.916
Cheer up, Geoffroy.

19:04.120 --> 19:07.511
This isn't the end, it's the beginning.
Your beginning.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.831
One you need
to announce loudly enough...

19:10.040 --> 19:13.158
...to scare off
other pretenders to the throne.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.676
Might I suggest something
in broad daylight?

19:15.880 --> 19:17.553
Perhaps a nice car bombing?

19:17.760 --> 19:20.320
A cliché, I know, but clichés work.

19:20.480 --> 19:23.040
That's how they get to be clichés.

19:24.840 --> 19:28.880
Hey. I think we found something
in Maggie Driscoll's medical records.

19:29.040 --> 19:31.032
- A way for us to communicate?
- Us?

19:31.200 --> 19:34.238
Maybe. Or a killer.
She wears a hearing aid.

19:34.440 --> 19:37.638
A very tiny high-frequency model.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.632
- So?
- We've run down everyone she knows.

19:39.800 --> 19:43.680
No suspects. So maybe the killer
or killers are people she doesn't know.

19:43.840 --> 19:46.912
I think the hearing aid might be
picking up nearby conversations...

19:47.120 --> 19:49.191
...via radio frequency interference.

19:49.360 --> 19:50.635
- Conversations.
- Phone calls.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.110
Transmitted on a frequency
that bleeds into one...

19:53.280 --> 19:54.316
...her aid operates on.

19:54.480 --> 19:57.154
Which means at least one
of our suspects is close.

19:57.320 --> 19:59.755
A neighbor.
Someone in the apartment complex.

19:59.920 --> 20:01.991
Get there.
Interview everyone in the building.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.799
That could be hundreds of people.

20:03.960 --> 20:06.839
- You have a better idea?
- Actually, yeah. I might.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.276
I think I can get us a step closer yet.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.110
I'm still getting interference.

20:20.280 --> 20:21.760
Is this really gonna help?

20:21.920 --> 20:25.038
We need to unplug anything
that might cause RF interference.

20:25.240 --> 20:28.233
Lights, appliances...

20:29.560 --> 20:31.153
Sorry.

20:31.520 --> 20:33.591
Okay. Cell phones.

20:33.760 --> 20:36.673
And turn off your comms,
we gotta go with walkies.

20:36.880 --> 20:40.510
Aram, are we listening for bad guys
or are we holding a séance?

20:40.680 --> 20:43.115
That is not funny.

20:43.280 --> 20:45.317
In college,
Matt Skrdell had a Ouija board...

20:45.480 --> 20:48.791
...and we actually made contact
with my pet rabbit, Dash...

20:48.960 --> 20:50.110
...God rest her soul...

20:50.280 --> 20:55.275
...and it turns out she did not escape
from her cage like I was told.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.357
<i>...Has to happen sooner.</i>

22:14.560 --> 22:17.075
<i>- In the tower, as discussed.
- Aram, where are they?</i>

22:17.240 --> 22:20.119
<i>We couldn't finish Milch
and you're talking about the nextjob?</i>

22:20.280 --> 22:21.600
<i>What have you found out?</i>

22:21.760 --> 22:24.878
<i>I said I'd get back to you
when I know more. Stick to the plan.</i>

22:26.800 --> 22:28.553
Did we lose them?

22:31.680 --> 22:33.353
For now.

22:36.640 --> 22:37.790
But they're out there...

22:38.240 --> 22:39.640
...very close.

22:42.080 --> 22:43.309
And next time they call...

22:45.440 --> 22:47.352
...we're gonna find them.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.190
I don't know whether
to be relieved or terrified.

22:54.360 --> 22:56.591
Thanks to you,
I know how it's happening, but...

22:57.160 --> 22:59.880
...it's only happening
because these people...

23:00.040 --> 23:01.394
...these killers live nearby.

23:01.560 --> 23:04.029
How much of it do you think
she actually understands?

23:04.200 --> 23:05.600
Too much, I'm afraid.

23:05.760 --> 23:08.753
That's why she does it.
She knows they have to be stopped.

23:09.800 --> 23:11.678
<i>A kid? That's ridiculous.</i>

23:11.840 --> 23:14.560
<i>- We're live.
- Not according to my source downtown.</i>

23:14.720 --> 23:17.155
<i>Her mother told the cops
about her six months ago.</i>

23:17.320 --> 23:21.360
<i>They ignored her
so she must've gone to the FBI.</i>

23:21.520 --> 23:25.673
<i>She was able to give them the time
and location of the Milch assignment.</i>

23:25.880 --> 23:27.280
<i>You're saying she's listening?</i>

23:27.440 --> 23:28.999
<i>Watching?</i>

23:29.160 --> 23:30.389
How is that possible?

23:30.560 --> 23:33.029
I don't know. The investors are upset.

23:33.200 --> 23:35.032
If we lose another offering...

23:35.200 --> 23:37.874
Look, she's a threat
that needs to be dealt with.

23:38.040 --> 23:40.794
Signal strength is S3.
We are very close.

23:41.360 --> 23:43.317
Get me a name.

23:43.520 --> 23:45.557
I'll handle the kid.

23:47.160 --> 23:49.914
Fifth floor. Fourth apartment
from the end. East wing.

24:08.160 --> 24:09.230
It's okay. It's okay.

24:10.440 --> 24:12.193
You are gonna be okay, all right?

24:12.360 --> 24:14.352
Officers are gonna be here any minute.

24:14.520 --> 24:15.556
FBI!

24:17.600 --> 24:19.319
- Clear.
- How did we miss him?

24:24.880 --> 24:29.557
Aram, issue an alert. White male.
Dark hair, about 5'10".

24:29.720 --> 24:32.235
We need units covering every way
in and out of here.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.036
Aram?

24:35.400 --> 24:36.754
Aram's down.

24:36.920 --> 24:38.991
We're gonna need an ambulance.

24:40.640 --> 24:43.678
<i>All units, please be advised,
we have a federal agent down.</i>

24:51.520 --> 24:52.556
I had to disarm him.

24:52.760 --> 24:55.070
Are you playing me?
Is this some sick joke to you?

24:55.240 --> 24:57.311
Okay, calm down.
Tell me what happened.

24:57.480 --> 24:59.790
He found it. The car bomb.

24:59.960 --> 25:02.270
It was as if his security detail
knew where to look.

25:02.440 --> 25:04.272
- You think I told him?
- No one else knew.

25:04.480 --> 25:07.314
Except the munitions expert
who made the bomb...

25:07.520 --> 25:09.193
...the mechanic who installed it.

25:09.400 --> 25:13.440
You were sloppy
and you're looking for someone to blame.

25:13.800 --> 25:16.599
- Blame yourself.
- If I go home...

25:17.320 --> 25:19.596
- ...I'm a dead man.
- Then don't go home.

25:19.760 --> 25:23.310
Iniko may not be taking your calls,
but he will certainly take mine.

25:23.480 --> 25:26.154
I told you,
the deal on the mine is closed.

25:26.320 --> 25:28.437
There's always another deal.

25:28.600 --> 25:33.914
I have one in mind that I know
he will find especially hard to resist.

25:34.080 --> 25:39.758
Relax. Have a drink.
Help me finish this infuriating puzzle.

25:40.120 --> 25:42.351
And when Iniko does come...

25:42.560 --> 25:45.234
...you'll be waiting with a magic bullet.

25:46.720 --> 25:49.394
Aram, talk to me!
You didn't see which way they went?

25:51.960 --> 25:55.476
I didn't, no, but M.P.D. says we have
two officers down in the building.

25:55.640 --> 25:57.711
<i>One was stripped,
missing his gun, his badge.</i>

25:57.880 --> 25:59.394
Our guy's in uniform. Great.

26:09.400 --> 26:10.754
She's gotta be close.

26:13.360 --> 26:15.556
We could call out to her
if she could hear us.

26:16.800 --> 26:18.678
<i>- Maybe she can.
- How?</i>

26:18.840 --> 26:22.038
<i>Police radios operate on an RF
frequency like her hearing device...</i>

26:22.200 --> 26:23.714
<i>...which can cause interference.</i>

26:23.880 --> 26:26.475
<i>Go to frequency 154.400 and turn it up.</i>

26:28.320 --> 26:30.152
Turn it all the way up.

26:32.120 --> 26:33.793
What's wrong with you? Get up!

26:42.600 --> 26:43.636
Turn it down.

26:43.800 --> 26:46.190
The officer that was with her,
has anybody seen him?

26:58.120 --> 26:59.759
I can hear him.

26:59.920 --> 27:01.149
He's in there.

27:01.640 --> 27:03.871
Use this. It's untraceable.

27:08.120 --> 27:10.191
Would you ever do this?

27:10.880 --> 27:12.519
Betray your own boss?

27:17.800 --> 27:19.632
I don't know.

27:22.920 --> 27:24.718
Geoffroy, what are you doing here?

27:26.360 --> 27:28.431
Unfinished business, I'm afraid.

27:32.080 --> 27:33.753
What the hell...?

27:35.880 --> 27:37.234
You set me up.

27:37.400 --> 27:39.551
Reddington. It was his idea!

27:39.760 --> 27:41.991
Actually, it was ours.

27:50.880 --> 27:52.109
I'm texting you an address.

27:53.560 --> 27:55.199
My cleanup crew.

27:57.040 --> 28:00.078
I once bankrolled a diamond mine
outside Tshikapa.

28:01.200 --> 28:04.034
One day a man showed up,
alone, unarmed...

28:04.240 --> 28:07.392
...and started to talk to me
about the mine.

28:07.560 --> 28:09.199
I had guns and guards...

28:09.360 --> 28:15.118
...and an enterprise worth,
I don't know, 50, 150 million dollars.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.909
He had nothing but a story...

28:19.040 --> 28:24.035
...about greed
driving atrocities and conflict.

28:24.200 --> 28:28.877
About armed groups using mass rape
and mutilation...

28:29.040 --> 28:33.876
...as a means to control people
in the villages around the mines.

28:34.440 --> 28:38.116
I had bullets. He had words.

28:39.480 --> 28:42.154
But when he was done talking...

28:42.720 --> 28:48.318
...for the first time I truly understood
which of those was more powerful.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.831
I abandoned the mine...

28:51.040 --> 28:56.240
...agreed to finance his campaign
of protection and protest...

28:56.400 --> 28:59.154
...and did so until two months ago...

28:59.320 --> 29:00.993
...when you had him murdered.

29:02.840 --> 29:04.593
Cyrus Choi.

29:07.320 --> 29:08.356
Yeah.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.151
He was a good man...

29:18.800 --> 29:20.792
...and my friend.

29:26.000 --> 29:29.835
And somehow your cleaners removed
even the memory...

29:30.000 --> 29:32.595
...of his blood from this carpet.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.957
They're the best in the business.

29:36.280 --> 29:37.714
They better be.

29:38.800 --> 29:41.269
They're gonna have a lot to clean up.

29:50.800 --> 29:52.393
The girl's with paramedics now.

29:52.600 --> 29:54.831
She'll be fine.
What do we know about our runner?

29:55.000 --> 29:57.834
Benjamin Allen Charnquist, 35.
He went to Berkeley.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.879
He was kicked out junior year
after being convicted of rape.

30:01.040 --> 30:03.077
<i>- He went to San Quentin.
- When did he get out?</i>

30:03.280 --> 30:06.796
2002. He's been off the radar ever since.
Now we know why.

30:06.960 --> 30:10.158
Guys, check this out.

30:10.320 --> 30:13.313
We couldn't see it from the dioramas,
but there is a pattern.

30:13.480 --> 30:18.760
The factory fire in Jaipur tanked the stock
of the Zardozi Imports company.

30:18.960 --> 30:22.271
The man and his wife who vanished
off the coast of Naples in their boat?

30:22.440 --> 30:24.671
<i>He was the CEO
of a Silicon Valley tech firm.</i>

30:24.880 --> 30:28.112
The company lost a quarter of its value
after he disappeared.

30:28.280 --> 30:32.832
Culpepper was set to rule against OJN
Global in a patent infringement case...

30:33.000 --> 30:36.277
...and Marlon Milch is the CEO
of a Fortune 500 company.

30:36.480 --> 30:37.800
Each of these catastrophes...

30:37.960 --> 30:41.271
...involved someone who was invaluable
to the company they worked for...

30:41.480 --> 30:44.154
...and their deaths dramatically affected
the stock prices.

30:44.360 --> 30:47.717
So maybe the motive is profit. Maybe
Charnquist was shorting the stocks.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.872
He's a college dropout
with a felony record.

30:50.040 --> 30:53.158
- I doubt he came up with it on his own.
- The guy he talked to.

30:53.320 --> 30:56.040
At his parole hearing,
three people testified on his behalf:

30:56.200 --> 30:58.556
His parents and the CEO
of the private equity firm...

30:58.720 --> 31:01.315
...he interned at in college:
Chris Farnsworth.

31:01.480 --> 31:02.994
CEO of Jasek Financial.

31:03.160 --> 31:06.756
Just because Farnsworth testified,
what makes you think he's involved?

31:06.920 --> 31:09.799
According to SEC filings,
Farnsworth's company made a fortune...

31:09.960 --> 31:13.112
...after each and every person
Aram mentioned were murdered.

31:13.280 --> 31:16.717
Once or twice is luck.
This many times is a conspiracy.

31:16.880 --> 31:18.712
Get a TAC team to Jasek Financial now.

31:18.880 --> 31:20.678
<i>We heard them talk about another job...</i>

31:20.840 --> 31:23.116
...but we don't know where
and we don't know when.

31:23.280 --> 31:25.431
No, but we know someone who does.

31:26.680 --> 31:29.639
They know everything.
I've got Feds swarming my place.

31:29.800 --> 31:31.439
Calm down. Stick to the plan.

31:31.600 --> 31:34.593
<i>Calm down?
They have my files. Every trade.</i>

31:34.760 --> 31:36.114
I'm going to jail.

31:36.280 --> 31:38.511
Ben, we've forecasted
how many transactions?

31:38.680 --> 31:41.240
We knew this day would
eventually come, that it'd end.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.756
<i>- Now, the plan is...
- They have the girl.</i>

31:43.960 --> 31:45.519
Yes. And they know about you.

31:45.680 --> 31:48.832
How long before they connect us?
The company?

31:49.000 --> 31:51.879
When they do, my face will be on
every network within the hour.

31:52.040 --> 31:55.351
Shares of Jasek Financial will crater.
We'll have our golden parachute.

31:55.520 --> 31:57.159
It's the escape we've discussed
since day one.

31:57.320 --> 31:59.437
<i>- And Beckner?
- Beckner is the only loose end.</i>

31:59.640 --> 32:00.835
I just hung up with him.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.152
He placed the short against Jasek
through the shell 20 minutes ago.

32:04.320 --> 32:07.472
- We gotta see this through.
- Why don't we put a bullet in his head?

32:07.640 --> 32:10.360
<i>Because a bullet brings
unwanted attention.</i>

32:10.520 --> 32:13.672
Ends up with FinCEN looking through
all of Beckner's transactions...

32:13.840 --> 32:15.240
<i>...which could point to us.</i>

32:15.400 --> 32:17.278
No, it has to look like an accident.

32:17.440 --> 32:19.511
<i>Only he knows where
our funds are routed.</i>

32:19.680 --> 32:22.832
If he's dead, we're ghosts. Rich ghosts.
Finish him. See you at the plane.

32:23.040 --> 32:26.078
Wait. You can't go in there!

32:39.560 --> 32:41.199
No. No, no.

32:41.360 --> 32:42.874
You can't ask for her help.

32:43.040 --> 32:44.520
Not after what happened.

32:44.680 --> 32:47.354
- I wish we didn't have to.
- This is what I wanted to avoid.

32:47.520 --> 32:51.275
I brought you her dioramas anonymously
to prevent her being involved.

32:51.440 --> 32:53.352
If we're gonna catch this person...

32:53.520 --> 32:54.920
...we'll need Maggie's help.

32:55.080 --> 32:58.232
Just because she can't express feelings
doesn't mean she doesn't have them.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.437
She's terrified.

33:04.760 --> 33:06.672
And determined.

33:06.880 --> 33:08.280
Cobalt.

33:08.440 --> 33:10.796
Cassiterite. Wolframite.

33:10.960 --> 33:13.429
They are the diamonds of tomorrow.

33:13.600 --> 33:16.672
Let me go and you can have
a piece of all of them.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.639
A piece of the mines.

33:20.080 --> 33:22.640
Think of the money you will make.

33:22.800 --> 33:24.553
On the backs of children.

33:24.720 --> 33:28.509
Given enough money to eat,
but not enough to ever leave.

33:28.680 --> 33:30.194
Cyrus would be disappointed.

33:30.400 --> 33:32.710
I worked in the mines. I got out.

33:32.880 --> 33:36.430
And instead of helping those
who suffer as you once did...

33:36.600 --> 33:38.000
...you profit off them.

33:38.200 --> 33:41.272
I'm a bad man, Iniko. But not that bad.

33:42.600 --> 33:44.717
Your cleaners. What are their names?

33:44.880 --> 33:47.918
- Sakiya and Fudo. Why?
- I want to hire them.

33:48.080 --> 33:50.311
- They work for me.
- Not anymore.

33:55.880 --> 33:57.917
That's what this was all about.

33:58.080 --> 33:59.753
Replacing Kate.

33:59.920 --> 34:01.434
Kate is irreplaceable.

34:02.280 --> 34:03.999
To me she is.

34:07.680 --> 34:09.831
We're meeting Iniko.

34:10.440 --> 34:12.237
Iniko just met his maker.

34:16.880 --> 34:17.996
You done did him?

34:18.199 --> 34:20.112
I did done do.

34:21.600 --> 34:25.355
- Sweet. Guy was a straight-up tool.
- This place looks familiar.

34:25.520 --> 34:27.795
It should.
You cleaned it two months ago.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.514
A friend of mine. Shot six times.

34:30.679 --> 34:33.195
Five liters of blood on this carpet.

34:33.360 --> 34:35.750
After you were done, not a drop.

34:35.920 --> 34:37.797
- You're Raymond Reddington.
- Yes.

34:37.960 --> 34:40.190
And this is my associate, Dembe Zuma.

34:40.360 --> 34:43.273
Well, aren't you a tall drink
of chocolate milk?

34:43.440 --> 34:44.998
I'd like you to work for me.

34:45.360 --> 34:47.795
Whatever Iniko was paying you,
I'll double it.

34:47.960 --> 34:49.553
So you know, we only moonlight.

34:50.239 --> 34:52.880
- A day job. How old-fashioned.
- Not really.

34:53.040 --> 34:55.350
We're crime scene cleaners
for Metro P.D.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.671
Well, won't this be fun?

35:02.680 --> 35:04.194
Jasek. Keen.

35:04.360 --> 35:06.079
What's that?
What does that mean?

35:06.240 --> 35:08.516
We know what
his next target's gonna be. Aram.

35:09.240 --> 35:11.550
Farnsworth is gonna hit
his own company.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.954
The trade cleared. Funds will be wired
to the Panama account.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.316
Agent Ressler, I think I have something.

35:24.480 --> 35:27.234
A way Charnquist may be planning
to access the building.

35:27.400 --> 35:30.438
Surveillance imagery shows
an engine room on the roof.

35:30.600 --> 35:32.114
<i>- It's connected to...
- An elevator.</i>

35:32.280 --> 35:33.999
<i>- How'd you know?
- Because of the girl.</i>

35:34.160 --> 35:36.914
Her dioramas focus on how
the crime is going to be committed.

35:37.080 --> 35:38.434
<i>This one featured an elevator.</i>

35:38.600 --> 35:41.718
Okay, the one in this building
is a Westbrook freight.

35:41.880 --> 35:43.678
<i>Built in 1922.</i>

35:44.600 --> 35:48.230
- That's before pneumatic fail-safes.
- They're gonna crash the elevator.

35:48.920 --> 35:50.240
<i>- Got him.
- Security. This is Bobby.</i>

35:50.400 --> 35:52.198
This is FBI Assistant Director Cooper.

35:52.360 --> 35:55.194
We have intel that an employee
in the building is in danger.

35:55.360 --> 35:58.194
<i>I need you to shut down everything.
Nobody in or out.</i>

35:58.360 --> 36:00.113
<i>Metro P.D. and FBI agents
are on the way.</i>

36:01.440 --> 36:03.557
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

36:03.760 --> 36:05.592
Charnquist is in the building.
Get Con Ed on the line.

36:05.760 --> 36:07.035
<i>Cut the power.
Lock up that elevator.</i>

36:07.200 --> 36:08.839
I know I have a lot of bad news today...

36:09.000 --> 36:11.560
...but the system shows
there's a backup generator.

37:07.200 --> 37:10.079
- What the hell is going on?
- Get Ressler on the horn now.

37:13.040 --> 37:14.713
He's not answering.

37:35.440 --> 37:38.000
The stop!
Where's the emergency stop?

37:55.440 --> 37:58.239
Incredible. Truly incredible.

37:58.400 --> 38:00.119
What happened to your last cleaner?

38:00.280 --> 38:01.714
She was murdered.

38:02.240 --> 38:03.469
I'm so sorry.

38:03.640 --> 38:05.393
- Were you close?
- Yes.

38:05.560 --> 38:07.119
Not a speck to be found.

38:07.280 --> 38:09.317
- Have you caught the killer?
- No.

38:09.480 --> 38:11.915
Clean as a whistle. Clean as a whistle.

38:12.080 --> 38:13.400
Do you know who he is?

38:14.040 --> 38:15.474
Yes. I do.

38:15.640 --> 38:17.836
That's good.
Then it's only a matter of time.

38:22.440 --> 38:24.511
Well, this seems like a good fit.

38:24.680 --> 38:28.117
For now. Last three years haven't
been kind to people we work for.

38:28.320 --> 38:31.916
You take care, or we'll be
mopping you up with club soda.

38:32.120 --> 38:36.080
So you do use club soda. Fascinating.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.195
What was that about?

38:41.880 --> 38:46.352
I spoke with Harold. He tells me
you've had a pyrrhic victory.

38:46.520 --> 38:48.352
We lost one of the killers.

38:48.840 --> 38:51.116
- Chris Farnsworth.
- Who were those two?

38:51.720 --> 38:54.599
For years colleagues have crowed
about his rates of return...

38:54.760 --> 38:58.117
...and urged me to invest with him.
Called him the Forecaster.

38:58.560 --> 39:03.999
But as I don't believe in investing
in anything I can't control, I declined.

39:05.720 --> 39:08.315
I know you've been concerned
about me...

39:08.480 --> 39:10.949
...about a killer knowing where I live.

39:11.160 --> 39:13.914
I wanted you to know you've got
nothing to worry about anymore.

39:16.200 --> 39:17.680
May I see your new apartment?

39:19.040 --> 39:20.679
Not yet.

39:25.240 --> 39:27.311
Maybe someday.

39:38.640 --> 39:41.678
I've been working on this,
so let me know what you think.

39:41.840 --> 39:43.399
Yeah? Smells pretty good.

39:43.560 --> 39:45.677
All right, bon appétit.

39:48.200 --> 39:50.271
What is this?

39:52.640 --> 39:53.835
It's a promise.

40:03.280 --> 40:06.557
I lied. When I said
it wasn't a lot to give up.

40:06.960 --> 40:08.314
No.

40:08.920 --> 40:10.798
It wasn't a lie. It was a hope.

40:12.760 --> 40:13.876
I want this to work.

40:14.040 --> 40:16.874
And wondering whether that's possible
is totally natural.

40:17.040 --> 40:20.397
Right, but what isn't natural,
for me, anyway...

40:20.600 --> 40:23.718
...is talking about that, so...

40:23.880 --> 40:25.553
...that's my promise...

40:25.720 --> 40:30.715
...to share this doubt with you.

40:31.960 --> 40:33.713
Thank you.

40:34.320 --> 40:36.630
I threw those out this morning.

40:37.800 --> 40:39.314
Yet here they are.

40:39.840 --> 40:41.274
Good.

40:41.600 --> 40:43.273
This is exactly where they belong.

40:47.160 --> 40:48.799
David.

40:50.880 --> 40:52.553
Lucas.

40:54.360 --> 40:55.430
And Kaya.

40:59.080 --> 41:02.039
I used to be scared of those guys.

41:02.720 --> 41:03.870
Not anymore.

41:08.440 --> 41:10.033
You got it?

41:12.280 --> 41:15.478
We could use
a little peace and quiet in our lives.

41:18.240 --> 41:19.276
Dembe.

41:20.160 --> 41:21.640
Is everything okay?

41:22.200 --> 41:23.236
No.

41:25.920 --> 41:27.877
Please, come in.

41:35.720 --> 41:37.951
I'm worried about Raymond.

41:38.120 --> 41:42.956
I don't think he cares about anything
or anyone in the world right now...

41:43.120 --> 41:46.033
...other than you or Agnes.

41:47.800 --> 41:49.837
I don't recognize him.

41:50.600 --> 41:52.432
I can't reach him.

41:53.120 --> 41:54.952
And you think I can.

41:55.840 --> 41:57.638
The people at the apartment.

41:57.800 --> 41:59.553
He wouldn't tell me who they were.

42:00.200 --> 42:01.554
They're cleaners.

42:02.280 --> 42:04.158
Cleaners? What about Mr. Kaplan?

42:04.760 --> 42:07.116
It's because she helped me
fake my death, isn't it?

42:07.520 --> 42:09.716
- He's punishing her.
- He saw it as a betrayal.

42:09.920 --> 42:12.480
- So he's replacing her.
- No.

42:13.680 --> 42:16.149
He didn't replace Kate.

42:17.280 --> 42:19.078
He killed her.
