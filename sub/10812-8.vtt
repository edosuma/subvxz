{\an5}BUT WHEN I LOOKED HIM UP
ON YELP,

00:37.036 --> 00:39.164
{\an5}HE HAD ZERO REVIEWS,
AND THAT'S NOT GOOD.

00:39.247 --> 00:42.125

{\an5}- READY?

02:01.120 --> 02:02.497
{\an5}- GIVE ME SOME--
GIVE ME A CHANCE

02:02.580 --> 02:03.748
{\an5}TO GET A LITTLE BIT
OF A HEAD START.

02:03.832 --> 02:06.668
- OKAY.

02:06.751 --> 02:08.419
IT'S TOO MUCH.

02:08.502 --> 02:11.381
{\an5}- A CLASSIC GAME
OF CAT AND MOUSE.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.383
{\an5}IF BRIAN WAS AS GOOD
AS HE SAYS HE IS,

02:13.466 --> 02:16.052
{\an5}HE WAS PROBABLY TWO STEPS
AHEAD OF ME ALREADY.

02:16.135 --> 02:18.221
{\an5}BUT, LUCKILY,
I HAD A PLAN.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.306
{\an5}IF BRIAN WANTED A GOOD REVIEW
FROM ME,

02:20.390 --> 02:21.975
{\an5}IT WASN'T
GONNA BE EASY.

02:22.058 --> 02:24.227
{\an5}IT'S ONE THING FOR BRIAN
TO TRACK ONE OF ME,

02:24.310 --> 02:27.981
{\an5}BUT LET'S SEE HOW HE DOES
WITH NINE OF ME.

02:28.064 --> 02:30.233
{\an5}PRIOR TO VISITING BRIAN,
I HIRED EIGHT ACTORS

02:30.316 --> 02:32.026
{\an5}THAT LOOKED IDENTICAL
TO ME,

02:32.110 --> 02:34.737
{\an5}AND HAD THEM READY AND WAITING
IN A NEARBY HOTEL ROOM

02:34.821 --> 02:35.780
{\an5}TO BE
MY DECOYS.

02:35.864 --> 02:39.784
{\an5}YOU GUYS HAVE ONE JOB,
WHICH IS TO BE ME, RIGHT?

02:39.868 --> 02:41.870
{\an5}all: RIGHT.
- SO LOOK HOW I'M STANDING.

02:41.953 --> 02:45.248
{\an5}LOOK AT MY POSTURE.
LISTEN TO HOW I'M TALKING.

02:45.331 --> 02:45.707
{\an5}YOU GOT THAT?
all: ALL RIGHT.

02:45.790 --> 02:46.916
both: GOT IT.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.129
{\an5}- I HAVE A BIT
OF A JAW THING,

02:51.212 --> 02:56.134
{\an5}SO SOMETIMES,
I'LL GO LIKE THIS TO MY JAW.

02:56.217 --> 02:58.011
{\an5}IF BRIAN WAS WATCHING
THE HOTEL,

02:58.094 --> 03:00.263
{\an5}THIS WAS MY FIRST CHANCE
TO THROW HIM OFF...

03:03.683 --> 03:05.685
{\an5}BUT I KNEW
WHETHER HE WAS THERE OR NOT,

03:05.768 --> 03:07.437
{\an5}THE NEXT PLACE HE'D LOOK
IS MY HOUSE.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.314
{\an5}- MY UNDERSTANDING
IS THAT NATHAN'S AT HOME.

03:09.397 --> 03:11.399
{\an5}SO THAT'S WHERE WE'RE HEADED
RIGHT NOW.

03:11.482 --> 03:13.943
{\an5}- SO I KEPT THE BEST BODY DOUBLE
BACK AT THE HOTEL

03:14.027 --> 03:16.446
{\an5}TO PREPARE HIM TO GO
TO MY HOME AS ME.

03:16.529 --> 03:17.947
{\an5}SO WHEN YOU'RE THERE,
YOU KNOW,

03:18.031 --> 03:20.491
{\an5}YOU NEED
TO BE LIKE ME.

03:20.575 --> 03:21.951
- OKAY.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.995
{\an5}- SO THERE'S A BUNCH OF DISHES
IN THE SINK.

03:24.078 --> 03:25.163
{\an5}SO YOU CAN
DO THOSE.

03:25.246 --> 03:28.416
UM, THERE'S ALSO LAUNDRY,

03:28.499 --> 03:29.626
SO YOU COULD DO THAT.

03:29.709 --> 03:33.713
{\an5}UM, AND THE HOUSE NEEDS
TO BE VACUUMED.

03:33.796 --> 03:35.048
{\an5}- SO YOU WANT ME
TO CLEAN YOUR HOUSE?

03:35.131 --> 03:36.466
{\an5}- YEAH, STUFF THAT WOULD LOOK
LIKE YOU'RE ME.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.343
- OKAY.

03:38.426 --> 03:40.219
{\an5}- I GAVE HIM MY KEYS
AND MY ADDRESS,

03:40.303 --> 03:42.138
{\an5}BUT NOW
I NEEDED HIS.

03:42.221 --> 03:44.807
{\an5}- IF YOU'RE ME,
THEN WHO'S YOU, RIGHT?

03:44.891 --> 03:46.976
{\an5}SO I GOTTA BE YOU
WHILE YOU'RE BEING ME.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.645
{\an5}- WANT MY KEYS?
- GIVE ME--YEAH.

03:48.728 --> 03:49.687
{\an5}IF YOU THINK
I'M BEING UNREASONABLE,

03:49.771 --> 03:52.607
{\an5}KEEP IN MIND THAT BRIAN
IS A PROFESSIONAL P.I.

03:52.690 --> 03:55.944
{\an5}AND HE'D BE ABLE TO SNIFF OUT
ANY INCONSISTENCIES IN MY PLAN.

03:56.027 --> 03:57.153
{\an5}- DO YOU HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND?

03:57.236 --> 03:59.030
{\an5}- I HAVE A FIANCEE, YEAH.
- A FIANCEE?

03:59.113 --> 04:02.867
{\an5}- MM-HMM.
- WHAT'S HER NUMBER?

04:02.951 --> 04:04.160
{\an5}I NEED TO BE YOU
IF YOU'RE ME,

04:04.243 --> 04:04.994
{\an5}OR ELSE IT WON'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

04:05.078 --> 04:08.247
{\an5}- YOU WANT HER NUMBER?
REALLY?

04:08.331 --> 04:10.166
{\an5}- UH, YEAH.
- [clears throat]

04:10.249 --> 04:11.167
{\an5}- CAITLIN, IT WAS?
- YEAH.

04:11.250 --> 04:14.712
{\an5}- WHEN'S THE WEDDING DATE?
- NEXT YEAR.

04:14.796 --> 04:15.588
{\an5}WE STILL GOT
TO LOCK DOWN A DATE.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.173
{\an5}- YOU DON'T HAVE A DATE YET?
- NO.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.009
{\an5}- OKAY, MAYBE I'LL FIGURE
THAT OUT WITH HER.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.345
{\an5}UM...
- YOU DO THAT.

04:22.428 --> 04:23.471
- WITH DAN'S WILLINGNESS

04:23.554 --> 04:25.598
{\an5}TO INCLUDE HIS FIANCEE
IN THE OPERATION,

04:25.682 --> 04:27.850
{\an5}THE SWITCH WAS
IN FULL EFFECT.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.185
{\an5}THEN, WE LEFT
AS DISCREETLY AS POSSIBLE

04:29.269 --> 04:32.855
{\an5}AND GOT
INTO EACH OTHER'S CARS.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.232
{\an5}MY INITIAL HUNCH
WAS RIGHT.

04:34.315 --> 04:36.067
{\an5}BRIAN WAS
SECRETLY WATCHING MY HOUSE

04:36.150 --> 04:37.402
{\an5}FROM AN SUV
ACROSS THE STREET.

04:37.485 --> 04:41.572
{\an5}HOPEFULLY, MY PLAN TO GET
MY DOUBLE INSIDE WOULD WORK.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.366
{\an5}- OH, THIS COULD BE
OUR SUBJECT RIGHT NOW.

04:43.449 --> 04:44.701
{\an5}- LOOK AT THAT.
IT'S NATHAN.

04:44.784 --> 04:47.370
{\an5}HE'S PARKED ON THE NORTH SIDE
OF THE STREET.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.122
BINGO.

04:49.205 --> 04:52.291
{\an5}LOOKS LIKE HE'S CARRYING A CASE
OF BEER ON HIS LEFT SHOULDER.

04:54.585 --> 04:56.295
AMAZING.

04:56.379 --> 05:00.091
GOING TO A PARTY TONIGHT.

05:00.174 --> 05:01.509
{\an5}HE'S WALKING TO THE RESIDENCE
RIGHT NOW,

05:01.592 --> 05:03.886
{\an5}AND NOW,
HE'S OUT OF VIEW.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.013
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

05:05.096 --> 05:08.016
{\an5}- THE BEER-ON-SHOULDER TRICK
ACTUALLY FOOLED BRIAN,

05:08.099 --> 05:10.101
{\an5}BUT, AT THE TIME,
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

05:10.184 --> 05:11.561
{\an5}SO I HEADED
TO DAN'S HOUSE.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.646
{\an5}AND ON MY WAY,
I MADE A QUICK STOP.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.566
{\an5}- HI, DO YOU--
DO YOU SELL ANY CONDOMS AT ALL?

05:16.649 --> 05:17.567
- YES, SIR.

05:17.650 --> 05:18.317
{\an5}- I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN

05:18.401 --> 05:20.611
{\an5}ONCE I GOT
TO DAN'S HOUSE...

05:20.695 --> 05:22.405
{\an5}- DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
THAT'S SMALLER?

05:22.488 --> 05:24.073
{\an5}- BUT I WANTED TO BE PREPARED
FOR EVERYTHING...

05:24.157 --> 05:26.409
{\an5}- THIS IS THE SMALLEST?
- YES.

05:26.492 --> 05:27.452
- BUT WHEN I ARRIVED,

05:27.535 --> 05:30.204
{\an5}MY PLAN IMMEDIATELY STARTED
TO CRUMBLE.

05:30.288 --> 05:32.290
{\an5}- HEY.
both: HI.

05:32.373 --> 05:34.792
{\an5}- HE LEFT ME A MESSAGE
THAT SOMEONE WAS COMING OVER,

05:34.876 --> 05:37.128
{\an5}BUT I WASN'T
EXPECTING ALL THIS.

05:37.211 --> 05:41.132
{\an5}BABE, UM, SO THIS GUY
SHOWED UP,

05:41.215 --> 05:43.259
{\an5}AND HE KEEPS
CALLING HIMSELF "DAN,"

05:43.342 --> 05:46.346
{\an5}AND HE BROUGHT ME FLOWERS
AND SOME MALBEC.

05:46.429 --> 05:48.139
{\an5}- DAN'S FIANCEE
WAS CREEPED OUT BY ME,

05:48.222 --> 05:49.474
{\an5}AND I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

05:49.557 --> 05:52.435
{\an5}- I MEAN, I'D FEEL BETTER
IF YOU, YOU KNOW, LEFT.

05:52.518 --> 05:55.104
{\an5}AND THEN, WHEN DAN GETS BACK,
YOU CAN COME BACK.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.482
{\an5}- MY WHOLE PLAN
WAS FALLING APART.

05:57.565 --> 06:03.112
{\an5}I WAS TIRED, AND I HAD NOTHING
LEFT TO DO BUT GIVE UP.

06:05.490 --> 06:06.866
{\an5}- NATHAN.
- HEY.

06:06.949 --> 06:08.284
- HOW ARE YOU DOING?

06:08.367 --> 06:10.912
{\an5}- ALL RIGHT, I GIVE UP.
YOU GOT ME.

06:10.995 --> 06:12.830
{\an5}YOU'RE PLAYING MIND GAMES.
I CAN'T KEEP UP.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.415
- YOU'RE AN EASY PREY, KID.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.250
{\an5}- WELL, YOU'RE THE--YOU'RE
A PRO, SO WHAT CAN I SAY?

06:16.334 --> 06:17.335
- THANK YOU.

06:17.418 --> 06:19.796
{\an5}- DO YOU WANNA GO GRAB A BEER
OR SOMETHING?

06:19.879 --> 06:20.922
{\an5}I KNOW A GREAT PLACE
DOWN THE BLOCK.

06:21.005 --> 06:22.256
{\an5}- LET'S DO IT, JUMP IN.
- DO YOU WANNA?

06:22.340 --> 06:23.674
{\an5}- YEAH, LET'S GO.
COME ON.

06:23.758 --> 06:26.844
- OKAY.

06:40.108 --> 06:42.652
{\an5}- WHO THE [bleep]
ARE YOU?

06:42.735 --> 06:43.319
{\an5}- WHAT?
- YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID.

06:43.402 --> 06:44.362
{\an5}WHO THE [bleep]
ARE YOU?

06:44.445 --> 06:47.156
{\an5}- I'M NATHAN.
- YOU'RE NOT NATHAN.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.742
{\an5}- I JUST TALKED TO YOU
THREE SECONDS AGO.

06:49.826 --> 06:50.910
{\an5}- YOU KNOW WHAT?
ENOUGH SHENANIGANS.

06:50.993 --> 06:53.204
{\an5}GET THE [bleep] OUT
OF MY TRUCK <i> NOW.</i>

06:53.287 --> 06:55.289
{\an5}- "I LEARNED AN IMPORTANT LESSON
THAT DAY--

06:55.373 --> 06:56.749
{\an5}"THAT NO MATTER
WHERE I WAS

06:56.833 --> 06:58.126
{\an5}OR HOW LONG I STAYED
IN ONE PLACE..."

06:58.209 --> 06:59.877
{\an5}- WHAT ARE YOU, [bleep]?
GET OUT!

06:59.961 --> 07:01.003
- "I'D ALWAYS BE RUNNING.

07:01.087 --> 07:04.465
{\an5}"I'D ALWAYS HAVE NO HOME
WHILE BRIAN HUNTED ME DOWN.

07:04.549 --> 07:07.844
{\an5}"BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
I LEARNED OF ALL

07:07.927 --> 07:09.345
"IS THAT BRIAN S. WOLFE

07:09.428 --> 07:12.723
{\an5}"IS AN AMAZING

07:12.807 --> 07:14.183

07:21.065 --> 07:23.359
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:23.442 --> 07:24.986
THAT'S YOUR OPINION.

07:25.069 --> 07:26.320
{\an5}TYPICALLY, I GET
FIVE STARS.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.322
{\an5}- WELL, TYPICALLY,
YOU HAVE NO REVIEWS.

07:28.406 --> 07:31.075
{\an5}- I DON'T GIVE A FLYING [bleep]
ABOUT YELP, OKAY?

07:31.159 --> 07:32.910
{\an5}I OUGHT TO DO
A BACKGROUND CHECK ON YOU,

07:32.994 --> 07:34.203
{\an5}SEE WHAT TYPE OF FELLOW
YOU ARE.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.204
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE?

07:35.288 --> 07:36.873
{\an5}YOU REMIND ME
OF THE WIZARD OF LONELINESS

07:36.956 --> 07:40.376
{\an5}'CAUSE YOU YOUR OWN SELF,
YOUR OWN WIZARD.

07:40.459 --> 07:42.461
{\an5}THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.
[laughs]

07:42.545 --> 07:44.714
{\an5}LOOK AT YOU IN A [bleep]
PINK SHIRT AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

07:44.797 --> 07:47.425
{\an5}OH, YOU'RE KILLING ME.
YOU--YOU HAVE NO FRIENDS.

07:47.508 --> 07:49.552
{\an5}THAT'S WHY YOU'RE
THE WIZARD OF LONELINESS.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.892
{\an5}- EARLIER THIS SEASON,
I FAKED A DATING SHOW

07:55.975 --> 07:58.060
{\an5}TO HELP ME OVERCOME
MY FEAR OF WOMEN,

07:58.144 --> 07:59.270
AND IT GOT ME THINKING--

07:59.353 --> 08:02.523
{\an5}MAYBE I COULD USE THIS STRATEGY
TO HELP SOMEONE ELSE.

08:02.607 --> 08:05.359
{\an5}ONE OF THE GUYS THAT WORKS
ON MY SHOW BEHIND THE SCENES,

08:05.443 --> 08:07.528
{\an5}SOLOMON, IS A QUIET,
HARD WORKER,

08:07.612 --> 08:08.571
{\an5}BUT HE REMINDED ME
A LOT OF MYSELF.

08:08.654 --> 08:11.741
{\an5}AND OVER THE COURSE
OF THE SEASON, WE BONDED.

08:11.824 --> 08:13.409
{\an5}- WELL, I LIKE
THE MOVIE <i> CLICK.</i>

08:13.492 --> 08:15.244
{\an5}- WITH ADAM SANDLER?
- YES, WITH ADAM SANDLER.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.705
{\an5}- THAT'S FUNNY.
- [chuckles]

08:17.788 --> 08:20.249
{\an5}- WHEN I FOUND OUT HE HAD ISSUES
WITH WOMEN AS WELL...

08:20.333 --> 08:21.292
{\an5}DO YOU HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND?

08:21.375 --> 08:23.461
- UH, AT THIS TIME, NO.

08:23.544 --> 08:25.671
{\an5}- I DECIDED TO HELP HIM OUT
BY SETTING HIM UP

08:25.755 --> 08:28.007
{\an5}ON A BLIND DATE
AS PART OF MY SHOW.

08:28.090 --> 08:31.928
{\an5}I WANNA SET YOU UP
ON A BLIND DATE.

08:32.010 --> 08:32.929
- THAT--THAT'S GOOD.

08:33.011 --> 08:35.765
{\an5}- YOU DON'T SEEM THAT EXCITED.
- NO, I-I AM.

08:35.847 --> 08:37.475
{\an5}- NO, WELL--
SHOW IT ON YOUR FACE, THEN.

08:37.558 --> 08:40.019
{\an5}- UH, EXCITEMENT?
- YEAH.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.895
- YES, I'M EXCITED!

08:41.979 --> 08:43.481
{\an5}- OH, GREAT.
YOU LOOK EXCITED.

08:43.563 --> 08:45.608
{\an5}- YES, YES, I AM.
- GREAT.

08:45.691 --> 08:47.902
{\an5}- BUT WHEN I PITCHED THE IDEA
TO COMEDY CENTRAL,

08:47.985 --> 08:50.446
{\an5}ALL THEY SAW WAS AN OPPORTUNITY
TO CASH IN.

08:50.529 --> 08:53.991
{\an5}- THERE'S A CATCH.
- WHAT'S THE CATCH?

08:54.075 --> 08:58.913
{\an5}- ONE OF THE SPONSORS
OF THE SHOW IS QUIZNOS.

08:58.996 --> 09:00.706
{\an5}UM, THIS ISN'T
A JOKE,

09:00.790 --> 09:03.751
{\an5}BUT THEY ARE MAKING US
DO THIS

09:03.834 --> 09:05.920
{\an5}AT ONE
OF THEIR RESTAURANTS.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.129
- OKAY.

09:07.213 --> 09:10.549
{\an5}- SO WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO DO YOUR DATE

09:10.633 --> 09:11.968
AT A QUIZNOS?

09:12.051 --> 09:13.594
{\an5}- [stammers]
IT'S OKAY.

09:13.678 --> 09:14.303
{\an5}THE QUIZNOS
IS GOOD.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.305
{\an5}- SOLOMON TOOK
THE NEWS WELL,

09:16.389 --> 09:17.473
{\an5}AND EVEN THOUGH
I WASN'T THRILLED

09:17.557 --> 09:19.392
{\an5}WITH HAVING PRODUCT PLACEMENT
IN MY SHOW,

09:19.475 --> 09:21.644
{\an5}WE'LL SEE SOLOMON'S DATE
IN A BIT.

09:21.727 --> 09:25.064
{\an5}BUT FIRST,
WHEN I GET INTO A TAXICAB,

09:25.147 --> 09:26.315
{\an5}ALL I HOPE FOR
IS A NICE, QUIET RIDE...

09:26.399 --> 09:28.901
{\an5}LEXINGTON
AND WILSHIRE, PLEASE.

09:28.985 --> 09:32.863
{\an8}BUT THERE REALLY IS NO EASY WAY
TO ASK FOR THAT.

09:32.947 --> 09:35.992
{\an8}UH, NATHAN.

09:36.075 --> 09:38.327
{\an8}UM, SORRY,

09:38.411 --> 09:39.704
{\an5}I DON'T REALLY WANNA HAVE
A CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW.

09:39.787 --> 09:43.124
{\an5}IT'S ALWAYS BEEN
AN AWKWARD SITUATION FOR ME.

09:43.207 --> 09:44.667
{\an5}THAT'S WHY I DEVISED
A SOLUTION AND BROUGHT IT

09:44.750 --> 09:49.005
{\an5}TO STRUGGLING LOS ANGELES
TAXI COMPANY INDEPENDENT CAB,

09:49.088 --> 09:50.464
{\an5}WHERE I MET WITH PRESIDENT
NETTABI AHMED.

09:50.548 --> 09:53.342
{\an5}ALL I'M SUGGESTING
IS YOU MAKE IT EASY

09:53.426 --> 09:55.845
{\an5}FOR THE CUSTOMER
TO DECIDE

09:55.928 --> 09:57.430
{\an5}IF HE WANTS A CONVERSATION
OR NOT

09:57.513 --> 09:59.390
{\an5}AND EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS
TO TALK ABOUT.

09:59.473 --> 10:01.267
{\an5}- BUT YOU CANNOT
ASK SOMEBODY,

10:01.350 --> 10:03.394
{\an5}"DO YOU HAVE--DO YOU WANNA HAVE
A CONVERSATION OR NOT?"

10:03.477 --> 10:05.521
{\an5}- UNTIL NOW.
THE PLAN--

10:05.604 --> 10:07.982
{\an5}A TOUCH SCREEN SYSTEM
THAT WILL ALLOW THE CUSTOMER

10:08.065 --> 10:09.984
{\an5}TO DISCREETLY COMMUNICATE
TO THE DRIVER

10:10.067 --> 10:12.069
{\an5}WHETHER OR NOT
HE WANTS A CONVERSATION.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.863
{\an5}AND IF HE DOES,
HE'LL ACTUALLY BE ABLE

10:13.946 --> 10:16.365
{\an5}TO SELECT THE TOPIC
HE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT.

10:16.449 --> 10:17.908
{\an5}- THE IDEA,
I ACCEPT IT RIGHT NOW,

10:17.992 --> 10:18.784
{\an5}BUT I NEED
TO TEST IT,

10:18.868 --> 10:22.121
{\an5}NOT--NOT ONLY
FOR YOUR DOCUMENTARY

10:22.204 --> 10:24.957
{\an5}OR FOR YOUR MOVIE,
BUT FOR THE BUSINESS ITSELF.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.375
{\an5}- BEFORE COMMITTING
TO ANYTHING,

10:26.459 --> 10:27.501
{\an5}NETTABI WANTED ME TO DO
A TRIAL RUN

10:27.585 --> 10:29.545
{\an5}WITH ONE
OF HIS DRIVERS--REUBEN.

10:29.628 --> 10:32.715
{\an5}ALONG WITH REUBEN'S HOME COUNTRY
OF ARMENIA,

10:32.798 --> 10:35.676
{\an5}I PICKED THREE MORE MAINSTREAM
CONVERSATION TOPICS

10:35.760 --> 10:36.594
{\an5}FOR CUSTOMERS
TO CHOOSE FROM

10:36.677 --> 10:38.763
{\an5}AND TOOK OUT SOME BOOKS
FROM THE LIBRARY

10:38.846 --> 10:40.598
{\an5}SO THAT REUBEN
COULD STUDY UP ON THEM.

10:40.681 --> 10:42.016
{\an5}YOU PROMISE
YOU'LL READ THESE?

10:42.099 --> 10:43.184
{\an5}- I PROMISE, YEAH.
- OKAY.

10:43.267 --> 10:44.226
{\an5}'CAUSE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.
- OKAY.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.019
{\an5}- YOU KNOW, I WANNA LOOK GOOD
FOR YOUR BOSS.

10:45.102 --> 10:47.021
- OKAY.

10:47.104 --> 10:49.065
{\an5}- AFTER GIVING REUBEN A WEEK
TO STUDY,

10:49.148 --> 10:50.816
{\an5}WE HAD OUR TOUCH SCREEN SYSTEM
INSTALLED IN HIS CAB,

10:50.900 --> 10:52.485
{\an5}AND IT WAS TIME TO GO PICK UP
SOME CUSTOMERS.

10:52.568 --> 10:54.904
{\an5}- SANTA MONICA
AND WILTON, PLEASE.

10:54.987 --> 10:55.988
- NO PROBLEM.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.740
{\an5}- SO WE'RE DOING THIS THING
WHERE YOU CAN SELECT

10:57.823 --> 11:01.410
{\an5}YOUR CONVERSATION PREFERENCES
FOR THE RIDE.

11:01.494 --> 11:04.330
SEE, YES OR NO.

11:04.413 --> 11:06.415
{\an5}- TURNS OUT A LOT OF PEOPLE
WERE LIKE ME.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.292
{\an5}NO ONE WANTED TO TALK
TO THE DRIVER.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.544
- LOVE THAT SILENCE.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.588
JUST NICE AND QUIET.

11:12.671 --> 11:13.714
{\an5}ARE YOU ENJOYING
THE SILENCE?

11:13.798 --> 11:14.924
- KIND OF.

11:15.007 --> 11:17.510
{\an5}- BUT IN ORDER TO REALLY SELL
MY IDEA TO NETTABI,

11:17.593 --> 11:19.637
{\an5}I NEEDED TO SHOW
THE CONVERSATION FEATURE

11:19.720 --> 11:21.389
WORKING WITH A CUSTOMER.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.099
- OKAY.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.226
{\an5}- UM, YOU KNOW, I JUST WONDER
WHAT CALIFORNIA--

11:25.309 --> 11:26.602
{\an5}WHAT WAS NATIVE
TO CALIFORNIA,

11:26.685 --> 11:27.812
{\an5}OR, YOU KNOW,
LIKE, DOLPHINS, OR--

11:27.895 --> 11:32.108
{\an5}- WHICH WHALES ARE NATIVE?
- YEAH, THAT--THAT'D BE RIGHT.

11:32.191 --> 11:33.818
{\an5}- WHICH WHALES
ARE NATIVE TO CALIFORNIA?

11:33.901 --> 11:37.279
{\an5}- CALIFORNIA.
- YEAH.

11:37.363 --> 11:38.697
{\an5}- I CANNOT ASK.
I'M SORRY.

11:38.781 --> 11:43.411
{\an5}- BUT THAT WAS COVERED IN THE--
IN THE BOOKS.

11:44.870 --> 11:45.579
{\an5}DID YOU READ--
DID YOU READ THE BOOKS?

11:45.663 --> 11:50.042
{\an5}- NO.
- YOU DIDN'T READ THEM?

11:50.126 --> 11:51.419
OKAY.

11:51.502 --> 11:53.587
{\an5}I WAS STUNNED THAT REUBEN
HADN'T PREPARED.

11:53.671 --> 11:54.422
{\an5}AND IF HE COULDN'T TALK
ABOUT WHALES,

11:54.505 --> 11:57.299
{\an5}NETTABI WOULD NEVER GO
FOR MY IDEA.

11:57.383 --> 11:58.926
{\an5}SO I ASKED HIM
TO PULL OVER

11:59.009 --> 12:02.054
{\an5}AND HAD THE CUSTOMER
WAIT OUTSIDE SO WE COULD TALK.

12:02.138 --> 12:05.975
WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:06.058 --> 12:09.019
{\an5}YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT WHALES?

12:12.523 --> 12:13.649
REUBEN KNEW NOTHING,

12:13.732 --> 12:16.569
{\an5}AND IN A LAST-DITCH EFFORT,
I PULLED UP SOME WHALE FACTS

12:16.652 --> 12:17.653
{\an5}ON MY PHONE
FOR HIM TO MEMORIZE.

12:17.736 --> 12:20.197
{\an5}A SPERM WHALE
CAN HOLD ITS BREATH

12:20.281 --> 12:21.449
FOR AT LEAST ONE HOUR.

12:21.532 --> 12:23.534
{\an5}- ONE HOUR, IT CAN HOLD--
- HOLD ITS BREATH, SPERM WHALE.

12:23.617 --> 12:24.535
{\an5}OKAY.
- SPERM WHALE.

12:24.618 --> 12:26.912
{\an5}- I GAVE REUBEN
ABOUT 15 WHALE FACTS,

12:26.996 --> 12:28.539
{\an5}AND THEN, IT WAS TIME
TO BRING THE CUSTOMER BACK IN.

12:28.622 --> 12:29.748
{\an5}- OKAY, GOT IT?
- YEAH.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.543
{\an5}- OKAY, READY?
I'M GONNA BRING HER BACK IN.

12:32.626 --> 12:37.506
{\an5}- YEAH.
- OKAY, DON'T--DON'T MESS IT UP.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.842
{\an5}both: OKAY.
- IT ALL CAME DOWN TO THIS.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.719
{\an5}THE FATE OF MY CONCEPT
WAS IN REUBEN'S HANDS.

12:41.802 --> 12:44.472
{\an5}SO ARE YOU--
YOU WERE ASKING ABOUT WHALES?

12:44.555 --> 12:45.639
{\an5}- YES.
- OKAY.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.725
SO, UM...

12:47.808 --> 12:51.061
{\an5}- IT'S A--
VERY INTERESTING ANIMALS.

12:51.145 --> 12:53.731
{\an8}UH, FOR EXAMPLE...

12:53.814 --> 12:57.860
{\an8}IT CAN HOLD THE BREATH
UNDERWATER FOR ONE HOUR.

12:57.943 --> 12:58.694
- WHAT ELSE?

12:58.777 --> 13:03.199
{\an5}- ALSO, THEY CAN LIVE
200 YEARS.

13:03.282 --> 13:04.366
- KEEP GOING.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.577
{\an5}- ALL THE WHALES
SIT AROUND FAMILY.

13:06.660 --> 13:07.495
- WOW.

13:07.578 --> 13:09.455
{\an5}- REUBEN CAME THROUGH
IN A BIG WAY,

13:09.538 --> 13:12.374
{\an5}AND IN NO TIME, HE WAS
EVEN MAKING UP HIS OWN FACTS.

13:12.458 --> 13:16.420
{\an5}- HAVE YOU EVER FOUGHT
A SHARK?

13:17.630 --> 13:19.256
{\an5}- YEAH.
- YOU HAVE?

13:19.340 --> 13:21.717
{\an5}- YEAH, IT WAS A GREAT--
GREAT WHITE.

13:21.800 --> 13:22.551
- WOW.

13:22.635 --> 13:23.844
{\an5}- WHOA, YOU FOUGHT
A GREAT WHITE?

13:23.928 --> 13:25.179
WHAT DID YOU DO?

13:25.262 --> 13:27.765
{\an5}- HIS MOUTH
LIKE THIS.

13:27.848 --> 13:30.935
{\an5}IF YOU GO THIS WAY,
HE CANNOT TOUCH YOU...

13:31.018 --> 13:32.102
- OKAY.

13:32.186 --> 13:33.395
{\an5}- AND I TRIED,
AND I BEAT IT.

13:33.479 --> 13:36.148
{\an5}- A GREAT WHITE SHARK CAME
TO BITE YOU, AND YOU KICKED IT?

13:36.232 --> 13:37.566
{\an5}- YEAH.
I KICKED IT.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.528
{\an5}- AND DID YOU KILL HIM?
- NO.

13:40.611 --> 13:43.239
{\an5}YEAH, I KILL HIM.
- OH, WOW.

13:43.322 --> 13:45.491
- PRETTY GOOD, HUH?

13:45.574 --> 13:46.742
{\an5}- YEAH, IT'S--
IT'S REALLY INTERESTING.

13:46.825 --> 13:48.077
{\an5}- DO YOU LIKE THIS SYSTEM?
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN IT BEFORE?

13:48.160 --> 13:49.370
- NO.

13:49.453 --> 13:50.913
{\an5}- WOULD YOU TELL YOUR FRIENDS
ABOUT IT?

13:50.996 --> 13:52.164
- UH, SURE.

13:52.248 --> 13:55.626
{\an5}- REUBEN FAR SURPASSED
ANY EXPECTATIONS I HAD FOR HIM,

13:55.709 --> 13:57.962
{\an5}AND I COULDN'T WAIT
TO SHOW NETTABI THE RESULTS.

13:58.045 --> 13:59.296
{\an5}- 'CAUSE THIS WAY,
HE CANNOT TOUCH YOU...

13:59.380 --> 14:01.298
{\an5}- WOW.
- AND I TRIED, AND I BEAT HIM.

14:01.382 --> 14:02.633
- THAT'S GOOD.

14:02.716 --> 14:04.426
{\an5}- YOU LIKE IT?
- THE CUSTOMER LOOKS HAPPY.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.177
{\an5}AND THE DRIVER
WAS COMFORTABLE.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.637
SO I LIKE IT.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.557
{\an5}- I'M SO HAPPY
I COULD HELP YOU.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.809
{\an5}UM, DO YOU MIND IF I LEAVE YOU
MY BUSINESS CARD?

14:11.892 --> 14:16.564
- ABSOLUTELY.

14:20.192 --> 14:21.026
- BASICALLY, TO CARE FOR IT,

14:21.110 --> 14:23.988
{\an5}YOU JUST HAVE TO FEED IT
KIND OF WHEAT--

14:24.071 --> 14:25.948
{\an5}- EVERY DAY, I HAVE TO LOOK
AT YOUR CARD.

14:26.031 --> 14:28.284
{\an5}- YOU CARE FOR IT, YEAH.
- OH, THAT'S A BRILLIANT IDEA.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.119
{\an5}- YEAH, BECAUSE YOU NEVER FORGET
WHO GAVE IT TO YOU.

14:30.202 --> 14:32.621
{\an5}- YES, YOU ARE FULL--
FULL OF GOOD IDEAS.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.415
{\an5}- OH, GREAT.
- HAVE A GOOD DAY.

14:34.498 --> 14:35.666
{\an5}- YOU TOO.
- GOOD TO MEET YOU.

14:35.749 --> 14:38.627
- BYE, BYE.

14:42.089 --> 14:43.090
{\an5}- EARLIER, I SET UP
ONE OF MY EMPLOYEES

14:43.173 --> 14:44.675
{\an5}ON A BLIND DATE,
AND THE GIRL

14:44.758 --> 14:46.135
{\an5}I PICKED FOR HIM
WAS SOMEONE

14:46.218 --> 14:48.053
{\an5}THAT I MET
ON MY FAKE DATING SHOW--RACHEL.

14:48.137 --> 14:50.806
{\an5}- THERE'S NO ONE ELSE LIKE ME.
[laughs]

14:50.889 --> 14:52.641
{\an5}- AS PART OF THE AGREEMENT
WITH QUIZNOS,

14:52.725 --> 14:53.726
{\an5}SOLOMON WAS GONNA HAVE TO SAY
SOME BRANDING CUES

14:53.809 --> 14:56.395
{\an5}FROM THE COMPANY
DURING HIS DATE.

14:56.478 --> 14:57.313
{\an5}SO I GAVE HIM
A HIDDEN EARPIECE

14:57.396 --> 14:59.440
{\an5}AND STATIONED MYSELF
IN THE BACK ROOM

14:59.523 --> 15:00.691
{\an5}WITH A QUIZNOS MARKETING REP
SO I COULD TELL HIM

15:00.774 --> 15:04.111
{\an5}WHAT TO SAY
DURING HIS DATE.

15:04.194 --> 15:05.154
{\an5}I COULD TELL SOLOMON
WAS NERVOUS,

15:05.237 --> 15:08.699
{\an5}BUT HE LOOKED FANTASTIC
IN MY GRANDPA'S SUIT.

15:08.782 --> 15:11.452
{\an5}I JUST HOPED THAT HE COULD
HIT IT OFF WITH RACHEL.

15:11.535 --> 15:13.579
{\an5}- HI, MY NAME
IS SOLOMON.

15:13.662 --> 15:16.665
- HI.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.167
I'M RACHEL.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.752
- YOU HAVE NICE EYES.

15:19.835 --> 15:20.586
- OH, THANK YOU.

15:20.669 --> 15:24.423
{\an5}SO DO YOU.
- THANK YOU.

15:24.506 --> 15:25.799
- YOU COULD ASK HER IF--

15:25.883 --> 15:27.843
{\an5}"WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE
QUIZNOS SUB?"

15:27.926 --> 15:30.638
{\an5}- ALL RIGHT, IS THAT KIND
OF WEIRD EARLY ON IN THE DATE?

15:30.721 --> 15:32.556
{\an5}I TRIED TO HOLD OFF
THE QUIZNOS REP AS LONG

15:32.640 --> 15:35.184

COULD REALLY CONNECT...

15:35.267 --> 15:37.019
{\an5}- HAVE YOU SEEN
THE MOVIE <i> CLICK?</i>

15:37.102 --> 15:38.437
- NO.

15:38.520 --> 15:42.691
{\an5}- OH, IT'S ABOUT, UM, A GUY
THAT GETS THIS REMOTE CONTROL,

15:42.775 --> 15:44.276
AND HE CONTROL LIFE.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.028
{\an5}- OH, WOW, AWESOME.
- YEAH.

15:46.111 --> 15:47.780
{\an5}- BUT, EVENTUALLY,
SHE WAS JUST TOO PERSISTENT.

15:47.863 --> 15:51.116
{\an5}- DID YOU KNOW
THE BAJA CHICKEN HAS...

15:51.200 --> 15:55.454
{\an5}- CHEF-INSPIRED...
- CHEF-INSPIRED SAUCES?

15:55.537 --> 15:59.875
{\an5}- DID YOU KNOW THE BAJA CHICKEN
HAS CHEF-INSPIRED SAUCES?

15:59.958 --> 16:01.752
{\an5}- OH, REALLY?
COOL.

16:01.835 --> 16:05.547
{\an5}- HAVE HIM SAY,
"MM, TOASTY."

16:05.631 --> 16:07.883
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

16:07.966 --> 16:09.301
- SO, UM...

16:09.385 --> 16:12.346
{\an5}- WILL YOU SAY, "MM, TOASTY"
AFTER YOU BITE IT?

16:12.429 --> 16:13.931
- MM.

16:14.014 --> 16:15.891
TOASTY.

16:15.974 --> 16:17.017
- [chuckles]

16:17.101 --> 16:19.061

ABOUT THE ARTISAN BREADS,

16:19.937 --> 16:22.898
{\an5}- OKAY, I'M--
I LOVE QUIZNOS,

16:22.981 --> 16:24.108
{\an5}AND I'M HAPPY
TO DO THIS,

16:24.191 --> 16:28.696
{\an5}BUT CAN WE LET THEM
DO THEIR THING FOR A BIT,

16:28.779 --> 16:30.239
{\an5}AND GET TO KNOW
EACH OTHER?

16:30.322 --> 16:30.948
- OKAY.

16:31.031 --> 16:32.449
{\an5}- BE GENUINE.
BE YOURSELF.

16:32.533 --> 16:35.494
SPEAK FROM THE HEART.

16:35.577 --> 16:38.372
{\an5}- DO YOU--
DO YOU KNOW ANY POEMS?

16:38.455 --> 16:40.416
- NO.

16:40.499 --> 16:43.168
{\an5}DO YOU?
- YES, I DO.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.379

16:51.385 --> 16:54.596
{\an5}- AW.
THANKS.

16:54.680 --> 16:58.016
{\an5}- YOU'RE WELCOME.
- THAT'S GOOD.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.269
{\an5}- YEAH, IF WE CAN THROW IN
THE TAG LINE AGAIN.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.771
{\an5}- ALL RIGHT,
WRAP IT UP, SOLOMON.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.523
- SO, UH, IT SEEMS,

17:05.607 --> 17:10.695
UH, THAT WE'RE DONE WITH...

17:10.779 --> 17:15.784

17:17.744 --> 17:19.454
- GREAT.

17:19.538 --> 17:20.204
- YOU'RE REAL PRETTY

17:20.289 --> 17:24.209
{\an5}AND I WANT
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

17:24.292 --> 17:26.502
{\an5}- EVEN WITH THE AWKWARDNESS
OF OUR PRODUCT PLACEMENT,

17:26.587 --> 17:29.381
{\an5}I WAS SO HAPPY THINGS WORKED OUT
FOR SOLOMON.

17:29.465 --> 17:32.509
{\an5}BUT THERE WAS STILL ONE THING
I HAD TO LOOK INTO.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.138
{\an5}- EARLIER TONIGHT, YOU SAW ME
HELP A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.931
{\an5}BUT WHAT I DIDN'T SHOW YOU
IS THAT AFTER WE WERE DONE,

17:38.015 --> 17:39.558
{\an5}I ASKED HIM IF HE WANTED
TO HANG OUT,

17:39.641 --> 17:41.602
AND HE REBUFFED ME.

17:41.685 --> 17:42.853
{\an5}WOULD YOU WANNA HANG OUT
ON SATURDAY NIGHT?

17:42.936 --> 17:44.897
- NO, IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

17:44.980 --> 17:45.689
{\an5}- WHY?
- I HAVE PLANS.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.608
{\an5}- YOU HAVE PLANS?
- I DO.

17:47.691 --> 17:48.984
{\an5}- ON SATURDAY?
- I DO.

17:49.067 --> 17:51.236
{\an5}- WHAT ARE
THE PLANS?

17:51.320 --> 17:53.363
{\an5}- TAKING MY GIRL
OUT TO DINNER.

17:53.447 --> 17:54.490
{\an5}- YOU'RE GOING OUT TO DINNER
WITH YOUR GIRL?

17:54.573 --> 17:55.491
- YES.

17:55.574 --> 17:56.825
- ALL RIGHT.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.410
{\an5}BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING
IN BRIAN'S TONE

17:58.494 --> 17:59.995
{\an5}THAT JUST DIDN'T SEEM RIGHT
TO ME,

18:00.078 --> 18:02.164
{\an5}SO I HIRED A SECOND PRIVATE
INVESTIGATOR TO SPY ON BRIAN

18:02.247 --> 18:04.166
{\an5}TO SEE IF HE REALLY WENT OUT
WITH HIS GIRL.

18:04.249 --> 18:07.086
{\an5}- AND IF IT'S OPEN,
HE'S DEFINITELY HOME.

18:07.169 --> 18:08.045
- YEAH, EXACTLY.

18:08.128 --> 18:10.422
{\an8}I NEVER SAW HIM LEAVE
AT ALL, PERIOD.

18:10.506 --> 18:11.590
{\an8}- 'CAUSE HE TOLD ME HE WAS GOING
OUT WITH HIS GIRL THAT NIGHT.

18:11.673 --> 18:14.927
- OH, INTERESTING.

18:15.010 --> 18:16.220
{\an5}YOU DON'T LOOK
TOO HAPPY.

18:16.303 --> 18:18.180
{\an5}- NO, I'M JUST--
I'M SURPRISED HE LIED TO ME.

18:18.263 --> 18:21.225
{\an5}WHAT--DO YOU THINK THE GUY,
LIKE--HE DIDN'T LIKE ME, OR...

18:21.308 --> 18:22.559
{\an5}- I DON'T KNOW,
YOU KNOW?

18:22.643 --> 18:24.686
{\an5}I MEAN, SOMET--I MEAN,
IF I DON'T LIKE SOMEBODY

18:24.770 --> 18:25.979
{\an5}AND THEY'D ASK ME THAT,
I'D PROBABLY SAY,

18:26.063 --> 18:27.189
{\an5}"I'D LOVE TO GO OUT
WITH YOU.

18:27.272 --> 18:28.440
I'M JUST REALLY BUSY."

18:28.524 --> 18:29.608
{\an5}- RIGHT, SO HE WAS JUST TRYING
TO GET RID OF ME.

18:29.691 --> 18:30.859
{\an5}- I THINK HE WAS TRYING
TO GET RID OF YOU.

18:30.943 --> 18:31.860
{\an5}- [chuckles]
- THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.071
{\an5}NO--SORRY ABOUT THAT, BUT--
- NO, NO, NO.

18:34.154 --> 18:36.156
{\an5}- IT'S JUST MY OPINION.
- YEAH, YOU DID A GREAT JOB.
