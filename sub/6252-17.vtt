WEBVTT

00:02.339 --> 00:03.357
It's so dark.

00:03.358 --> 00:05.175
All new border agents
start out on night duty.

00:05.260 --> 00:06.293
Get used to it.

00:06.344 --> 00:07.728
Everything up past that rock
is Canada.

00:07.795 --> 00:08.979
That's all you got to know.

00:09.064 --> 00:10.514
Unless you forget
your long johns,

00:10.598 --> 00:11.682
it's a piece of cake.

00:11.766 --> 00:13.350
What about smugglers
or terrorists?

00:13.435 --> 00:14.801
This ain't Mexico, bucko.

00:14.853 --> 00:16.737
At most you'll get
a Mohawk slicking beer

00:16.804 --> 00:18.305
across the border
to avoid taxes.

00:19.157 --> 00:22.142
Where do they get you trainees?

00:22.193 --> 00:24.411
You can't even walk without
tripping over your own feet.

00:24.479 --> 00:25.662
Those aren't my feet!

00:29.584 --> 00:31.034
Oh, crap.

00:34.839 --> 00:36.540
This is gonna be
a lot of paperwork.

00:40.845 --> 00:42.296
Hey.

00:42.347 --> 00:43.497
What's wrong?

00:43.548 --> 00:44.765
Nothing.

00:44.832 --> 00:46.717
It's just, I received

00:46.801 --> 00:48.519
this letter of acceptance
from Columbia.

00:48.603 --> 00:49.887
Ooh, congratulations.

00:49.971 --> 00:51.054
In what?

00:51.139 --> 00:52.189
Undergraduate French literature.

00:52.273 --> 00:53.190
Are you telling me

00:53.274 --> 00:54.525
in some roundabout way

00:54.609 --> 00:56.326
that you want to radically
change your life?

00:56.394 --> 00:57.644
Yes.

00:57.695 --> 00:59.846
I'm also changing my name
to Michelle Welton.

00:59.898 --> 01:01.782
Oh, my God.

01:01.849 --> 01:04.233
Cam's daughter
got into Columbia.

01:04.319 --> 01:05.569
Yep.

01:05.653 --> 01:06.987
Wait, why did you open her mail?

01:07.038 --> 01:11.542
It was in my pile,
because Cam had it sent here.

01:11.626 --> 01:12.876
Cam?

01:12.961 --> 01:14.077
Wouldn't Michelle
give her address

01:14.145 --> 01:16.046
so that it would
just go right to...?

01:18.333 --> 01:21.602
Cam got her daughter
into Columbia behind her back.

01:21.669 --> 01:22.719
Because she didn't want her

01:22.804 --> 01:24.588
to go to that little school
up in Maine.

01:24.672 --> 01:25.839
Oh, wow.

01:25.890 --> 01:27.474
Honey, this is bad parenting.

01:27.542 --> 01:30.194
We will never do anything
like this, promise me now.

01:30.261 --> 01:31.378
What do I do now?

01:31.429 --> 01:33.013
You give it to Cam.

01:33.064 --> 01:34.047
I mean, do I say anything?

01:34.098 --> 01:36.049
No. It is not your business.

01:36.117 --> 01:37.684
Can I give her
a disapproving look?

01:37.735 --> 01:39.153
Of course.

01:40.188 --> 01:42.739
That's a good one.

01:45.393 --> 01:48.562
What's this?

01:48.613 --> 01:50.080
Oh.

01:52.584 --> 01:54.918
You have something to say
about this?

01:55.003 --> 01:57.571
Angela says no.

01:57.622 --> 01:59.206
But this is a disapproving look.

01:59.257 --> 02:00.290
Does it mean anything

02:00.375 --> 02:01.741
that it's all moot?

02:01.793 --> 02:03.910
Michelle is determined
to go to community college

02:03.962 --> 02:06.763
in outer Mongolia
to be with her boyfriend.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:24.699 --> 02:26.867
So you found 11 feet so far?

02:26.934 --> 02:28.118
Yep.

02:28.203 --> 02:30.621
This whole yellow flag section
is our side.

02:30.705 --> 02:32.122
Rest of it's the Canadians.

02:32.207 --> 02:34.124
Well, unless it rained feet,

02:34.209 --> 02:36.210
these puppies definitely
washed ashore.

02:36.277 --> 02:38.996
Yeah, my trainee tripped over
one of them last night.

02:42.333 --> 02:43.917
I think I'll, uh,

02:43.968 --> 02:45.619
wait over there,
if that's okay with you.

02:45.670 --> 02:47.004
Yeah, right,
go grab yourself a donut.

02:47.088 --> 02:49.006
Based on the size,
this belonged to an adult male.

02:49.090 --> 02:50.007
Hmm.

02:50.091 --> 02:51.341
Given the range of motion

02:51.426 --> 02:53.460
of the metatarsophalangeal
joint, I'd say he was

02:53.511 --> 02:55.512
somewhere between 18 and 50.

02:55.580 --> 02:57.797
Great. That narrows it down
to about 50 million people.

02:59.517 --> 03:01.468
Yes, this appears to be a pair.

03:01.519 --> 03:02.519
Great, okay.

03:02.604 --> 03:04.238
Two down, 11 to go.

03:04.305 --> 03:05.522
Oh, nine to go.

03:05.607 --> 03:07.324
These boots are empty.
Hey, Bones,

03:07.408 --> 03:08.808
how much you want to bet
that those boots

03:08.860 --> 03:10.027
belong to Shoeless Joe
over there?

03:10.111 --> 03:12.696
Well, I'll see

03:12.780 --> 03:14.814
if the size of the boots

03:14.866 --> 03:16.033
conform to Joe.

03:16.117 --> 03:18.001
Okay?
Hey, B-Bones,

03:18.086 --> 03:20.087
you know, just, you know,
when you go over there,

03:20.154 --> 03:21.821
just be nice.
They're Canadians.

03:21.873 --> 03:23.624
You're referring to the
broad generalization

03:23.675 --> 03:25.325
that Canadians are polite?

03:25.376 --> 03:26.343
Yes, I am.

03:26.427 --> 03:27.461
Sorry, excuse me.

03:27.512 --> 03:28.545
Dr. Douglas Filmore.

03:28.630 --> 03:30.714
I'm here to examine the feet.

03:30.798 --> 03:31.932
I know him, Booth.

03:31.999 --> 03:33.150
Who?
Him.

03:33.217 --> 03:34.217
Dr. Filmore.

03:36.137 --> 03:37.688
How are you?

03:37.772 --> 03:39.389
Oh.

03:39.474 --> 03:41.975
Dr. Brennan,
it's, uh, been quite a while.

03:42.026 --> 03:43.143
Yes.

03:43.194 --> 03:44.361
Uh, excuse the left hand.

03:44.445 --> 03:47.180
I'm having some issues
with my right arm.

03:48.733 --> 03:52.035
So, you're here to examine
the remains as well, eh?

03:52.120 --> 03:53.036
Yes.

03:53.121 --> 03:54.237
Yes.

03:54.322 --> 03:56.373
Um, this is Special Agent
Seeley Booth, FBI.

03:56.457 --> 03:58.024
We're partners.
Nice to meet you.

03:58.076 --> 03:59.326
Pleasure.
So what happened

03:59.377 --> 04:01.244
to your arm?
It was Thursday, May 9.

04:01.329 --> 04:02.963
I was in my office
doing some reading,

04:03.030 --> 04:04.831
and my right arm
just ceased to function.

04:04.882 --> 04:06.717
The physicians
can't seem to find the cause.

04:06.784 --> 04:08.051
Very tough.
I'm sorry to hear that.

04:08.136 --> 04:10.837
Coincidentally,
I had just finished reading

04:10.888 --> 04:13.039
Dr. Brennan's
incredibly thorough

04:13.091 --> 04:15.892
repudiation of my attempts
to get my field of study

04:15.977 --> 04:17.894
recognized by the Board
of Forensic Scientists.

04:17.978 --> 04:18.928
Oh, boy. Oh...

04:19.012 --> 04:20.063
I-I work extremely hard

04:20.148 --> 04:21.180
on being thorough.

04:21.232 --> 04:23.216
It's gratifying
when someone notices.

04:23.267 --> 04:24.217
Thank you.

04:24.268 --> 04:25.902
You're welcome.

04:25.987 --> 04:28.438
So, w-what exactly
do you do again?

04:28.523 --> 04:30.857
Dr. Filmore calls himself a
forensic podiatrist even though

04:30.908 --> 04:33.777
that's not an officially
recognized discipline.

04:33.861 --> 04:36.830
Yes, I am merely
a board certified podiatrist

04:36.897 --> 04:38.582
who assists
law enforcement professionals

04:38.666 --> 04:40.033
by providing sound
podiatric analysis

04:40.084 --> 04:42.836
to forensic investigations.

04:42.903 --> 04:45.238
But I thank you
for correcting me, Dr. Brennan.

04:45.289 --> 04:47.374
You're very welcome.

04:47.425 --> 04:49.576
So, can you, uh, tell me

04:49.627 --> 04:51.077
how long these feet
have been in the river?

04:51.129 --> 04:52.078
No.
No.

04:52.130 --> 04:53.463
I need to take all of the feet

04:53.548 --> 04:55.382
back to the Jeffersonian
for further examination.

04:55.433 --> 04:57.934
Uh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

04:58.019 --> 05:00.103
Excuse me. Would you be so good
as to point out for me

05:00.188 --> 05:02.556
the international boundary?

05:02.607 --> 05:06.059
Straight shot from that rock
over there to the border marker

05:06.110 --> 05:07.444
and right across the river.

05:07.528 --> 05:08.779
I see. So, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry.

05:08.863 --> 05:10.197
Okay, whoa, whoa, look.

05:10.264 --> 05:12.032
Pal, we're supposed to be
cooperating here, that's all.

05:12.099 --> 05:13.233
I'm sorry,
Dr. Brennan,

05:13.284 --> 05:15.101
but as far as we're
concerned, these are

05:15.153 --> 05:17.454
Canadian feet, and as such,
they will be examined

05:17.538 --> 05:21.575
by an ordinary,
garden-variety podiatrist.

05:21.626 --> 05:22.793
That's great.

05:22.877 --> 05:24.044
Now look what you've done.

05:24.111 --> 05:25.662
Thank you.

06:03.991 --> 06:05.492
So, Brennan said the victim
was a golfer?

06:05.576 --> 06:06.493
Yes.

06:06.577 --> 06:09.746
From the X-rays
of his feet?

06:09.797 --> 06:10.880
Apparently, the osteomorphosis

06:10.948 --> 06:12.281
of his metaspacial turtlicious
proves it.

06:12.333 --> 06:14.501
You made those words up.

06:14.585 --> 06:15.919
Hey, you want the real thing,
you're gonna

06:15.970 --> 06:17.754
have to read
the podiatrist's article.

06:17.805 --> 06:19.806
The one that Brennan refuted?

06:19.890 --> 06:21.674
Booth says that
she refuted him so hard

06:21.759 --> 06:23.143
that it paralyzed his arm.

06:23.227 --> 06:24.427
Really?

06:24.478 --> 06:26.796
Well, then why did she ask him
to work the case with us?

06:26.864 --> 06:28.631
Because he has the rest
of the feet Brennan wants.

06:28.682 --> 06:31.568
Jurisdictionally speaking,
those feet are Canadian.

06:31.635 --> 06:33.302
Hmm, severed feet.

06:33.354 --> 06:35.471
Ugh, Canucks can have them.

06:35.523 --> 06:36.639
No, they weren't cut off.

06:36.690 --> 06:38.658
The feet fell off
the rest of the bodies

06:38.742 --> 06:40.827
when they were in the water,
and then the shoes

06:40.911 --> 06:43.530
kind of floated them
to the surface.

06:43.614 --> 06:45.248
Wow.

06:45.315 --> 06:47.617
Man, is it me or do these...

06:47.668 --> 06:49.285
smell like a bad gym?

06:49.336 --> 06:52.088
Seriously stinks, right?

06:52.155 --> 06:53.289
Ugh.

06:53.340 --> 06:55.175
Okay, if they were in the river,

06:55.259 --> 06:57.210
wouldn't that sweat smell
be gone?

06:57.294 --> 06:59.095
Absolutely.

06:59.162 --> 07:01.714
These boots weren't worn
by someone in the river,

07:01.799 --> 07:03.783
more likely someone
who encountered these feet.

07:03.851 --> 07:04.784
Would there be enough

07:04.852 --> 07:07.637
sweat in the boot
to extract DNA?

07:07.688 --> 07:10.807
The human foot sweats an average
of one cup a day.

07:10.858 --> 07:13.175
You know, there are some things

07:13.227 --> 07:15.395
that I really
don't need to know.

07:17.731 --> 07:19.899
Dr. Filmore got clearance

07:19.984 --> 07:22.318
from the Canadian government
to work with you.

07:22.369 --> 07:24.153
He should be here today
with the feet.

07:24.205 --> 07:25.154
Great.

07:25.206 --> 07:26.856
I read the article you wrote.

07:26.907 --> 07:28.575
It's quite good, wasn't it?

07:28.642 --> 07:29.993
Booth is right,
you should apologize.

07:30.044 --> 07:31.244
What?

07:31.328 --> 07:32.996
You undermined his life's work.

07:33.047 --> 07:35.582
You dismissed him
and ridiculed the notion

07:35.666 --> 07:37.033
that he be recognized
as a forensic podiatrist.

07:37.084 --> 07:39.368
I had to, otherwise, we'd have
forensic dermatologists,

07:39.420 --> 07:40.887
forensic chiropractors.

07:40.971 --> 07:41.888
Where would it end?

07:41.972 --> 07:43.056
You paralyzed the guy,

07:43.123 --> 07:44.390
Bones, okay?

07:44.475 --> 07:45.842
Dr. Sweets here
did his research

07:45.893 --> 07:47.393
and he's gonna get
shrinky with you.

07:47.478 --> 07:48.394
Get shrinky with her.

07:48.479 --> 07:49.679
Are you two ganging up on me?

07:49.730 --> 07:52.899
His paralysis sounds like
conversion disorder.

07:52.983 --> 07:56.402
A major stress event
creates a psychic conflict.

07:56.487 --> 07:58.438
The person converts
that intrapsychic distress

07:58.522 --> 07:59.689
into physical symptoms

07:59.740 --> 08:01.357
as a way of resolving an issue

08:01.408 --> 08:02.408
that he can't deal
with emotionally.

08:02.493 --> 08:03.893
Exactly. Whatever he said.

08:03.944 --> 08:05.945
So it's my fault that he can't
deal with his own life?

08:06.030 --> 08:07.614
You just don't get
it, do you, Bones?

08:07.698 --> 08:09.699
Not at all.

08:09.750 --> 08:12.452
Well, got a DNA match
off the sweaty boot.

08:12.536 --> 08:13.920
Canadian ex-con
with mental health issues.

08:14.004 --> 08:14.921
Sounds like you're up.

08:15.005 --> 08:16.005
I'm on it.

08:18.709 --> 08:21.077
Sometimes, wouldn't you
just like to be a person

08:21.128 --> 08:22.679
like the rest of us instead of

08:22.746 --> 08:24.213
someone who just
paralyzes people?

08:24.265 --> 08:26.799
Those of us who tell the truth

08:26.884 --> 08:29.552
have always endured
harsh judgment...

08:29.603 --> 08:31.971
Copernicus, Galileo.

08:32.039 --> 08:34.974
I accept that as something
I have to deal with.

08:36.943 --> 08:38.193
Okay, so the blank columns

08:38.260 --> 08:39.479
are for the Canadian feet.

08:39.563 --> 08:41.030
Exactly. According
to Booth,

08:41.097 --> 08:43.116
our neighbors to the
north have two pairs

08:43.183 --> 08:44.901
and two individual feet.

08:44.952 --> 08:45.902
Okay, so eight victims total.

08:45.953 --> 08:48.104
So far. No bodies,
just feet.

08:48.155 --> 08:50.740
It's kind of like having
no vowels in a Scrabble game.

08:50.791 --> 08:52.258
The inside of the shoes showed

08:52.326 --> 08:55.328
traces of a sticky residue,
like some insoluble protein,

08:55.412 --> 08:57.830
so I ran it through
the Mass Spec.

08:57.915 --> 08:59.616
It was spider mite silk.

08:59.683 --> 09:02.218
Now, until I identify species,
all it tells us

09:02.286 --> 09:04.037
is that the victims were
all in the same location

09:04.104 --> 09:05.838
before they got
dumped in the river.

09:05.923 --> 09:08.107
So you might be able to tell us
where the murders took place?

09:08.175 --> 09:09.108
Mm-hmm.

09:09.176 --> 09:10.426
You're so amazing.

09:10.477 --> 09:11.411
So are you.

09:11.478 --> 09:12.628
No, no.

09:12.680 --> 09:13.730
Not here.

09:13.797 --> 09:15.464
Not over feet.

09:15.516 --> 09:19.402
Sorry to be a bother, but
I-I'm looking for Dr. Brennan.

09:19.469 --> 09:20.770
Oh.

09:20.821 --> 09:23.773
You must be Dr. Filmore.

09:23.824 --> 09:25.775
Hi. I'm Angela Montenegro.

09:25.826 --> 09:26.993
Come on up.

09:28.062 --> 09:29.078
Thank you.

09:31.365 --> 09:32.365
Hey, sorry.

09:32.449 --> 09:33.666
Uh, Jack Hodgins.

09:33.751 --> 09:34.784
Pleasure.

09:34.835 --> 09:36.536
Uh, we've heard
so much about you.

09:36.620 --> 09:38.171
Oh. Well,
the pleasure's mine.

09:38.255 --> 09:39.655
Dr. Saroyan.

09:39.707 --> 09:40.957
Oh. Sorry.

09:41.008 --> 09:41.958
Oh.

09:42.009 --> 09:43.876
Uh, welcome.

09:43.961 --> 09:46.846
I wasn't sure you were
actually going to join us.

09:46.930 --> 09:47.797
Why?

09:47.848 --> 09:49.215
Because of...

09:51.468 --> 09:53.019
You know...

09:53.103 --> 09:55.888
Oh, well, I-I felt it was
only right to use my expertise

09:55.973 --> 09:57.640
to help solve this crime.

09:57.691 --> 09:59.225
Ooh, lovely shoes.

09:59.309 --> 10:00.476
Oh, thank you.

10:00.527 --> 10:02.311
The average increase
in the protrusion of

10:02.379 --> 10:05.398
a woman's buttocks is 25%
when wearing high-heeled shoes.

10:05.482 --> 10:07.650
Okay.

10:07.701 --> 10:10.737
That fact was responsible for
catching a killer in Manitoba.

10:11.905 --> 10:13.206
That's very impressive.

10:13.290 --> 10:14.690
Oh, no, no, no.

10:14.742 --> 10:16.743
I'm merely an expert
in one quarter

10:16.827 --> 10:18.961
of the bones of the human body,
which makes me

10:19.029 --> 10:20.980
one quarter of the expert
Dr. Brennan is.

10:21.048 --> 10:22.515
I-I wouldn't put it that way.

10:22.583 --> 10:23.532
Oh, I didn't.

10:23.584 --> 10:26.535
I'm quoting Dr. Brennan.

10:27.554 --> 10:28.704
Okay.

10:28.756 --> 10:30.173
Let's look at feet.

10:32.176 --> 10:34.177
Oh, very interesting.

10:34.228 --> 10:35.561
Very, very interesting.

10:37.598 --> 10:38.981
I didn't kill anyone.

10:39.049 --> 10:43.403
I-I like puppies
and butterflies.

10:43.487 --> 10:45.822
The doctors at Dorchester
Mental Health Facility told me

10:45.889 --> 10:49.192
that you almost blinded another
patient with laundry detergent.

10:49.243 --> 10:52.845
He grabbed my raisins
out of my rice pudding.

10:52.913 --> 10:54.747
With his fingers, man!

10:54.832 --> 10:56.398
What would you have done?

10:56.450 --> 10:59.235
We found your DNA
at a crime scene, Bernie.

10:59.303 --> 11:01.904
I got no idea
what you're talking about.

11:01.972 --> 11:03.623
We found your boots
by the river.

11:03.690 --> 11:05.091
That's where we got your DNA,

11:05.175 --> 11:07.210
right next to a whole bunch
of feet.

11:07.261 --> 11:09.078
Can you tell us
where those feet came from?

11:09.129 --> 11:10.763
I don't know, man.

11:10.848 --> 11:12.748
Maybe a fish coughed 'em up.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.767
I just...

11:14.835 --> 11:18.187
I found the right size shoes,
and... took out the feet.

11:18.255 --> 11:19.906
Just like that?
No.

11:19.973 --> 11:21.941
I threw up first.

11:22.025 --> 11:23.425
Exactly when

11:23.477 --> 11:25.928
did this shoe swap occur?

11:25.979 --> 11:28.731
Eight... eight days ago.

11:28.782 --> 11:30.566
I'm afraid we're going to need
those shoes back.

11:30.634 --> 11:33.619
But... man, I just...
I just broke 'em in!

11:33.704 --> 11:36.289
No, don't let the Americans
take my shoes.

11:36.373 --> 11:38.374
Please.

11:41.879 --> 11:44.113
Even though there's
a half-size difference

11:44.164 --> 11:45.498
between these two feet,

11:45.582 --> 11:47.783
they appear to be a matching pair.
Oh.

11:47.835 --> 11:50.086
60% of the general public has
two differently sized feet,

11:50.137 --> 11:52.588
and 80% of those have
a larger left foot.

11:52.639 --> 11:53.622
That's common knowledge.

11:53.674 --> 11:55.791
The, uh,

11:55.843 --> 11:59.745
level of decomp suggests
the victim died about

11:59.813 --> 12:02.014
two months ago.
Already established.

12:02.099 --> 12:04.417
All of the victims died between
one and three months ago.

12:04.485 --> 12:09.572
There are striae on the top of
the talus of the right foot.

12:09.639 --> 12:13.576
Unlike the other feet,
which disarticulated naturally,

12:13.643 --> 12:15.444
this foot was cut off.

12:15.512 --> 12:17.446
When the victim
was still alive.

12:17.498 --> 12:18.998
I would have noticed
that, of course.

12:19.082 --> 12:20.783
Of course.

12:25.255 --> 12:28.291
I hope you will be comfortable
here, Dr. Filmore.

12:28.342 --> 12:31.043
Well thank you.
I'm sure I will be.

12:33.663 --> 12:38.267
My colleagues have been
encouraging me to...

12:38.335 --> 12:40.336
apologize to you.

12:40.387 --> 12:42.355
Oh?
I told them

12:42.439 --> 12:44.607
that you hadn't asked
for an apology.

12:44.674 --> 12:46.809
Well, it wouldn't be appropriate
for me to ask for it.

12:46.860 --> 12:48.978
Exactly.
I-I really have no idea

12:49.029 --> 12:49.979
what they're talking about.

12:50.030 --> 12:52.298
I'm glad you feel the same way.

12:53.217 --> 12:54.150
Hey.

12:54.201 --> 12:56.018
So, Sweets called

12:56.069 --> 12:58.487
to say that the feet washed up
at least eight days ago.

12:58.539 --> 13:01.490
So, I checked the National
Weather Service charts.

13:01.542 --> 13:03.743
They gave me rainfall
and wind patterns,

13:03.810 --> 13:06.162
which allowed me to determine
where the feet originated.

13:06.213 --> 13:07.630
That's very impressive.

13:07.697 --> 13:10.666
Yes. Everyone here
is quite extraordinary.

13:10.717 --> 13:12.802
Okay.

13:12.869 --> 13:14.170
So the feet came from here,

13:14.221 --> 13:16.222
next to the St. Regis River.

13:18.175 --> 13:20.343
The University of Hogansburg,
New York.

13:20.394 --> 13:22.428
Hogansburg.

13:22.512 --> 13:24.847
I... I know what happened.

13:24.898 --> 13:26.215
Wait...

13:29.236 --> 13:30.736
A body farm?

13:30.821 --> 13:34.190
The University of Hogansburg has
one of three research facilities

13:34.241 --> 13:36.826
where forensic anthropologists
can study decomposition

13:36.893 --> 13:37.994
of bodies after death.

13:38.061 --> 13:39.228
Wow, okay, you're saying that

13:39.279 --> 13:40.729
they have a field
of dead people.

13:40.781 --> 13:41.897
Some are in fields,

13:41.949 --> 13:44.667
some in water, some hung, some

13:44.734 --> 13:45.918
in fires...

13:46.003 --> 13:48.037
They put the remains
in different environments

13:48.088 --> 13:49.738
and see how they break down.

13:49.790 --> 13:51.374
All right, that sounds like
a really nice school.

13:51.425 --> 13:53.075
I know. Anyway,

13:53.126 --> 13:55.511
there was a storm
eight days ago,

13:55.578 --> 13:57.546
and part of the Farm
flooded, washing

13:57.598 --> 13:59.348
seven bodies
into the St. Regis River.

13:59.416 --> 14:00.683
Okay, so we're good, then.

14:00.750 --> 14:01.884
No foul play, except for

14:01.935 --> 14:03.585
the creepy people
who play with the bodies.

14:03.637 --> 14:07.256
Not exactly. The professor said
that seven bodies washed away.

14:07.307 --> 14:10.426
But we have the feet
of an eighth person.

14:10.477 --> 14:13.145
This is a murder.

14:22.146 --> 14:24.731
The university sent these photos

14:24.815 --> 14:27.684
of the remains
that they lost in the flood.

14:27.735 --> 14:29.736
Oh, I've already matched all
the feet with the remains.

14:29.820 --> 14:31.538
Oh. That was fast.

14:31.622 --> 14:33.590
But these feet...

14:33.658 --> 14:35.659
Judging from the decomp,
I place the time of death

14:35.710 --> 14:37.077
at approximately two months ago.

14:37.161 --> 14:39.696
Okay. So he was a murder victim.
Well,

14:39.747 --> 14:42.382
Dr. Brennan would say he could
still be alive but footless,

14:42.466 --> 14:43.833
because without the rest
of the remains,

14:43.885 --> 14:45.502
we have no tangible proof
of his demise.

14:45.553 --> 14:46.720
I just got the shoes

14:46.804 --> 14:48.088
that the homeless guy took.

14:48.172 --> 14:49.756
Nice kicks.
Right?

14:49.840 --> 14:52.475
Luxury edition,
25th anniversary,

14:52.543 --> 14:55.095
Platinum Kick Parkours.

14:55.179 --> 14:57.647
They retail for $2,000.

14:57.715 --> 14:59.316
Now I'm analyzing
the residue in the shoes

14:59.383 --> 15:01.401
to see if it matches what
I found on the other feet.

15:01.485 --> 15:02.769
In order to ID the victim,

15:02.853 --> 15:05.488
we'll need to see if these
are, in fact, his shoes.

15:07.358 --> 15:09.326
Can I use the modeling
software on your computer?

15:09.393 --> 15:11.894
We need to construct
a wire frame image of the feet

15:11.946 --> 15:13.663
to map all their contours,
and then we can

15:13.731 --> 15:15.332
match them with the impressions
made in the sneakers.

15:15.399 --> 15:18.051
Who would pay
two grand for sneakers?

15:18.119 --> 15:20.136
People love to pamper
their feet, and rightfully so.

15:20.204 --> 15:22.572
You know, feet are what separate
us from less evolved hominids.

15:22.623 --> 15:24.073
How about brains?

15:24.125 --> 15:25.241
I like to believe

15:25.293 --> 15:26.626
the fact we walk upright

15:26.711 --> 15:28.845
is the reason our brains developed.
Hey.

15:28.912 --> 15:31.247
Hey, guys, there's
a-a serial number on the tongue.

15:31.299 --> 15:33.249
Of course.

15:33.301 --> 15:35.251
They're limited editions.

15:35.303 --> 15:38.355
If we can confirm that these
shoes belong to these feet,

15:38.422 --> 15:40.941
we can search the serial number
for the name of the owner.

15:41.025 --> 15:43.926
Uh, Ms. Montenegro, would you
put the 3-D scan of the foot

15:43.978 --> 15:45.552
into the corresponding
wire frame shoe?

15:45.553 --> 15:46.753
Yeah.

15:49.767 --> 15:52.652
Yeah. These are definitely
our victim's shoes.

15:52.737 --> 15:57.741
Wow. You just... out-me-ed me.

16:01.445 --> 16:03.546
<i>I... he...</i>

16:03.614 --> 16:05.165
We...

16:05.249 --> 16:08.134
Oh, God.

16:08.219 --> 16:10.053
All right.

16:10.120 --> 16:13.290
All I got between
the sobs is...

16:13.357 --> 16:15.175
Derrick broke up with you?

16:15.259 --> 16:16.959
Yes!

16:17.011 --> 16:18.728
Oh.

16:18.796 --> 16:22.182
Because... you wouldn't
have sex with him, or...?

16:22.266 --> 16:24.401
That's... not
what he said.

16:24.468 --> 16:25.852
What'd he say?

16:25.936 --> 16:27.937
That he didn't want
to wake up in ten years

16:27.989 --> 16:31.408
and realize he'd committed
to one person too soon.

16:31.475 --> 16:33.243
That makes sense.
What?

16:33.310 --> 16:35.395
That... kid's dense.

16:35.463 --> 16:37.364
You know what
this means, right?

16:37.431 --> 16:41.584
That you can date other guys?

16:42.853 --> 16:44.954
That is... not
the right answer.

16:45.006 --> 16:48.642
I can't go to the same college
that Derek is going to.

16:48.709 --> 16:50.427
Oh, right.

16:50.494 --> 16:52.345
Really?

16:52.413 --> 16:54.047
Of... course you can't.

16:54.131 --> 16:56.099
And don't worry, we'll
think of something.

16:56.166 --> 16:57.434
What?

16:57.501 --> 17:01.254
No schools are accepting
applications anymore.

17:02.306 --> 17:04.357
I've... got an idea.

17:06.143 --> 17:09.679
So Hodgins determined
that the mystery feet

17:09.747 --> 17:13.333
had the same mite silk that
was found on the other feet

17:13.401 --> 17:14.517
missing from the Farm.

17:14.568 --> 17:16.368
Those feet had time
of death of two months.

17:16.454 --> 17:17.750
No one was reported
missing two months ago.

17:17.751 --> 17:18.800
Which is why

17:18.806 --> 17:21.724
more expertise is required
than just feet.

17:21.791 --> 17:23.209
Yeah, right. Gosh.

17:23.294 --> 17:25.310
You're really, you really
are not going to stop

17:25.378 --> 17:26.896
until this Canadian foot guy

17:26.964 --> 17:28.932
is paralyzed from head to toe.

17:28.999 --> 17:30.800
Would you accept an agent
who specialized in

17:30.868 --> 17:33.053
murders that only occurred
in February?

17:33.137 --> 17:35.305
Okay, that's different.
Not to me.

17:35.372 --> 17:38.641
Oh, I hear they have over 60
decomposing bodies here.

17:38.709 --> 17:40.143
It's exciting, isn't it?

17:40.210 --> 17:44.080
Look, the liquefaction
of tissues is nearly finished.

17:45.149 --> 17:46.933
Ooh, look at that one!

17:47.017 --> 17:50.236
The anaerobic organisms from
the gastrointestinal tract

17:50.321 --> 17:52.889
have started the microbial
proliferation.

17:52.940 --> 17:54.891
Wow, isn't this amazing?

17:54.942 --> 17:56.058
No.

17:56.110 --> 17:58.394
And that is nasty. Okay.

17:58.446 --> 17:59.446
Ah.

17:59.530 --> 18:02.449
Here's a decomp-in-garbage
scenario.

18:02.533 --> 18:04.417
Oh! Look over
here, Booth!

18:04.502 --> 18:06.903
Hey. Okay. They must
be establishing

18:06.971 --> 18:10.173
baseline timetables for decay

18:10.240 --> 18:12.675
in a damp setting
with direct sunlight.

18:12.743 --> 18:13.743
He swallow a rat?

18:13.811 --> 18:15.178
His stomach's moving.

18:15.245 --> 18:16.629
Booth, get back! Get back! Whoa!

18:22.920 --> 18:24.270
Fantastic!

18:24.355 --> 18:25.522
Did you see that,
Dr. Brennan?

18:25.589 --> 18:27.857
I did. You rarely
get to actually

18:27.925 --> 18:30.527
see a body rupture
from distension.

18:31.812 --> 18:33.363
Oh, um, Professor
Peter Simpkins,

18:33.430 --> 18:35.782
this is my partner,
Special Agent Seeley Booth.

18:35.866 --> 18:37.600
Whoa, that smell.

18:37.651 --> 18:38.935
That would be a combination

18:38.986 --> 18:40.870
of bile and the gases
from his digestive tract.

18:40.938 --> 18:42.438
Hi, I'm-I'm Norman Hayes,
PhD candidate.

18:42.490 --> 18:44.610
It's, uh, quite a thrill
to meet you, Dr. Brennan.

18:44.635 --> 18:45.835
Of course.

18:45.876 --> 18:47.083
Thinking maybe we could
move down a little bit?

18:47.108 --> 18:48.077
Oh, of course! Of course.

18:48.078 --> 18:50.130
Uh, I understand you
recovered the feet

18:50.214 --> 18:51.498
of our seven flood victims.

18:51.582 --> 18:52.448
Well, we found another pair.

18:52.500 --> 18:53.883
Another pair?

18:53.951 --> 18:55.284
Evidence suggests

18:55.336 --> 18:56.803
that the victim originated

18:56.887 --> 18:59.339
in the same location
as your remains.

18:59.423 --> 19:01.224
Do you think someone was
murdered here at the Farm?

19:01.291 --> 19:03.092
Ooh, still a little
stenchy, you know?

19:03.144 --> 19:04.844
Oh, of course.
Of course.

19:04.929 --> 19:07.847
Uh, we need to examine the area
that was affected by the flood.

19:07.932 --> 19:10.233
Oh, uh, Norman can show you
around after we talk.

19:10.300 --> 19:12.519
Uh, that'd be an honor.

19:15.105 --> 19:17.023
Dr. Filmore.
Yes.

19:17.107 --> 19:19.809
Hey. I'm Dr. Lance Sweets.
I'm a psychologist with the FBI.

19:19.860 --> 19:21.477
Oh. So now that
Dr. Brennan has her feet,

19:21.529 --> 19:23.746
did she send you down here to
pronounce me mentally unfit?

19:23.814 --> 19:25.832
No. No, no.
I-I'm just here on my own

19:25.900 --> 19:27.700
to see if I could
be of any help.

19:27.785 --> 19:29.335
You know, you're coming
into a new environment...

19:29.420 --> 19:30.603
And you heard about my arm,

19:30.671 --> 19:31.838
and as a psychologist,
you're fascinated.

19:31.922 --> 19:33.640
No, I...
I'm used to it, Dr. Sweets.

19:33.707 --> 19:37.093
But I've seen psychologists,
psychiatrists, neurologists,

19:37.160 --> 19:39.712
rheumatologists and no one's
been able to provide an answer.

19:39.797 --> 19:41.831
And I-I don't mean
to be brusque,

19:41.882 --> 19:44.217
but I need to get back to work.

19:46.787 --> 19:48.521
Perhaps the psychologists
you were seeing

19:48.606 --> 19:50.390
weren't as familiar
with Dr. Brennan as I am.

19:50.474 --> 19:52.775
You know,
her seeming insensitivity

19:52.843 --> 19:55.478
and emotional cruelty
are merely her way

19:55.529 --> 19:58.281
of dealing with an
inability to understand

19:58.348 --> 20:00.066
or empathize with
the feelings of other people.

20:00.150 --> 20:01.350
And you think

20:01.402 --> 20:03.736
if I feel sorry for her, my
arm will get better. No.

20:03.821 --> 20:06.072
No, I just meant that,
you know, a clear understanding

20:06.156 --> 20:07.974
of the situation
might be beneficial.

20:10.628 --> 20:12.528
All right,
I know you need to work,

20:12.580 --> 20:16.216
but if you want to talk,
I'll be in my office.

20:23.540 --> 20:24.874
<i>The St. Regis hadn't flooded</i>

20:24.925 --> 20:27.043
that badly in 400 years.
Ideally,

20:27.094 --> 20:28.711
we wouldn't have projects
so close to the river,

20:28.762 --> 20:31.047
- but we're running out of usable land.
- Why's that?

20:31.098 --> 20:32.482
Once a body

20:32.549 --> 20:35.235
has decomposed in a particular
area, it needs to lie fallow

20:35.302 --> 20:36.703
before the next

20:36.770 --> 20:38.021
decomp scenario
can be introduced.

20:38.072 --> 20:40.556
Oh. Excuse me. Brennan.

20:40.608 --> 20:42.959
We ID'd the victim.
I traced the

20:43.027 --> 20:44.777
serial number on his sneakers.

20:44.862 --> 20:46.446
Wait, sneakers have
serial numbers?

20:46.530 --> 20:47.997
Well, the $2,000 kind do.

20:48.065 --> 20:51.668
Booth, the victim had
sneakers worth $2,000.

20:51.735 --> 20:53.953
$2,000? That's more
than my first car.

20:54.038 --> 20:55.939
They were bought by a kid named

20:56.006 --> 20:57.323
Dylan McEllroy.

20:57.391 --> 20:59.292
He was a U of H grad student.

20:59.376 --> 21:01.427
Okay. Thanks, Ange.
You bet.

21:01.495 --> 21:04.271
Are you familiar with a student
named Dylan McEllroy?

21:04.272 --> 21:06.323
Yes. He's in our graduate program.
He...

21:08.018 --> 21:09.102
Oh, my God, he's the decedent?

21:09.186 --> 21:11.571
I thought he'd dropped out.

21:11.639 --> 21:14.256
Any idea how he can afford $2,000 sneakers?
I don't know.

21:14.308 --> 21:16.559
Dylan could've been wearing
lamb chops on his feet,

21:16.610 --> 21:18.945
but unless they were
decomposing, I really...

21:19.029 --> 21:20.129
wouldn't notice.

21:20.197 --> 21:22.615
This is horrible.

21:25.202 --> 21:27.370
<i>Dylan's roommate</i>

21:27.437 --> 21:29.438
is a kid by the name
of Kent Durham.

21:29.490 --> 21:31.958
Okay, up next, a
pair of, uh, low-profile,

21:32.042 --> 21:33.993
super limited edition Air
Glides, released only in Japan.

21:34.078 --> 21:36.045
Bidding starts at $300.

21:36.113 --> 21:38.214
We got $300 right here,
$300. How about $320?

21:38.281 --> 21:40.717
We got $340. $360, anybody?
$340.

21:40.784 --> 21:42.669
$360. Three... $360 right here.
How about $380?

21:42.753 --> 21:43.970
$380.
$380?

21:44.054 --> 21:45.171
Do I hear $400?

21:45.255 --> 21:46.255
$400.

21:46.307 --> 21:47.840
$400 right here.
Going once,

21:47.925 --> 21:50.343
going twice. Sold, to the dude
in the yellow hoodie.

21:50.427 --> 21:52.178
Step right up, don't be shy.

21:52.262 --> 21:53.930
We got limited edition
Quick Strikes,

21:53.981 --> 21:55.848
uh, one of a kind.
Okay, next item

21:55.933 --> 21:57.517
is a pair of Platinum Kick Pros.

21:57.601 --> 22:00.019
Bidding starts at, uh, $150.

22:00.104 --> 22:01.187
What's your name, kid?

22:01.271 --> 22:03.189
Why?
Why?

22:03.273 --> 22:06.159
'Cause the federal government
wants to know why. That's why.

22:06.243 --> 22:08.111
Uh, Kent Durham.
Kent Durham.

22:08.162 --> 22:09.645
Right, Kent, these shoes belong

22:09.697 --> 22:11.748
to, uh, Dylan McEllroy,
by any chance?

22:11.815 --> 22:13.950
Can I get back to you on that?

22:14.001 --> 22:15.168
Sneakers would be

22:15.252 --> 22:17.537
a novel motive
for murder, Booth.

22:17.621 --> 22:18.671
Murder?

22:18.756 --> 22:20.073
Dylan is dead.

22:20.140 --> 22:21.507
Okay, wait.

22:21.592 --> 22:22.959
Th-this is not
what it looks like.

22:23.010 --> 22:25.094
What it looks like to me is
you're trying to sell off

22:25.162 --> 22:26.929
your dead roommate's
shoe collection.

22:27.998 --> 22:29.515
Okay, it is what it looks like.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.551
It-it's just not what you think.

22:40.131 --> 22:41.831
You have to admit, this
looks pretty suspicious.

22:41.883 --> 22:43.800
Look, Dylan was two months
late on his rent.

22:43.851 --> 22:45.051
I was just selling the shoes

22:45.136 --> 22:46.686
to get the money
that he owed me.

22:46.771 --> 22:48.472
The variety is fascinating.

22:48.523 --> 22:51.224
I-I suspect it signifies
tribal allegiance.

22:51.309 --> 22:53.310
Oh, there's a definite
demarcation of status

22:53.361 --> 22:55.612
and hierarchy
depending on brand and model.

22:55.679 --> 22:57.531
Let's just circle back
to your murdered roommate.

22:57.615 --> 22:58.899
Okay? So...

22:58.983 --> 23:00.066
why didn't you
report him missing?

23:00.151 --> 23:01.401
I didn't know that he was.

23:01.486 --> 23:03.320
He used to disappear for weeks
on his sneaker trips.

23:03.371 --> 23:04.788
Japan, Australia...
you name it.

23:04.855 --> 23:06.373
And I've been staying
with my girlfriend.

23:06.457 --> 23:09.292
Look, all I know is that Dylan
owed me a ton of cash

23:09.360 --> 23:11.044
and he-he stiffed me
on a computer

23:11.128 --> 23:12.462
and a speaker system
that I sold him.

23:12.530 --> 23:13.630
Where'd he get this money?

23:13.698 --> 23:15.048
Okay, look.

23:15.132 --> 23:17.000
I had nothing to do with it.
I swear.

23:17.051 --> 23:19.553
With what?
He probably kept the stuff

23:19.637 --> 23:20.587
in the room, but...

23:20.671 --> 23:21.871
what was I supposed to do?

23:21.923 --> 23:24.174
I'm not a cop.
I just stayed out of his way.

23:24.225 --> 23:25.809
Right. He was dealing drugs.

23:29.313 --> 23:31.765
The mite silk we found
on the feet and sneakers

23:31.849 --> 23:33.850
came from
the <i>Oligonychus ilicis.</i>

23:33.901 --> 23:35.852
Mmm. That silk
is like Velcro.

23:35.903 --> 23:37.237
Any particulate
would bind to it.

23:37.305 --> 23:39.022
Exactly. So I pulled
multiple samples,

23:39.073 --> 23:41.775
and I ran it through the
scanning electron microscope.

23:41.843 --> 23:43.076
That looks like pollen.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.946
<i>Cannabis sativa</i> pollen.

23:46.030 --> 23:47.497
Marijuana.

23:47.565 --> 23:50.667
So, they're harvesting more
than bodies at the Body Farm.

23:50.734 --> 23:52.035
Yeah, the victim certainly was.

23:52.086 --> 23:53.420
Booth said he was dealing drugs.

23:53.504 --> 23:55.088
Now we know where he
was growing them.

23:56.424 --> 23:58.008
So, uh, you at home here?

23:58.075 --> 23:59.342
I mean, anything you need?

23:59.410 --> 24:00.627
Oh, no. No, thanks. I'm fine.

24:00.711 --> 24:03.513
Thank you.

24:05.132 --> 24:07.183
You're in America now.

24:07.251 --> 24:09.469
It's okay
to get pissed at Dr. B.

24:09.554 --> 24:11.254
She can take it.

24:13.107 --> 24:14.224
Thank you.

24:19.930 --> 24:21.565
You forged Michelle's
application

24:21.616 --> 24:23.033
and applied to Columbia?

24:23.100 --> 24:26.870
Could you not say that
as though I killed three people?

24:26.937 --> 24:28.405
Come on.
Did you consider the person

24:28.456 --> 24:30.307
that didn't get in
because you cheated?

24:30.374 --> 24:31.958
All right.
I'm a terrible person.

24:32.043 --> 24:33.710
I stipulate to that.

24:33.777 --> 24:35.345
But that's not why I'm here.

24:35.413 --> 24:36.463
You're kidding.

24:36.547 --> 24:38.231
What I need is your advice

24:38.299 --> 24:41.635
on how to tell Michelle
that she has the option of going

24:41.719 --> 24:44.170
to one of the best universities
in the world.

24:44.255 --> 24:45.972
Unfairly and illegitimately.

24:46.057 --> 24:48.975
I'd rather not put it
to her that way.

24:49.060 --> 24:51.094
I can't help you.
Why not?

24:51.145 --> 24:53.680
Some sort of professional
code of ethics?

24:53.764 --> 24:56.182
No, my own personal
code of ethics.

24:56.267 --> 24:58.385
You should consider putting one
together of your own.

24:58.452 --> 24:59.920
Shut up.

24:59.987 --> 25:01.087
Excuse me?

25:01.155 --> 25:03.189
You know,
you have never had to put

25:03.274 --> 25:05.825
someone else's well-being
ahead of your own. Not ever.

25:05.910 --> 25:07.160
Well, I am a mother, okay,

25:07.244 --> 25:09.579
and if I have to get
my hands dirty

25:09.647 --> 25:12.815
to get my child ahead,
then I will.

25:14.368 --> 25:16.319
What kind of example
are you setting for Michelle?

25:31.218 --> 25:32.469
What are you looking for?

25:32.520 --> 25:34.554
You know, if you don't mind
my asking.

25:34.639 --> 25:36.473
Cannabis.
Any suggestions?

25:36.524 --> 25:38.808
No.

25:38.859 --> 25:40.360
Wait. I mean,
you're-you're the FBI,

25:40.444 --> 25:41.844
so is this, like, entrapment?

25:41.896 --> 25:42.896
Oh, never mind.

25:42.980 --> 25:44.481
Just tell me where
the flood was, will you?

25:46.684 --> 25:48.151
It was right here.
Each section is allocated

25:48.202 --> 25:49.653
for a decomp scenario.

25:49.704 --> 25:51.154
That's a lot of rotting.

25:51.205 --> 25:53.957
We have over 60 active
bodies at any one time.

25:54.024 --> 25:55.325
Who are you?

25:55.376 --> 25:56.576
Mr. Wolfram.

25:56.661 --> 25:58.328
I'm the cadaver technician.

25:58.379 --> 25:59.462
Groundskeeper.

25:59.530 --> 26:01.414
Potato, potah-to.
I get rid

26:01.499 --> 26:03.166
of the bodies
once they're done with them.

26:03.217 --> 26:04.884
And I tidy up the place,
make repairs.

26:04.952 --> 26:07.504
Like I said, groundskeeper.

26:07.555 --> 26:09.973
Then, you can dispose of your
own damn cadaver next time.

26:10.040 --> 26:11.708
Pissant.

26:12.843 --> 26:14.877
Uh, so, um,

26:14.929 --> 26:16.680
everything past here
got washed out.

26:16.731 --> 26:18.982
You worked with Dylan.
What was he like?

26:19.049 --> 26:21.884
Truth? Uh... he was
a self-centered dilettante

26:21.936 --> 26:23.553
who squeaked by with Cs and Bs

26:23.604 --> 26:25.438
because all he cared about
were his stupid sneakers.

26:25.523 --> 26:27.440
You feel the same way about him

26:27.525 --> 26:28.775
while he was still
alive two months ago?

26:30.161 --> 26:31.745
Well, if you're asking
whether I killed him,

26:31.829 --> 26:33.246
I couldn't even if I wanted to.

26:33.330 --> 26:35.615
I-I did a semester abroad
at the University of Helsinki.

26:35.700 --> 26:37.450
I just got back three weeks ago.

26:37.535 --> 26:39.619
That's impressive.

26:39.704 --> 26:40.920
Thank you.

26:45.843 --> 26:49.896
So does everybody who works with
Dr. Brennan end up in therapy?

26:49.964 --> 26:52.298
If it's any consolation,
she spent three years

26:52.383 --> 26:54.718
degrading the entire field
of psychology

26:54.769 --> 26:56.469
and essentially dismissing
my life's work

26:56.554 --> 26:58.338
as a foolish waste of time.

26:59.440 --> 27:01.474
And yet, all your limbs work.

27:01.559 --> 27:03.560
Perhaps your arm
is a manifestation

27:03.611 --> 27:06.813
that you accepted what
Dr. Brennan said is correct.

27:06.897 --> 27:08.815
Do you feel that she's
correct about you?

27:08.883 --> 27:10.984
Well, no. Of course not.

27:11.068 --> 27:13.102
But I have no recourse.

27:13.154 --> 27:15.605
Have you ever considered
confronting her,

27:15.673 --> 27:18.241
expressing the anger
you must feel?

27:19.293 --> 27:21.511
Dr. Hodgins suggested that.

27:21.579 --> 27:24.297
Did you come to me
for permission?

27:24.381 --> 27:27.717
Confrontation's not
a natural state for me.

27:27.785 --> 27:31.137
I'm... Canadian.

27:31.222 --> 27:34.908
Canadian... or afraid?

27:40.347 --> 27:42.232
Know anything
about Dylan's business?

27:42.299 --> 27:44.851
I didn't take out thousands
of dollars in student loans

27:44.935 --> 27:47.320
to do drugs or hang
around people who do.

27:47.404 --> 27:48.905
Well, according
to Angela's geo-link,

27:48.972 --> 27:51.558
the cannabis was right here.

27:53.611 --> 27:55.578
Right.
Dissolution of the cartilage

27:55.646 --> 27:57.146
in the upper vertebrae.

27:57.198 --> 27:59.365
Must have been there
for eight days.

27:59.450 --> 28:01.034
All right,
nothing like a couple acres

28:01.118 --> 28:03.837
of rotting corpses to keep
the weed thieves away, right?

28:11.328 --> 28:12.378
What are you doing, Bones?

28:12.463 --> 28:15.665
Loading these pictures
up to the SkyDrive

28:15.716 --> 28:17.934
for Hodgins to analyze.
Why?

28:18.001 --> 28:20.987
I think it might be the mite
silk he found in the remains.

28:21.055 --> 28:22.856
So Dylan was killed here?

28:22.940 --> 28:24.891
In his own pot field.

28:24.975 --> 28:27.110
But Professor Simpkins
inspects all the projects daily.

28:27.177 --> 28:30.113
I-I... I mean, he had
to have seen these plants.

28:37.625 --> 28:38.792
Look, man, I had no idea

28:38.859 --> 28:40.960
marijuana was growing
at the Body Farm.

28:41.074 --> 28:43.342
I find it difficult
to believe the plants,

28:43.409 --> 28:45.511
which can affect decomposition,
went unnoticed by you.

28:45.578 --> 28:47.012
I was short-staffed.

28:47.080 --> 28:48.347
Norman was in Finland.

28:48.414 --> 28:49.848
Finland.
Well, my gut tells me,

28:49.916 --> 28:51.416
if I get a search warrant,
I'm definitely

28:51.468 --> 28:53.302
going to find weed
that came from that patch.

28:55.105 --> 28:56.722
Won't be necessary.

28:58.091 --> 29:00.192
Dylan and I had an arrangement.

29:00.259 --> 29:02.861
I let him grow,
he gave me free product.

29:02.929 --> 29:03.979
"Product."

29:04.064 --> 29:05.731
Okay, so when we asked you
how Dylan

29:05.799 --> 29:07.783
could afford $2,000 sneakers,
you lied.

29:07.867 --> 29:10.736
Look, if the university
finds out, I'll be fired.

29:10.787 --> 29:12.604
I do important work here.

29:12.655 --> 29:14.790
He's right. He does.
Yeah, he also lies.

29:14.874 --> 29:16.325
The only reason
I didn't tell you

29:16.409 --> 29:19.828
was that I thought maybe you'd
think it was me who killed him.

29:19.913 --> 29:22.614
I mean, it seems silly now
that it's all out in the open.

29:22.665 --> 29:24.650
Not to me.

29:34.644 --> 29:36.361
Did you find anything?

29:36.429 --> 29:37.896
Indeed, I did.

29:37.964 --> 29:40.199
Here. Check this out.

29:40.266 --> 29:42.718
It's on our SkyDrive.

29:42.786 --> 29:44.520
Okay. Now, these are the photos

29:44.587 --> 29:46.455
Dr. Brennan took
of the marijuana leaves.

29:46.523 --> 29:48.373
These are all the bugs

29:48.441 --> 29:50.526
I identified
from the mite silk.

29:50.610 --> 29:52.911
Now, yes, some of
these little creatures

29:52.979 --> 29:55.197
are consistent with
what you would find

29:55.281 --> 29:57.349
in a marijuana-based ecosystem.

29:57.417 --> 29:59.501
But there are dozens
of other species

29:59.569 --> 30:01.570
that would normally not
be attracted

30:01.638 --> 30:03.505
to a dead body or marijuana.

30:03.590 --> 30:04.556
Look at this.

30:04.624 --> 30:05.758
The drone fly.

30:05.825 --> 30:07.259
The green tea ant.

30:07.326 --> 30:09.378
Way out of their zip code.

30:09.462 --> 30:11.146
So why'd those guys
come to the party?

30:11.214 --> 30:13.248
Same reason anyone else does:
the food.

30:13.316 --> 30:15.284
But what I can't figure out is:

30:15.351 --> 30:17.269
what type of food would attract

30:17.336 --> 30:20.005
so many different species?

30:20.056 --> 30:21.223
You're going to check
the contents

30:21.307 --> 30:22.574
of their tiny little
bug stomachs

30:22.642 --> 30:23.826
now, aren't you?

30:23.893 --> 30:25.744
You betcha. Want to help?

30:25.812 --> 30:27.446
No. No.

30:32.035 --> 30:33.535
Hey.
Oh, Miss Montenegro.

30:33.620 --> 30:35.788
I have found something
quite... quite interesting.

30:35.855 --> 30:37.372
Now, the dimensions

30:37.457 --> 30:40.042
of the anterior aspect
of the left navicular

30:40.126 --> 30:43.245
are three millimeters less
than the right.

30:43.329 --> 30:45.080
My God.
Mmm.

30:45.165 --> 30:47.032
How did you even notice that?

30:47.083 --> 30:50.185
Well, when you have the kind
of intimate connection

30:50.253 --> 30:51.570
I have with feet, you notice

30:51.638 --> 30:54.189
any irregularities
that might compromise them.

30:54.257 --> 30:55.390
Right.

30:56.893 --> 30:58.710
Oh, I-I don't mean to imply
that I'm a podophile.

30:58.761 --> 31:00.596
Excuse me?
A foot fetishist.

31:00.663 --> 31:02.547
You know, although I appreciate

31:02.599 --> 31:03.899
the beauty of feet

31:03.983 --> 31:06.151
and the intricate nature
of their construction,

31:06.219 --> 31:10.272
I have no desire to...
to lick them or paint them or...

31:10.356 --> 31:12.107
Okay, that's...
Okay. All right.

31:12.192 --> 31:13.909
Okay. All right.

31:13.993 --> 31:18.396
So don't a lot of people
have, uh, skeletal asymmetry?

31:18.448 --> 31:19.731
Oh. Yes.

31:19.782 --> 31:21.967
Which is why Dr. Brennan
probably missed it.

31:22.035 --> 31:24.336
She doesn't spend a lot of
time on feet, I imagine.

31:24.403 --> 31:26.288
Not important enough for her.

31:26.356 --> 31:27.756
Oh. Snap.

31:27.841 --> 31:29.625
Oh, no, no. No, no, no.

31:29.709 --> 31:32.127
No, I-I merely meant
that this isn't genetic.

31:32.212 --> 31:35.180
See, some kind of blade
shaved a small sliver of bone

31:35.248 --> 31:37.516
off the navicular,
and it was obviously

31:37.583 --> 31:39.768
a much sharper blade than the
one that severed his talus,

31:39.853 --> 31:41.303
judging by the striae.
Wait a minute.

31:41.371 --> 31:44.439
Dylan was attacked
with two different weapons?

31:44.524 --> 31:46.358
Oh, yeah, I know.
I was surprised, too.

31:46.425 --> 31:49.478
Also, these are non-fixed
radius striae, which indicate

31:49.546 --> 31:51.780
that both blades
were straight and rigid.

31:51.865 --> 31:53.815
And the cuts display
smooth walls, which means

31:53.900 --> 31:56.118
that the amount of force
necessary to do such a thing...

31:56.202 --> 31:57.920
Dictates a power tool.

31:57.987 --> 31:59.271
Or two power tools,

31:59.322 --> 32:00.622
since we're talking
about two different blades.

32:00.707 --> 32:02.274
Wow.

32:02.325 --> 32:04.376
That was seriously impressive.

32:05.912 --> 32:08.130
You Americans can be
quite enthusiastic.

32:08.214 --> 32:09.965
Some of you.

32:11.784 --> 32:14.169
<i>So what did Dr. Footsie say?</i>

32:14.254 --> 32:16.088
It seems that the victim

32:16.139 --> 32:18.006
was killed with some kind
of power tool.

32:19.058 --> 32:21.126
That's good, right?

32:21.177 --> 32:22.344
Mmm.
Yeah.

32:22.428 --> 32:24.646
Couldn't give the guy
some props for that?

32:24.731 --> 32:28.734
No, I said that his discovery
might have value.

32:28.801 --> 32:30.635
But you know that it does.

32:30.687 --> 32:31.687
You know that.

32:31.771 --> 32:32.905
You just don't want
someone like him

32:32.972 --> 32:34.323
to be as good as
someone like you.

32:34.407 --> 32:35.857
With feet.

32:35.942 --> 32:37.826
Just feet. I get it.

32:37.911 --> 32:39.661
I get it.

32:39.746 --> 32:42.814
But, you know, you really
should apologize to him.

32:42.865 --> 32:44.199
I already explained.

32:44.284 --> 32:46.318
I know you did, but come
on, Bones, he's hurting.

32:46.369 --> 32:47.703
All right? Whether
you're right or wrong,

32:47.787 --> 32:49.321
you leveled the guy.

32:49.372 --> 32:51.156
He's a grown man.

32:51.207 --> 32:53.875
Sometimes that
makes it hurt more.

32:53.960 --> 32:55.877
What makes us human, Bones,

32:55.962 --> 32:59.181
is that we can feel
compassion and regret.

33:01.834 --> 33:04.436
Why is it so important
to you, Booth?

33:04.503 --> 33:06.671
Because I know the kind
of person that you are,

33:06.723 --> 33:11.109
and I think you should let other
people in on the secret, too.

33:13.896 --> 33:16.231
Right?

33:23.153 --> 33:25.554
These are the
tools from the Body Farm.

33:25.622 --> 33:27.222
So do you want me to
input the blade profiles

33:27.274 --> 33:30.008
into the imaging software?
Not necessary.

33:30.063 --> 33:31.964
But Dr. Brennan sent
all of these back here...

33:32.015 --> 33:33.399
I realize that.

33:33.466 --> 33:35.568
And I'd hate it if anyone
went to unnecessary trouble

33:35.635 --> 33:37.987
but we know that cuts
to the feet were made

33:38.071 --> 33:39.638
by two different blades, and

33:39.690 --> 33:42.325
the blow to the talus
cut off the right foot.

33:42.409 --> 33:44.577
And the blow to the navicular
was vertical,

33:44.644 --> 33:46.829
parallel to the bone.

33:46.914 --> 33:49.532
Two separate injuries
made by two different blades.

33:49.616 --> 33:50.983
Judging by the damage
to the bone,

33:51.034 --> 33:54.253
two separate blades
with identical force profiles.

33:54.321 --> 33:58.291
So whoever killed our victim
used two circular saws,

33:58.342 --> 34:00.126
both applied
with equal pressure?

34:00.177 --> 34:01.811
Which is impossible.
Exactly.

34:01.879 --> 34:06.365
Which is why I posit
the blades were connected.

34:06.433 --> 34:07.717
Yes.

34:07.801 --> 34:09.802
Looks like opposing propellers.

34:09.870 --> 34:12.338
How would something like that
cut him off horizontally

34:12.389 --> 34:14.357
at one ankle and vertically
at the other?

34:14.440 --> 34:16.943
Well, because he started
standing up.

34:17.010 --> 34:19.145
One of the blades cut him off
at the ankle,

34:19.196 --> 34:20.346
and he fell down.

34:20.397 --> 34:21.981
The blade ran him over,

34:22.032 --> 34:23.866
taking a slice off
the navicular.

34:24.918 --> 34:26.953
In going over the particulates

34:27.020 --> 34:30.706
that Dr. Hodgins found on
the remains,

34:30.791 --> 34:32.742
I noticed grass.

34:32.826 --> 34:33.659
Yes, marijuana.

34:33.710 --> 34:34.827
Hmm?

34:34.878 --> 34:37.196
Oh, yes, also regular grass:

34:37.246 --> 34:39.031
fescue and bluegrass.

34:39.081 --> 34:40.800
Which means?

34:40.867 --> 34:42.668
It's a riding mower.

34:42.719 --> 34:44.237
Oh, my God!

34:44.304 --> 34:45.638
The victim was killed

34:45.706 --> 34:48.975
by someone on a
ride-on lawn mower.

34:49.042 --> 34:51.643
The blades severed
the plantar arteries,

34:51.712 --> 34:54.197
and he bled out.

34:54.264 --> 34:56.482
Filmore, you did it!

34:56.549 --> 34:59.151
You're a genius!

34:59.219 --> 35:00.386
Oh!

35:00.437 --> 35:03.406
Bug news. Big bug news.

35:03.490 --> 35:06.525
All of the bugs that we found
on the pot leaves,

35:06.577 --> 35:09.178
they all ingested this food gel
that's used by reptile breeders.

35:09.246 --> 35:11.563
It's an insect super food.

35:11.615 --> 35:14.066
Bugs smell this, they come
flying from miles around.

35:14.117 --> 35:16.568
I also found traces of it
on the sneakers.

35:16.620 --> 35:18.170
Of course.
This is so exciting.

35:18.238 --> 35:19.905
Really? Why?

35:19.957 --> 35:23.092
The killer covered Dylan's body
in the gel.

35:23.176 --> 35:25.261
It would have exponentially
increased insect activity.

35:25.345 --> 35:26.429
Hastening decomposition

35:26.513 --> 35:28.764
and completely obscuring
time of death.

35:28.849 --> 35:31.350
So we would get
time of death wrong.

35:31.418 --> 35:32.584
But wait, wouldn't everyone

35:32.636 --> 35:35.521
at that Body Farm
know how to use that?

35:35.588 --> 35:38.391
Yes, but from what Booth said,
only one of them had an alibi

35:38.442 --> 35:40.592
for what we thought
was time of death.

35:40.644 --> 35:44.280
I'm guessing,
because he knew he'd need one.

35:49.953 --> 35:53.122
There was no trace of blood
on the blades

35:53.206 --> 35:54.991
because they'd recently
been cleaned with bleach.

35:55.075 --> 35:56.959
How many times
do I have to tell you guys?

35:57.044 --> 35:59.045
I was in Helsinki
when Dylan was murdered.

35:59.112 --> 36:00.579
You were back for
three weeks, right?

36:00.631 --> 36:02.632
Yes. Check my travel records,
okay?

36:02.716 --> 36:03.833
The university in Finland.

36:03.917 --> 36:05.951
I mean, there is no way
I could have killed him.

36:06.003 --> 36:10.973
Unless Dylan actually died
two weeks ago, Norman,

36:11.058 --> 36:12.791
and not two months ago.

36:12.843 --> 36:16.162
Right, see, there's a
receipt here with your name on it

36:16.229 --> 36:18.931
for two gallons
of Gro-Fast bug food.

36:18.982 --> 36:20.766
That sped up decomp

36:20.817 --> 36:22.485
and gave you the perfect alibi.

36:22.569 --> 36:24.303
Really think you were smarter
than Bones here?

36:26.740 --> 36:29.458
Dylan contaminated your body
with his marijuana field.

36:29.526 --> 36:32.311
That was your thesis project.

36:32.362 --> 36:34.747
Simpkins said you'd
been working on it for a year,

36:34.814 --> 36:37.833
and Dylan comes along
and ruins it with his weed.

36:37.918 --> 36:40.336
"Shallow Grave
Decomposition in Barren Soil."

36:40.420 --> 36:42.672
Quite an impressive project,
actually.

36:42.756 --> 36:44.707
Barren soil.

36:51.782 --> 36:55.384
I get back from Helsinki,

36:55.469 --> 36:59.655
and his weed had spread
right over my remains.

36:59.723 --> 37:02.508
$60,000 in student loans

37:02.559 --> 37:04.110
and I was gonna flunk
because of him.

37:04.177 --> 37:06.112
You think that's right?

37:06.179 --> 37:08.147
No, but killing him was worse.

37:08.198 --> 37:10.816
I didn't mean to.

37:13.036 --> 37:17.373
I got the mower
to cut it all down.

37:21.194 --> 37:23.829
And he... he tried to stop me.

37:23.880 --> 37:27.450
I told him to move.

37:29.886 --> 37:31.470
But he didn't.

37:38.562 --> 37:41.013
I kept thinking he would move.

37:51.858 --> 37:53.325
I'm sorry.

I used yours.

38:18.751 --> 38:20.419
I tarted it up a little.

38:20.470 --> 38:23.072
Quoted Montaigne,
David Foster Wallace.

38:24.241 --> 38:25.191
They're writers.

38:25.258 --> 38:27.092
I know they're writers.

38:27.144 --> 38:28.561
I'm just...

38:28.612 --> 38:30.362
You're telling me that

38:30.430 --> 38:34.066
if I wanted to,
I could simply go

38:34.117 --> 38:35.568
to Columbia University
in the fall?

38:35.619 --> 38:38.270
Yes.

38:38.321 --> 38:39.955
Mmm...

38:41.992 --> 38:44.610
Oh...

38:45.962 --> 38:47.946
I see what's going on here.

38:47.998 --> 38:49.114
Oh, thank God.

38:49.166 --> 38:50.282
I just-I just...

38:50.333 --> 38:52.585
I want what's best for you.

38:52.636 --> 38:54.937
I know you do,
which is why you're testing me.

38:55.005 --> 38:56.121
What?

38:56.173 --> 38:57.173
Well, surprise.

38:57.257 --> 38:58.724
I've learned a lot from you.

38:58.791 --> 39:02.461
I've learned to try hard
and not take shortcuts.

39:04.898 --> 39:07.466
I've learned it's wrong
to cheat.

39:07.517 --> 39:10.069
Oh, really?

39:10.136 --> 39:12.404
But what are you gonna do?

39:12.472 --> 39:14.490
Here's what I'll do:

39:14.574 --> 39:16.408
I'll work for a year
and make money

39:16.476 --> 39:18.777
and I'll take extra courses,

39:18.829 --> 39:22.615
and I'll get into Columbia
on my own and make you proud.

39:23.650 --> 39:25.668
You already have.

39:25.752 --> 39:27.837
I want to be just like you.

39:27.921 --> 39:29.538
That's sweet,

39:29.623 --> 39:31.707
but I think you should aim
a little higher.

39:33.493 --> 39:35.044
♪ Tonight... ♪

39:38.148 --> 39:40.165
<i>It was wonderful meeting
you,</i> <i>Dr. Sweets.</i>

39:40.217 --> 39:42.017
I've enjoyed my visit.

39:42.102 --> 39:43.919
And you're leaving a hero.

39:43.987 --> 39:45.187
Oh, I'd hardly say.

39:45.272 --> 39:47.339
I know. That's why I did.

39:49.693 --> 39:51.477
So did you talk to Dr. Brennan?

39:52.979 --> 39:54.313
Oh, no.

39:54.364 --> 39:56.198
But if you really care
about your arm,

39:56.283 --> 39:57.283
I seriously recommend...

39:57.350 --> 39:58.684
Dr. Filmore.

39:58.735 --> 40:01.987
What now?

40:02.038 --> 40:04.657
Have I embarrassed you
in some way, Dr. Brennan?

40:04.708 --> 40:06.659
I know the only reason

40:06.710 --> 40:08.077
I was here
was because you wanted

40:08.161 --> 40:09.128
the feet that I possessed.

40:09.195 --> 40:10.546
Dr. Filmore...
Do you deny it?

40:10.614 --> 40:13.349
Was it my expertise you sought
when you called?

40:13.416 --> 40:14.967
No,

40:15.034 --> 40:17.336
it wasn't.

40:18.805 --> 40:20.973
You are brilliant, Dr. Brennan,

40:21.040 --> 40:24.226
I won't deny it,
but you are also

40:24.311 --> 40:27.329
a close-minded
and a thoughtless person.

40:29.215 --> 40:30.382
Yes, I have heard that before

40:30.433 --> 40:31.817
which is why I wanted to address

40:31.884 --> 40:34.937
the issue of the article
I wrote in the journal.

40:35.021 --> 40:36.138
Oh.

40:36.206 --> 40:38.557
While I don't believe
that forensic podiatry

40:38.608 --> 40:41.260
should be recognized
as a separate specialty,

40:41.328 --> 40:45.080
I was remiss in my article
not to have noted

40:45.148 --> 40:47.249
your remarkable skill

40:47.334 --> 40:49.702
and expertise.

40:49.753 --> 40:53.038
You are exceptional,
and I strongly doubt

40:53.106 --> 40:57.909
we would have solved this case
without your help.

40:57.961 --> 40:59.545
For that, I am very grateful...

41:01.214 --> 41:04.934
...and pleased to have had the
opportunity to work with you.

41:10.523 --> 41:12.424
Dr. Filmore.

41:14.311 --> 41:15.761
Oh!

41:15.812 --> 41:17.146
Oh, no, I'm so sorry.
Sweets, what were you...?

41:17.230 --> 41:19.448
Well, no,
I thought his arm would work.

41:19.532 --> 41:20.866
Don't trouble yourself.
I shouldn't have been...

41:20.933 --> 41:22.234
I shouldn't have been
in the way.

41:22.285 --> 41:23.569
I'm fine,

41:23.620 --> 41:25.187
I think.

41:31.611 --> 41:33.912
It works.

41:37.617 --> 41:39.802
Look at that.

41:45.291 --> 41:47.292
I'm glad that you
apologized to the Canadian.

41:47.344 --> 41:48.794
I'm proud of you, Bones.

41:48.845 --> 41:51.296
I didn't apologize.
I thought...

41:51.348 --> 41:52.398
The word "apology" derives

41:52.465 --> 41:54.767
from the Ancient Greek
<i>"apologia"</i>

41:54.818 --> 41:56.402
which means
"a speech in defense."

41:56.469 --> 41:58.187
When I defended
what I said to him,

41:58.271 --> 41:59.938
you told me that wasn't
a real apology.

41:59.990 --> 42:03.492
Why don't you think of a word
that means you feel bad

42:03.560 --> 42:05.728
for making someone
else feel bad?

42:05.795 --> 42:07.696
Contrite.
Ah!

42:07.781 --> 42:09.581
From the Latin <i>"contritus"</i>

42:09.649 --> 42:12.468
meaning
"crushed by a sense of sin."

42:12.535 --> 42:15.654
There. That's it. Contrite.

42:15.705 --> 42:18.173
Okay, I'm happy that you
contrited to the Canadian.

42:18.258 --> 42:20.109
Would you like to hear
some more things

42:20.176 --> 42:21.293
that I feel contrite about?

42:21.361 --> 42:22.261
There's more?

42:22.328 --> 42:23.545
Yes.

42:23.630 --> 42:26.392
I feel contrite that I think
your socks are silly.

42:26.417 --> 42:27.064
What?

42:27.089 --> 42:30.506
Also I am contrite that
I think you are foolhardy

42:30.531 --> 42:32.026
in the way you
approach your cup of coffee.

42:32.051 --> 42:33.632
How do I approach
a cup of coffee.

42:33.657 --> 42:35.903
You drink it without
checking the temperature

42:35.928 --> 42:38.637
and then you complain all day
that your tongue is burned.

42:38.662 --> 42:40.716
I feel contrite that I...

42:41.197 --> 42:42.097
I think that's stupid.

42:42.100 --> 42:45.002
Let's recap, okay.
Foolhardy and stupid.

42:45.630 --> 42:46.830
There' more.

42:47.096 --> 42:48.517
Bones, you don't have
to apologize

42:48.542 --> 42:49.985
for things that you think.

42:50.250 --> 42:51.350
Oh!

42:51.368 --> 42:54.334
Believe me, if we had to be sorry
for every, single thought...

42:54.359 --> 42:56.185
Like what?
Uh, believe me I'm not gonna

42:56.210 --> 42:57.360
fall down that path.

42:57.365 --> 42:59.439
You know, I might say something
I'm gonna regret later.

42:59.464 --> 43:01.706
- No way.
- Regret. The word regret...

43:01.826 --> 43:04.592
derives from the old french
<i>"regreter..."</i>
