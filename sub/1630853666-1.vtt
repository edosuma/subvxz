WEBVTT

00:15.619 --> 00:17.619
- <i> Bringing you</i>
<i>Center Four...</i>

01:23.456 --> 01:26.424
- <i> The shadow that you seen</i>
<i>was bipedal,</i>

01:26.459 --> 01:29.955
<i>and it almost looked like a...</i>
<i>like a giant canine.</i>

01:29.990 --> 01:33.926
<i>It didn't have any...you know,</i>
<i>human features to it.</i>

01:33.961 --> 01:36.929
Seven, eight feet tall,
very broad-shouldered,

01:36.964 --> 01:38.601
and it had this...

01:38.636 --> 01:39.965
and it had this...

01:40.803 --> 01:42.033
canine-looking head.

01:46.512 --> 01:48.138
- <i> I remember</i>

01:48.173 --> 01:51.251
<i>it was a dog-like creature.</i>

01:51.286 --> 01:56.817
<i>To this day, I can distinctly</i>
<i>remember hearing the footsteps.</i>

01:56.852 --> 02:01.624
Bipedal footsteps on the gravel,
and it was shuffling.

02:03.122 --> 02:06.761
- <i> This thing</i>
<i>emerges from the corn,</i>

02:06.796 --> 02:08.796
<i>and it was about six feet tall,</i>

02:08.831 --> 02:11.205
<i>it had the head of a dog,</i>

02:11.240 --> 02:12.965
<i>high-pointed ears,</i>

02:13.000 --> 02:16.210
<i>it's shoulders were...</i>
<i>were rolled, and it's arms</i>
<i>were long,</i>

02:16.245 --> 02:19.576
and I remember it just,
turned its head

02:19.611 --> 02:21.006
like this and looked at me.

02:27.685 --> 02:30.917
- <i> I've faced</i>
<i>predators.</i>

02:30.952 --> 02:33.623
<i>Most of your big game predators</i>

02:33.658 --> 02:35.361
<i>that you have in the States.</i>

02:35.396 --> 02:36.824
These things don't act
like that.

02:36.859 --> 02:38.826
You look in these things' eyes,

02:40.368 --> 02:43.160
<i>these things look like they're</i>
<i>trying to figure you out.</i>

02:43.195 --> 02:44.667
<i>They look like they're looking</i>
<i>through you,</i>

02:44.702 --> 02:46.207
<i>trying to figure out what</i>
<i>your next move is.</i>

02:47.441 --> 02:49.606
<i>So they can get around it.</i>

02:49.641 --> 02:52.136
<i>I've been around predators</i>
<i>my whole life,</i>

02:52.171 --> 02:54.512
<i>and I've never seen anything</i>
<i>in my life like that.</i>

04:30.038 --> 04:32.511
So the history of werewolf

04:32.546 --> 04:36.416
and Dogman sightings
is... is ancient.

04:36.451 --> 04:40.145
We have to look at the
Greek myths first,

04:40.180 --> 04:42.587
uh, to come up with the
word "lycanthropy".

04:46.494 --> 04:48.285
- <i> And from</i>
<i>that time on,</i>

04:48.320 --> 04:50.892
<i>we have now had</i>
<i>part of our vernacular</i>

04:50.927 --> 04:52.663
<i>the word "lycanthrope".</i>

04:52.698 --> 04:56.326
<i>And the Greeks were very aware</i>

04:56.361 --> 04:58.295
<i>that werewolves existed.</i>

04:58.330 --> 05:00.506
<i>So when we look at the word</i>
<i>"werewolf" as well,</i>

05:00.541 --> 05:01.738
<i>or you know the word "were"</i>

05:01.773 --> 05:04.334
<i>W-E-R, comes from</i>
<i>the Middle Ages.</i>

05:04.369 --> 05:06.039
<i>And it simply means, "man".</i>

05:06.074 --> 05:08.173
<i>So you have a man-wolf.</i>

05:08.208 --> 05:10.879
<i>We see also, even</i>
<i>in the Viking culture,</i>

05:10.914 --> 05:14.179
<i>you know, a few thousand</i>
<i>years later, 2000 years later,</i>

05:14.214 --> 05:17.116
<i>whenever they</i>
<i>would dress in the furs</i>

05:17.151 --> 05:19.954
<i>of particular animals</i>
<i>of which they wanted</i>
<i>to emulate.</i>

05:19.989 --> 05:24.354
<i>The name "Berserker" comes</i>
<i>from those that wore</i>
<i>bear hides.</i>

05:24.389 --> 05:28.666
<i>But also there were the Vikings</i>
<i>that wore the furs of a wolf,</i>

05:28.701 --> 05:30.833
<i>and they were called</i>
<i>the "drinkers of blood".</i>

05:30.868 --> 05:34.298
<i>Because they believed</i>
<i>that they were able to assume</i>

05:34.333 --> 05:39.006
<i>that animal's form, that</i>
<i>animal's ferocity in battle.</i>

05:43.210 --> 05:45.012
<i>Sightings historically,</i>

05:45.047 --> 05:47.883
I think are often amalgamated
with Bigfoot sightings,
unfortunately.

05:47.918 --> 05:50.215
Because, we didn't really have

05:50.250 --> 05:54.351
<i>the differential type of</i>
<i>comparison and contrast</i>
<i>with the Dogman.</i>

05:54.386 --> 05:56.056
<i>I think and just up</i>
<i>until recently,</i>

05:56.091 --> 05:58.894
<i>people were seeing what</i>
<i>they call "Dogman",</i>
<i>or, "werewolf."</i>

05:58.929 --> 06:02.359
<i>More, because now we have that</i>
<i>as part of our language.</i>

06:02.394 --> 06:04.438
<i>But I think a lot of times</i>
<i>when people were talking</i>

06:04.473 --> 06:07.034
about being confronted by
a Bigfoot,

06:07.069 --> 06:10.543
<i>or encountering a Bigfoot that</i>
<i>was acting aggressively.</i>

06:10.578 --> 06:13.205
<i>A lot of those reports</i>
<i>that I'm looking at,</i>

06:13.240 --> 06:15.944
<i>I am now thinking,</i>
<i>are more in the realm</i>

06:15.979 --> 06:19.585
<i>of the Dogman, werewolf,</i>
<i>sightings than a typical</i>
<i>Bigfoot sighting.</i>

06:21.281 --> 06:24.524
It's always seemed like Dogman
is a bit aggressive in nature,

06:24.559 --> 06:26.988
because you hear so many stories
of people that see it,

06:27.023 --> 06:28.792
and it chases them out of
an area,

06:28.827 --> 06:30.464
or it bites them.

06:30.499 --> 06:33.830
There are multiple sightings
up from here in the region
where...

06:33.865 --> 06:35.634
- <i> people</i>
<i>just see it running across</i>
<i>the trail</i>

06:35.669 --> 06:38.769
<i>or it doesn't chase them,</i>
<i>you...you know, they'll</i>
<i>just see it.</i>

06:38.804 --> 06:40.298
<i>It's like every encounter</i>
<i>you hear</i>

06:40.333 --> 06:42.234
<i>that they're described</i>
<i>just a little bit different.</i>

06:42.269 --> 06:45.611
People say it looked like
the werewolf from the movie
<i>Silver Bullet.</i>

06:45.646 --> 06:47.437
<i>Or you'll hear somebody say,</i>

06:47.472 --> 06:49.274
<i>"Well, uh,</i>
<i>the legs and the arms</i>

06:49.309 --> 06:50.781
<i>looked like a canine,</i>
<i>but it...</i>

06:50.816 --> 06:52.310
<i>stood up on two legs</i>

06:52.345 --> 06:55.280
<i>it kind of had a coyote head,</i>
<i>but it was much larger."</i>

06:55.315 --> 06:56.721
<i>So, it's a...</i>

06:56.756 --> 06:58.118
it's a little strange
in that way,

06:58.153 --> 06:59.559
you hear a lot of
different types.

06:59.594 --> 07:01.957
They all seem to differ,
in some little manner.

07:04.060 --> 07:06.456
- <i> So anywhere</i>
<i>in the Midwest,</i>

07:06.491 --> 07:08.458
I mean, it just makes
perfect sense.

07:08.493 --> 07:10.262
And there's...there's
a lot of cover.

07:10.297 --> 07:11.428
I mean, there's still...

07:11.463 --> 07:13.705
uh, in the Midwest and
Central America.

07:13.740 --> 07:14.805
There's... North America,

07:14.840 --> 07:16.334
- <i> there's a lot of...</i>

07:16.369 --> 07:19.238
<i>wide open spaces and a lot</i>
<i>of woods.</i>

07:19.273 --> 07:23.649
<i>And a lot of places where</i>
<i>a single person jogging down</i>
<i>a road,</i>

07:23.684 --> 07:26.344
<i>looks like a tasty, tasty meal.</i>

07:26.379 --> 07:27.653
<i>If that's...</i>

07:27.688 --> 07:29.248
<i>If that's what their intent is,</i>

07:29.283 --> 07:31.448
<i>or if their intent is...</i>

07:31.483 --> 07:33.318
<i>"Just stay away from</i>
<i>where we're guarding.</i>

07:33.353 --> 07:36.596
<i>We don't want you, you know,</i>
<i>we don't want you messing...</i>

07:36.631 --> 07:38.664
<i>with what... what we're</i>
<i>protecting."</i>

07:49.710 --> 07:52.645
<i>Bucyrus, as I understand,</i>

07:52.680 --> 07:55.472
<i>was founded in</i> <i> 1821.</i>

07:55.507 --> 07:59.652
<i>Uh, it was given</i>
<i>the name "Bucyrus",</i>
<i>by Colonel James Kilbourne.</i>

08:01.986 --> 08:04.184
<i>I don't know what his interest</i>
<i>was in Bucyrus,</i>

08:04.219 --> 08:07.825
<i>but, we're forever cursed</i>
<i>with a name, that nobody</i>
<i>could pronounce.</i>

08:09.125 --> 08:10.795
<i>Yeah, it's been around</i>
<i>a long time.</i>

08:13.866 --> 08:14.997
<i>Grew up here? Yep.</i>

08:15.032 --> 08:17.670
<i>North of town, out</i>
<i>in the country.</i>

08:17.705 --> 08:20.530
<i>It's a quiet... existence</i>
<i>growing up, because,</i>

08:20.565 --> 08:21.905
<i>because, I mean,</i>

08:21.940 --> 08:24.171
<i>Bucyrus is a small town.</i>

08:24.206 --> 08:25.535
<i>But I grew up...</i>

08:25.570 --> 08:27.878
<i>very rural... like nine miles</i>
<i>outside of town.</i>

08:32.687 --> 08:35.545
<i>So, you know, we visited</i>
<i>our grandparents in town,</i>

08:35.580 --> 08:39.956
<i>and it was a nice Middle</i>
<i>America small town.</i>

08:39.991 --> 08:41.991
Leave It To Beaver<i> could have</i>
<i>been filmed...</i>

08:42.026 --> 08:43.894
<i>you know, on one</i>
<i>of the streets.</i>

08:43.929 --> 08:44.862
<i>Uh...</i>

08:44.897 --> 08:47.260
<i>Just a nice place to grow up.</i>

08:47.295 --> 08:49.900
- <i> People, you know,</i>
<i>the...the people here,</i>

08:49.935 --> 08:52.496
are pretty... down-to-earth
people.

08:52.531 --> 08:53.838
You know, we have, uh,

08:53.873 --> 08:56.434
essentially a makeup of people
who was born here,

08:56.469 --> 08:59.613
and a lot of people
that migrated from Kentucky.

09:02.442 --> 09:04.508
<i>As a kid,</i>

09:04.543 --> 09:06.950
<i>you know, my grandparents</i>
<i>would tell us</i>

09:06.985 --> 09:09.854
<i>stories about a creature that</i>

09:09.889 --> 09:13.253
<i>that they refer to</i>
<i>as the Bobo.</i>

09:13.288 --> 09:15.486
<i>Bobo...The other thing</i>
<i>I can figure, Bobo</i>

09:15.521 --> 09:17.191
<i>was some sort of...</i>

09:17.226 --> 09:21.459
<i>some sort of, you know,</i>
<i>bipedal... you know, hominid.</i>

09:21.494 --> 09:23.901
<i>And then they also told us</i>
<i>a story about a creature</i>

09:23.936 --> 09:26.299
<i>by the name of</i>
<i>Raw Head and Bloody Bones.</i>

09:26.334 --> 09:28.334
<i>Which, I had no idea</i>
<i>what that was,</i>

09:28.369 --> 09:31.711
<i>but I presumed it was some</i>
<i>version of the Boogeyman.</i>

09:31.746 --> 09:33.713
<i>And so years later, when</i>
<i>you have the Internet,</i>

09:33.748 --> 09:35.275
<i>I've... I've actually looked</i>
<i>it up,</i>

09:35.310 --> 09:38.212
<i>and, uh, my grandmother</i>
<i>on my mother's side</i>

09:38.247 --> 09:40.786
<i>came from the Tennessee area.</i>

09:40.821 --> 09:42.414
<i>Uh, in North Carolina,</i>

09:42.449 --> 09:44.020
<i>in that mountainous area there.</i>

09:44.055 --> 09:46.253
<i>And it turns out that Raw</i>
<i>Head and Bloody Bones</i>

09:46.288 --> 09:49.795
<i>date all the way back</i>
<i>to 15th Century England.</i>

09:49.830 --> 09:51.225
<i>And you know,</i>

09:51.260 --> 09:53.227
<i>immigrants came over, and the</i>
<i>stories came over</i>

09:53.262 --> 09:55.966
<i>and over the years, "Be careful</i>
<i>going to the woods.</i>

09:56.001 --> 09:57.198
<i>"The Bobo'll getcha.</i>

09:57.233 --> 09:59.101
<i>Raw Head and Bloody Bones</i>
<i>will get you."</i>

09:59.136 --> 10:00.674
<i>You know, things like that.</i>

10:00.709 --> 10:03.303
My parents were no-nonsense.

10:03.338 --> 10:05.503
Uh, my dad would have never...

10:05.538 --> 10:08.781
even entertained the idea
of a ghost

10:08.816 --> 10:12.752
or some sort of monster
running around.

10:12.787 --> 10:14.688
- <i> It was a different time</i>

10:14.723 --> 10:17.086
<i>uh, growing up in the '70s.</i>

10:17.121 --> 10:19.990
<i>Uh, people, especially in</i>
<i>rural America,</i>

10:20.025 --> 10:22.223
<i>the... that was</i>
<i>nonsense to them.</i>

10:22.258 --> 10:23.422
<i>So</i> ...

10:23.457 --> 10:24.962
<i>I mean, there's</i>
<i>no other way to put it.</i>

10:24.997 --> 10:27.734
<i>And my... probably my dad's</i>
<i>solution would have been,</i>

10:27.769 --> 10:30.660
<i>"Hey, if there's a dog,</i>
<i>a Dogman or Bigfoot out there,</i>
<i>we'll just shoot it."</i>

10:30.695 --> 10:32.904
You know werewolves were...

10:32.939 --> 10:36.666
...Lon Chaney Jr. On TV8.

10:36.701 --> 10:39.845
- <i> And that's</i>
<i>my reference to werewolves.</i>

10:39.880 --> 10:42.606
<i>Was, you know,</i>
<i>the werewolf, Lon Chaney Jr.</i>

10:42.641 --> 10:44.146
<i>With the...torn plaid shirt,</i>

10:44.181 --> 10:45.983
<i>and the flat face,</i>

10:46.018 --> 10:49.349
and running around, grabbing
women and running off with them.

10:56.523 --> 11:00.767
My encounter happened
way back in 1972,

11:00.802 --> 11:02.769
between
Yellow Springs and Clifton.

11:11.307 --> 11:15.012
- <i> It started out as a...</i>
<i>most likely a Friday night,</i>

11:15.047 --> 11:17.674
<i>because I was allowed</i>
<i>to be out on Friday nights.</i>

11:17.709 --> 11:20.116
<i>I was about 17 at the time.</i>

11:20.151 --> 11:22.822
<i>Out with the boyfriend,</i>

11:22.857 --> 11:25.550
and another couple,
we had two different...

11:25.585 --> 11:27.926
we had two cars, two sets of us,

11:27.961 --> 11:30.830
and... well, you know
how kids are.

11:30.865 --> 11:33.899
We were out going to "park".

11:35.727 --> 11:39.872
- <i> We, uh, go down</i>
<i>the road, and the bridge</i>
<i>is totally out,</i>

11:39.907 --> 11:41.104
<i>there's just the barricade.</i>

11:41.139 --> 11:43.667
<i>So, we...</i>

11:43.702 --> 11:47.539
<i>turn around and make sure</i>
<i>that both of the vehicles</i>
<i>are facing out.</i>

11:47.574 --> 11:49.673
<i>So if the cops come along,</i>

11:49.708 --> 11:51.543
<i>you know, "We were just</i>
<i>leaving anyway.</i>

11:51.578 --> 11:52.885
<i>-"No big deal."</i>

11:54.515 --> 11:56.416
<i>Really, really dark.</i>

11:56.451 --> 11:58.154
<i>It was probably...</i>

11:58.189 --> 11:59.991
<i>it was cloudy, I don't know.</i>

12:01.753 --> 12:03.555
<i>There were no leaves</i>
<i>on the trees.</i>

12:04.426 --> 12:06.129
<i>But it wasn't real cold,</i>

12:06.164 --> 12:09.231
<i>so it was a perfect night</i>
<i>to be standing out</i>
<i>and laughing.</i>

12:13.633 --> 12:16.106
<i>I was leaning on...</i>

12:16.141 --> 12:18.372
<i>the car with my boyfriend.</i>

12:18.407 --> 12:20.979
<i>Nice muscle car,</i>
<i>back then.</i>

12:21.014 --> 12:22.882
<i>So I'm leaning...</i>

12:22.917 --> 12:24.774
<i>We're talking with</i>
<i>the other couple</i>

12:24.809 --> 12:26.248
<i>who's leaning on...</i>

12:26.283 --> 12:28.019
<i>their car, I don't know how</i>
<i>long we'd been there,</i>

12:28.054 --> 12:31.253
<i>maybe 15-20 minutes?</i>

12:34.995 --> 12:38.392
<i>There was gravel on the</i>
<i>berm of the road.</i>

12:38.427 --> 12:40.064
<i>And now remember, this is...</i>

12:40.099 --> 12:42.231
<i>just one way in and</i>
<i>one way out,</i>

12:42.266 --> 12:43.430
<i>because the bridge is out.</i>

12:45.467 --> 12:47.874
<i>Well, there's gravel</i>
<i>on the berm.</i>

12:47.909 --> 12:51.405
<i>There's a brush row next</i>
<i>to a creek,</i>

12:51.440 --> 12:53.913
<i>and I see</i>

12:53.948 --> 12:57.312
<i>eye shine,</i>
<i>meaning an animal,</i>

12:57.347 --> 12:59.985
<i>up in the trees,</i>
<i>or so I'd thought.</i>

13:01.846 --> 13:03.681
<i>I mentioned out,</i>

13:03.716 --> 13:06.486
<i>"I wonder if that's a possum,</i>
<i>or a raccoon,</i>
<i>or what's up there?"</i>

13:07.753 --> 13:09.357
<i>And then...</i>

13:09.392 --> 13:11.293
<i>something walked out.</i>

13:12.131 --> 13:14.032
<i>And it wasn't a possum,</i>

13:14.067 --> 13:16.364
<i>it wasn't a raccoon.</i>
<i>It was a...</i>

13:17.367 --> 13:18.498
<i>a creature.</i>

13:18.533 --> 13:20.500
<i>I have no idea</i>

13:20.535 --> 13:24.108
<i>at the time what it was,</i>
<i>nor did anyone else.</i>

13:24.143 --> 13:29.113
<i>To this day, I can distinctly</i>
<i>remember hearing the...</i>

13:29.148 --> 13:32.380
rustling of the gravel
that's on the berm.

13:34.989 --> 13:37.121
- <i> And... there's this</i>
<i>dark creature.</i>

13:37.156 --> 13:38.584
<i>It wasn't huge.</i>

13:40.357 --> 13:43.226
<i>Maybe five foot,</i>
<i>five and a half foot...</i>

13:43.261 --> 13:46.262
<i>six to eight feet away</i>
<i>from me.</i>

13:46.297 --> 13:48.627
<i>When it was in the, uh, weeds,</i>

13:48.662 --> 13:50.200
<i>it had its mouth closed,</i>

13:50.235 --> 13:52.466
<i>its eyes were amber,</i>

13:52.501 --> 13:55.139
<i>almond, sort of almond-shape.</i>

13:55.174 --> 13:59.539
The ears were very,
very close to the head.

13:59.574 --> 14:02.641
- <i> Pointed straight up,</i>
<i>but they weren't real</i>
<i>long ears,</i>

14:02.676 --> 14:04.247
<i>but they were pointed</i>
<i>straight up.</i>

14:09.881 --> 14:12.992
- <i> My belief...</i>
<i>it was August of 1985.</i>

14:13.027 --> 14:16.424
<i>Um, at that time,</i>
<i>there was a friend</i>
<i>of the family,</i>

14:16.459 --> 14:18.624
<i>who, when I was</i>
<i>a high school athlete,</i>

14:18.659 --> 14:20.230
<i>and he had asked me if</i>
<i>I'd wanted</i>

14:20.265 --> 14:21.594
<i>to get into a fitness program,</i>

14:21.629 --> 14:23.794
<i>a running program,</i>
<i>to be in shape.</i>

14:23.829 --> 14:25.532
<i>I said, "Sure."</i>

14:25.567 --> 14:29.943
<i>So the plan was that I was</i>
<i>going to go out and run</i>
<i>five miles</i>

14:30.605 --> 14:32.110
<i>in the evening.</i>

14:32.145 --> 14:36.048
<i>I lived on State Route 4,</i>
<i>North 4381.</i>

14:36.083 --> 14:38.809
<i>At that time,</i>
<i>really the only place</i>
<i>for me to run</i>

14:38.844 --> 14:41.911
<i>was this little side road,</i>
<i>just south</i>

14:41.946 --> 14:44.089
<i>of my house</i>
<i>called Temple Road.</i>

14:45.994 --> 14:47.686
<i>If my memory serves</i>
<i>me correctly,</i>

14:47.721 --> 14:49.754
<i>I was going to try</i>
<i>to get running at,</i>
<i>like, eight o'clock.</i>

14:49.789 --> 14:52.526
<i>And then I procrastinated,</i>
<i>and this happened and</i>
<i>that happened.</i>

14:52.561 --> 14:55.199
<i>And by the time I was actually</i>
<i>ready to go run,</i>

14:55.234 --> 14:56.398
<i>it was dark.</i>

14:56.433 --> 14:58.235
<i>You know, I was a country boy.</i>

14:58.270 --> 15:00.039
<i>You know, I...I was</i>
<i>never afraid of the dark.</i>

15:00.074 --> 15:02.272
<i>So going out and running down</i>
<i>a country road at night,</i>

15:02.307 --> 15:04.703
<i>didn't bother me at all.</i>

15:04.738 --> 15:07.508
<i>I left my house, it was</i>
<i>probably little after nine,</i>

15:07.543 --> 15:09.950
<i>and it just... it had just</i>
<i>gotten dark.</i>

15:10.744 --> 15:12.183
<i>But it was a very clear night.</i>

15:12.218 --> 15:13.580
<i>I mean, it was really clear,</i>

15:13.615 --> 15:14.779
<i>visibility was good.</i>

15:14.814 --> 15:16.913
<i>I start down Temple Road,</i>

15:16.948 --> 15:19.883
<i>and at that time,</i>
<i>on the right hand side,</i>

15:19.918 --> 15:21.951
<i>which would be</i>
<i>the north side of the road,</i>

15:21.986 --> 15:24.426
<i>there was corn,</i>
<i>on the left side,</i>

15:24.461 --> 15:26.296
<i>which should be</i>
<i>the south side of Temple Road,</i>

15:26.331 --> 15:27.726
<i>it was all beans.</i>

15:27.761 --> 15:30.795
<i>And it stayed like that</i>
<i>all the way for one mile.</i>

15:30.830 --> 15:31.895
<i>So...</i>

15:31.930 --> 15:34.337
<i>I made it down the</i>
<i>State Route 19,</i>

15:34.372 --> 15:35.800
<i>and I was on my way back,</i>

15:35.835 --> 15:39.342
<i>and as I approached Flickinger</i>
<i>Road on the way back,</i>

15:39.377 --> 15:41.839
<i>which meant that I had</i>
<i>one mile to go,</i>

15:42.710 --> 15:44.776
<i>I got this weird feeling.</i>

15:44.811 --> 15:46.712
<i>It's this kind of feeling that</i>

15:46.747 --> 15:48.681
<i>you know, something's wrong,</i>

15:48.716 --> 15:51.189
<i>and you know, there's...</i>
<i>something's watching you.</i>

15:51.818 --> 15:53.323
<i>And...</i>

15:53.358 --> 15:56.788
<i>I felt like it was coming</i>
<i>from those woods, so I stopped.</i>

15:56.823 --> 15:59.626
<i>I don't know why I stopped,</i>
<i>but I stopped,</i>

15:59.661 --> 16:01.364
<i>and I looked into the woods...</i>

16:02.466 --> 16:03.828
<i>and I didn't see anything.</i>

16:03.863 --> 16:06.930
<i>I...I didn't hear anything,</i>
<i>I didn't see anything.</i>

16:06.965 --> 16:09.306
<i>As I was about to start</i>
<i>running again,</i>

16:09.341 --> 16:12.705
<i>in the cornfield, I see</i>
<i>the corn start moving.</i>

16:15.380 --> 16:16.874
<i>-Whatever it was...</i>

16:16.909 --> 16:21.318
<i>...it was really big because</i>
<i>a lot of corn was moving.</i>

16:21.353 --> 16:23.221
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>a lot of corn is moving,</i>

16:23.256 --> 16:25.289
<i>and then all of a sudden,</i>
<i>it stopped.</i>

16:25.324 --> 16:27.720
<i>And I thought, "Wow, that's</i>
<i>strange."</i>

16:27.755 --> 16:29.194
<i>And so I said, "Well,</i>
<i>I'mma get out of here."</i>

16:29.229 --> 16:31.460
<i>So I take off running,</i>

16:31.495 --> 16:33.528
<i>and when I took off running</i>

16:33.563 --> 16:35.332
<i>whatever was in the corn...</i>

16:35.367 --> 16:37.796
<i>takes off running, too.</i>

16:37.831 --> 16:40.469
And that's what startled me,
really,

16:40.504 --> 16:42.702
because that's not
how deer behave.

16:42.737 --> 16:44.176
Deer gets, you know,

16:44.211 --> 16:45.639
deer gets scared or
they get startled,

16:45.674 --> 16:47.707
or they get surprised,
and they just take off running.

16:47.742 --> 16:50.842
But this thing started
running with me.

16:50.877 --> 16:52.580
And when I say it started
running with me,

16:53.154 --> 16:55.154
it was pacing me.

16:55.189 --> 16:57.189
- <i> It...and it kind of</i>
<i>freaked me out,</i>

16:57.224 --> 16:59.323
<i>so I stopped.</i>

16:59.358 --> 17:01.523
<i>And when I stopped...</i>

17:01.558 --> 17:03.195
<i>it stopped.</i>

17:03.230 --> 17:06.198
<i>To this day,</i>
<i>I think it would've</i>
<i>had to been, at least</i>

17:06.233 --> 17:08.233
<i>three rows in.</i>

17:08.268 --> 17:11.863
<i>And so I remember</i>
<i>stopping thinking,</i>

17:11.898 --> 17:14.206
<i>'How does it know</i>
<i>that I stopped?'</i>

17:14.241 --> 17:17.638
<i>So I stood there,</i>
<i>and as I stood there,</i>
<i>staring at the corn,</i>

17:17.673 --> 17:19.805
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>not a single stalk moved.</i>

17:19.840 --> 17:22.280
<i>I mean, it was perfectly,</i>
<i>just still.</i>

17:22.315 --> 17:24.282
<i>Like this thing that was</i>
<i>in the corn,</i>

17:24.317 --> 17:27.681
<i>like it was just</i>
<i>perfectly still.</i>

17:27.716 --> 17:29.815
<i>And I don't know how long</i>
<i>I stood there,</i>

17:29.850 --> 17:31.850
<i>but it spooked me.</i>

17:31.885 --> 17:34.226
<i>And... not knowing what it was,</i>

17:34.261 --> 17:35.887
<i>I said, "That's it, I'm taking</i>
<i>off."</i>

17:35.922 --> 17:37.053
<i>So...</i>

17:37.088 --> 17:38.758
<i>and when I took off,</i>

17:38.793 --> 17:41.057
<i>it takes off simultaneously.</i>

17:41.433 --> 17:42.696
<i>and...</i>

17:42.731 --> 17:45.094
<i>it's pacing me, and</i>
<i>I start running faster,</i>

17:45.129 --> 17:46.799
<i>and it starts running faster.</i>

17:48.407 --> 17:51.573
<i>I realize...</i>
<i>this thing's stalking me.</i>

17:51.608 --> 17:53.476
<i>Whatever...whatever is in</i>
<i>the corn.</i>

17:53.511 --> 17:56.875
I realize when I get to Route 4,

17:56.910 --> 17:59.581
I'm going to have to
turn left to go home.

17:59.616 --> 18:02.518
And I'm just...assuming
this thing stays in the corn.

18:02.553 --> 18:03.915
- <i> Assuming it did.</i>

18:03.950 --> 18:05.950
<i>When I get to Route 4 and</i>
<i>I turn left to go home,</i>

18:05.985 --> 18:07.952
<i>I'm gonna run right into it,</i>
<i>I'm going to intersect with it.</i>

18:08.757 --> 18:10.262
<i>And...</i>

18:10.297 --> 18:13.760
One of my best friends who lived
just down the road from me,

18:14.400 --> 18:16.499
he was to the right.

18:16.534 --> 18:19.370
So...my thought is "Okay."

18:19.405 --> 18:21.801
"I'm not going to turn left
and go home, because
I don't want this...

18:21.836 --> 18:23.803
I don't want to intersect
with this thing,

18:23.838 --> 18:25.134
so I am going to cut right."

18:25.169 --> 18:26.740
So, I made up my mind.

18:26.775 --> 18:29.611
I was just going to stay
on the road.

18:29.646 --> 18:33.285
And when I get to Route 4,
I'm going to cut right,

18:33.320 --> 18:35.078
I'm gonna run to his house.

18:35.113 --> 18:38.884
So I realized that as
I'm going to get there,

18:38.919 --> 18:41.755
there...I'm gonna run out
of corn.

18:41.790 --> 18:43.460
So whatever is in this corn

18:43.495 --> 18:46.628
is going to come out before
I actually get to Route 4.

18:47.994 --> 18:50.995
So, I told myself, "Don't look."

18:51.030 --> 18:53.569
And the reason why I said,
in my mind,

18:53.604 --> 18:55.208
"Don't look." Because...

18:55.243 --> 18:57.001
I had no idea what it was.

18:57.036 --> 18:59.278
And part of me thought,

18:59.313 --> 19:02.413
"If I looked,
I might freeze up."

19:02.448 --> 19:04.041
I'm coming to the end
of the corn,

19:04.978 --> 19:06.252
and...

19:06.287 --> 19:08.353
I looked,
I couldn't help myself.

19:08.388 --> 19:10.487
I...I...I could not help myself.

19:10.522 --> 19:13.820
As I'm running, I kind of
turned my body like this,

19:13.855 --> 19:15.690
to just kind of, like...

19:15.725 --> 19:17.186
side shuffle,

19:17.221 --> 19:18.990
and that's when I saw it.

19:21.027 --> 19:24.369
This thing emerges from
the corn,

19:24.404 --> 19:26.272
and it was about six feet tall,

19:26.307 --> 19:28.307
because that's how tall
the corn was.

19:29.233 --> 19:30.936
And, it...

19:30.971 --> 19:32.509
had the head of a dog,

19:33.380 --> 19:35.512
<i>high pointed ears.</i>

19:35.547 --> 19:38.878
- <i> And it's shoulders</i>
<i>were rolled like this,</i>

19:38.913 --> 19:42.211
<i>like it had, like, terrible</i>
<i>pos...like a person</i>
<i>with terrible posture.</i>

19:42.246 --> 19:46.655
<i>It's shoulder rolled and</i>
<i>its arms were long,</i>

19:46.690 --> 19:49.823
<i>and, I remember,</i>
<i>it just turned its head</i>

19:49.858 --> 19:51.561
<i>like this and looked at me.</i>

19:53.532 --> 19:56.500
<i>I saw its head,</i>
<i>I saw the ears.</i>

19:56.535 --> 19:59.569
<i>Could I tell you</i>
<i>what color its fur was? No.</i>

19:59.604 --> 20:02.132
<i>It could have been</i>
<i>real dark gray,</i>
<i>it could have been black.</i>

20:02.167 --> 20:03.573
<i>It could have been dark brown.</i>

20:03.608 --> 20:06.708
<i>I can't tell you what color</i>
<i>the fur was for sure.</i>

20:06.743 --> 20:09.843
<i>The interesting thing is,</i>
<i>when I saw it,</i>

20:09.878 --> 20:12.241
I didn't immediately think
werewolf.

20:12.276 --> 20:14.386
I just didn't, because...

20:14.421 --> 20:16.850
as we talked about,
my frame of reference

20:16.885 --> 20:21.624
for what a werewolf was,
was something I had seen on TV8.

20:21.659 --> 20:27.190
It was a man with a flat face,
and it wore torn,
tattered clothes.

20:27.225 --> 20:29.368
It did not look like what I saw.

20:29.403 --> 20:31.832
And the only frame
of reference that I had,

20:31.867 --> 20:35.671
<i>was it looked just</i>
<i>like the Egyptian God, Anubis.</i>

20:35.706 --> 20:37.706
<i>That's the best way</i>
<i>I can describe it.</i>

20:42.075 --> 20:45.747
There was an almost
a crackling feeling.

20:45.782 --> 20:48.211
The hair on the back
of my neck stood up.

20:48.246 --> 20:52.358
Almost like a static,
static electricity, maybe.

20:56.320 --> 21:02.302
- <i> And, I suppose that's</i>
<i>a sixth sense, saying,</i>
<i>"It's time to leave."</i>

21:05.769 --> 21:11.806
I don't know whose voice it was,
and I hear "Let's go, now."

21:11.841 --> 21:15.612
I run around and the creature,

21:15.647 --> 21:18.450
it didn't move like a human.

21:18.485 --> 21:22.619
- <i> Maybe, it moved like</i>
<i>a dog that's walking</i>
<i>on its hind legs.</i>

21:22.654 --> 21:25.820
<i>It almost moved kangaroo-like.</i>

21:25.855 --> 21:29.087
<i>Like the legs were bent</i>
<i>the wrong way.</i>

21:29.122 --> 21:31.991
<i>That's sort of freakier</i>
<i>than about anything,</i>

21:32.026 --> 21:34.532
<i>is to see something that</i>

21:34.567 --> 21:37.634
your mind does not
want to grasp.

21:37.669 --> 21:40.329
And it's on two legs.

21:40.364 --> 21:46.577
- <i> It kind of does</i>
<i>a hop, skipping motion,</i>
<i>not very many feet.</i>

21:46.612 --> 21:50.009
<i>It followed me, which</i>
<i>was no big deal</i>
<i>and it was so close.</i>

21:50.044 --> 21:55.146
<i>It did its hop skipping motion</i>
<i>and I could see it out</i>
<i>of my periphery.</i>

21:55.181 --> 21:57.852
<i>And it followed me</i>
<i>as I ran around.</i>

21:57.887 --> 22:01.988
I managed to get
into my, uh, passenger side.

22:02.023 --> 22:07.290
<i>And, as he pulls off,</i>
<i>because there was so</i>
<i>much gravel,</i>

22:07.325 --> 22:09.930
<i>the gravel</i>
<i>was spinning some,</i>

22:09.965 --> 22:14.165
<i>and it was running</i>
<i>alongside of the car,</i>

22:14.200 --> 22:18.642
<i>looking at me, straight,</i>
<i>you know, straight in the eye.</i>

22:18.677 --> 22:22.008
<i>It's really hard to explain</i>
<i>unless you've ever had</i>

22:22.043 --> 22:25.275
<i>something that maybe</i>
<i>can't be explained.</i>

22:25.310 --> 22:27.849
You know, that's
happened to you.

22:27.884 --> 22:31.457
I simply focused on the eyes
and its movement,

22:31.492 --> 22:34.658
because its movement
was so unusual to me.

22:34.693 --> 22:38.761
I really can't say
how many feet it followed,

22:38.796 --> 22:41.665
hopping along, beside the car.

22:41.700 --> 22:43.865
But, I sort of felt in danger.

22:43.900 --> 22:46.967
I wasn't terrified because

22:47.002 --> 22:50.542
nothing was going into my head
the way it should.

22:50.577 --> 22:55.173
I guess it's what happens
when you encounter something

22:55.208 --> 22:58.451
that you have no parameters
for what it is.

23:01.214 --> 23:04.886
And when I saw it,
I did kind of pause.

23:04.921 --> 23:09.055
I didn't freeze, but I did kind
of pause, and I looked at it.

23:09.090 --> 23:12.058
- <i> Like I said,</i>
<i>there's weeds, wildflowers</i>

23:12.093 --> 23:14.665
<i>and other stuff that runs</i>
<i>right up to the corn.</i>

23:14.700 --> 23:18.361
<i>So all I could see</i>
<i>was from, like, thigh down,</i>

23:18.396 --> 23:20.165
<i>so I don't know what</i>
<i>his feet look like.</i>

23:20.200 --> 23:22.607
<i>I don't know what its knees</i>
<i>look like or anything</i>
<i>like that.</i>

23:23.467 --> 23:25.742
<i>But, I saw its torso.</i>

23:25.777 --> 23:28.173
<i>It... But, when it turned</i>
<i>and looked at me,</i>

23:28.208 --> 23:32.914
<i>it just looked like</i>
<i>it had this massive chest.</i>

23:32.949 --> 23:34.685
<i>So I take off across</i>
<i>Route 4.</i>

23:34.720 --> 23:37.688
<i>So, I'm, I'm gunning it</i>
<i>as fast as I can.</i>

23:37.723 --> 23:41.527
<i>This thing has dropped</i>
<i>to all fours and is chasing me.</i>

23:41.562 --> 23:43.628
<i>As I'm getting closer</i>
<i>to my buddy's house,</i>

23:43.663 --> 23:46.829
<i>I knew that they</i>
<i>had an in-ground pool.</i>

23:46.864 --> 23:49.634
<i>And they had a fence</i>
<i>around, a chain link fence.</i>

23:49.669 --> 23:54.133
<i>But as I'm getting closer,</i>
<i>I look and I see</i>
<i>the gates shut.</i>

23:54.168 --> 23:56.036
<i>I was like, "Oh."</i>

23:56.071 --> 23:58.236
And I know if this thing
is following me,

23:58.271 --> 24:00.612
my only options is,
I'm just going to have
to jump the fence.

24:00.647 --> 24:04.308
- <i> So I jump</i>
<i>and I throw my feet up</i>
<i>like in the air,</i>

24:04.343 --> 24:06.475
<i>like the old Fosbury flop</i>
<i>high jump.</i>

24:06.510 --> 24:09.346
And I put my hand
on the top of the fence
and it was scalloped.

24:09.381 --> 24:10.446
I remember this.

24:10.481 --> 24:12.624
It had those, y'know,
the scallops.

24:12.659 --> 24:15.792
And I pushed it down
and when I did,
and then it popped back up,

24:15.827 --> 24:18.828
it just slashed me
right across my side.

24:18.863 --> 24:23.965
I land in like a stumbling
motion, and I just dive
headfirst into the pool.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.132
- <i> And I'm blowing out</i>
<i>my breath and I am going down</i>

24:26.167 --> 24:30.103
<i>and I can feel it, I can</i>
<i>still feel it, sliding out</i>
<i>the pool. It was ten feet deep.</i>

24:30.138 --> 24:32.171
<i>I'm sliding down.</i>

24:32.206 --> 24:34.844
<i>I blow all the air out</i>
<i>and I get to the bottom.</i>

24:34.879 --> 24:40.685
<i>And I somehow pinch my nose</i>
<i>and I look up and I am fully</i>
<i>expecting to see this thing,</i>

24:40.720 --> 24:43.655
<i>with the rolled shoulders</i>
<i>and the dog head,</i>

24:43.690 --> 24:46.449
<i>and the big chest</i>
<i>sitting on the side</i>
<i>of the pool.</i>

24:48.552 --> 24:51.454
<i>But it seemed like a long time,</i>
<i>I was on the bottom pool</i>
<i>and I'm looking up,</i>

24:51.489 --> 24:52.565
<i>and I'm looking up</i>

24:53.865 --> 24:55.524
<i>and I don't see anything.</i>

24:55.559 --> 24:58.197
<i>So I'm like,</i>
<i>"Oh, my God."</i>

24:58.232 --> 25:00.936
I climb up out of the pool
and I run.

25:00.971 --> 25:04.434
And I rip that door open
as hard as I can.

25:04.469 --> 25:09.307
And my buddy was sitting there,
he screams and I scream.

25:09.342 --> 25:11.474
And I slammed the door.

25:12.180 --> 25:13.542
And I remember screaming,

25:13.577 --> 25:14.983
"Turn the lights out,
turn the lights out."

25:15.986 --> 25:17.656
And he has no idea
what's going on.

25:17.691 --> 25:20.791
So we turn the lights out
and I'm just looking
out the windows.

25:20.826 --> 25:24.388
I'm looking out the windows,
thinking, "Is this thing
out there?"

25:29.098 --> 25:31.868
- <i> The next night,</i>
<i>I played cards with guys</i>

25:31.903 --> 25:33.804
<i>on the basketball team,</i>

25:33.839 --> 25:35.905
and I told them the story.

25:35.940 --> 25:38.204
But I did not tell them
what I saw.

25:38.239 --> 25:42.043
I vividly remember, um,
the next night.

25:42.078 --> 25:43.814
We were at a friend's house.

25:43.849 --> 25:47.543
So we're all in the garage,
outside, playing cards.

25:47.578 --> 25:50.381
It was a... It was a bunch
of us guys, that went
to high school together.

25:50.416 --> 25:53.923
And he's telling the story
about outrunning,

25:53.958 --> 25:57.795
and having something
pacing him in the cornfield.

25:57.830 --> 26:03.867
We... We were all teammates,
and what teammates do is we give
each other a bunch of crap.

26:03.902 --> 26:06.870
He probably already got
enough crap from us as it was,

26:06.905 --> 26:08.971
so he didn't want
to get any more.

26:09.006 --> 26:14.207
And... And you don't want
to be called crazy, y'know,
but he did tell us the story.

26:14.242 --> 26:16.407
I remember the story
and he's asking, like,

26:16.442 --> 26:18.915
"What do you guys
think this was?"

26:18.950 --> 26:23.689
And, nobody had an answer.

26:23.724 --> 26:27.220
- <i> When I did</i>
<i>the research, I found out</i>
<i>that on Flickinger Road</i>

26:27.255 --> 26:29.860
<i>to just down</i>
<i>on Flickinger Road,</i>

26:29.895 --> 26:32.555
<i>is at least two</i>
<i>Indian burial grounds.</i>

26:32.590 --> 26:37.461
<i>So, that made me start</i>
<i>thinking in a, in a totally</i>
<i>different way</i>

26:37.496 --> 26:39.232
<i>than what I always thought.</i>

26:39.267 --> 26:43.236
<i>For years I had thought,</i>
<i>this is a flesh</i>
<i>and blood creature.</i>

26:43.271 --> 26:45.502
<i>That it's wolf-like</i>
<i>or dog-like,</i>

26:45.537 --> 26:48.439
<i>and no one seems</i>
<i>to catch them because</i>
<i>they are really fast.</i>

26:48.474 --> 26:50.749
<i>They're really smart,</i>
<i>they're really stealthy.</i>

26:50.784 --> 26:56.315
Now my mindset has switched
to, um, "I think these
are supernatural creatures."

26:57.483 --> 26:59.351
That's my opinion.

26:59.386 --> 27:03.520
I revisited where this happened
about a year and a half ago.

27:03.555 --> 27:04.829
I hadn't been...

27:04.864 --> 27:08.899
I hadn't been back
in those many, many years.

27:08.934 --> 27:11.627
- <i> I found out there's</i>
<i>Indian mounds there.</i>

27:11.662 --> 27:18.711
<i>Adena Indians, which are very,</i>
<i>were very common in this part</i>
<i>of Ohio.</i>

27:18.746 --> 27:22.407
<i>I've read, where your Dogman,</i>
<i>for some reason,</i>

27:22.442 --> 27:26.279
<i>are found</i>
<i>or seen frequently</i>

27:26.314 --> 27:27.720
<i>where there's Indian mounds,</i>

27:28.613 --> 27:30.184
<i>so I don't know.</i>

27:30.219 --> 27:33.121
<i>Y'know, I just, I don't know</i>
<i>what to say to that.</i>

27:33.156 --> 27:38.060
- <i> If you believe</i>
<i>the aspect of a Dogman,</i>
<i>werewolf creature</i>

27:38.095 --> 27:41.657
<i>being more supernatural</i>
<i>than natural,</i>

27:41.692 --> 27:47.630
<i>you can't hardly go any,</i>
<i>anywhere here and not have</i>
<i>a Native American settlement.</i>

27:47.665 --> 27:53.977
It just lends itself to that
angle of these creatures

27:54.012 --> 27:59.312
<i>being y'know,</i>
<i>the guardians of the Native</i>
<i>American burial mounds,</i>

27:59.347 --> 28:00.610
<i>or grounds.</i>

28:07.322 --> 28:10.719
My name is Adam Davis,
and I've...

28:10.754 --> 28:14.228
After personal experiences,
initially with Dogman,

28:14.263 --> 28:20.531
I've been a researcher since
about, officially since,
about 2005.

28:20.566 --> 28:27.439
The... My initial, actual
sighting was in 2005,
back in October 19th.

28:27.474 --> 28:33.412
<i>After we had initially</i>
<i>started hearing about</i>

28:33.447 --> 28:37.647
<i>different howling</i>
<i>reports of everything</i>
<i>out around</i>

28:37.682 --> 28:40.958
<i>uh, the Germantown</i>
<i>and Liberty, Ohio area.</i>

28:44.458 --> 28:48.196
<i>My girlfriend and I</i>
<i>decided to go out</i>
<i>to Anthony Road and...</i>

28:49.529 --> 28:51.562
<i>And to see if we could find</i>
<i>any tracks.</i>

28:52.598 --> 28:54.400
<i>And as we crossed the bridge,</i>

28:55.843 --> 28:58.107
<i>I was doing my usual thing,</i>

28:58.142 --> 29:00.241
<i>looking down at the sandbars.</i>

29:00.276 --> 29:02.078
<i>Y'know, to see if there</i>
<i>was anything there.</i>

29:02.113 --> 29:04.080
<i>I didn't see any tracks.</i>

29:04.115 --> 29:07.853
<i>Because sometimes we would see</i>
<i>tracks in the sand bars.</i>

29:07.888 --> 29:13.419
<i>And we got across the bridge</i>
<i>and it kind of takes</i>
<i>a little turn.</i>

29:13.454 --> 29:16.752
<i>And down,</i>
<i>down a little downhill.</i>

29:16.787 --> 29:21.394
<i>And, I tell her to stop</i>
<i>because I see something black,</i>

29:21.429 --> 29:24.232
<i>over on the right hand</i>
<i>side of the road.</i>

29:24.267 --> 29:26.102
<i>I was... You know...</i>

29:26.137 --> 29:29.798
<i>I was on the passenger side,</i>
<i>so it was on my side.</i>

29:29.833 --> 29:32.977
<i>And, I was...</i>
<i>Because I was looking</i>
<i>in the mud</i>

29:33.012 --> 29:35.848
<i>and silt and everything,</i>
<i>to see if there was any tracks.</i>

29:39.018 --> 29:43.581
<i>I get out and I go over to it</i>
<i>and I look at it.</i>

29:43.616 --> 29:45.616
<i>And I realize it's an article</i>
<i>of clothing.</i>

29:45.651 --> 29:51.589
<i>It was a pair of pants,</i>
<i>of women's brand of pants,</i>
<i>in a petite size.</i>

29:51.624 --> 29:53.525
<i>And I pick them up</i>
<i>and I'm looking at them.</i>

29:53.560 --> 29:59.564
<i>And there's silt on the back</i>
<i>of the pants from where they</i>
<i>had lain...</i>

29:59.599 --> 30:06.439
<i>lain against the dampness</i>
<i>of the ground, and they were</i>
<i>slightly damp from the rain.</i>

30:06.474 --> 30:12.885
<i>And then I took them and turned</i>
<i>them around, and I realized</i>
<i>that it was...</i>

30:20.026 --> 30:21.487
<i> I realized</i>

30:21.522 --> 30:23.687
<i>that the front of the pants...</i>

30:23.722 --> 30:25.425
<i>were just like,</i>
<i>totally shredded.</i>

30:27.429 --> 30:29.066
<i>And matted with blood.</i>

30:29.101 --> 30:33.499
<i>And it was not dried blood</i>
<i>or anything.</i>

30:33.534 --> 30:35.336
<i>It was just congealing.</i>

30:36.240 --> 30:37.338
<i>I look across the road,</i>

30:38.737 --> 30:42.541
<i>and I see red fabric.</i>

30:42.576 --> 30:46.952
<i>So, I mean, at this point</i>
<i>in time, it was kind of...</i>

30:46.987 --> 30:51.253
<i> And I really</i>
<i>was starting to put together</i>
<i>what I'm seeing.</i>

30:51.288 --> 30:55.521
<i>And, y'know,</i>
<i>as I'm looking at it,</i>
<i>I walk across the road</i>

30:55.556 --> 31:00.130
<i>and I find a sweater and a...</i>
<i>and a T shirt</i>

31:00.165 --> 31:02.198
<i>that are still partially</i>
<i>inside of each other.</i>

31:04.004 --> 31:09.040
I looked... and I looked
at it and there was blood
there on the sweater.

31:09.075 --> 31:11.009
But the T-shirt was worse.

31:11.044 --> 31:13.913
<i>It was shredded</i>
<i>and matted with blood,</i>

31:15.048 --> 31:18.181
<i>and I called the police.</i>

31:18.216 --> 31:21.052
<i>I got ahold of dispatch</i>
<i>and told them what we found.</i>

31:22.220 --> 31:25.287
<i>And, this is what</i>
<i>really kills me.</i>

31:27.093 --> 31:29.291
<i>They laughed it off.</i>

31:29.326 --> 31:33.460
<i>They said, "Oh, it's probably</i>
<i>just someone's trash that,</i>
<i>that they left out there."</i>

31:33.495 --> 31:35.363
<i>It's nothing.</i>
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>

31:38.269 --> 31:42.106
<i>So, I told my girlfriend,</i>
<i>"We're going to go</i>
<i>to the house."</i>

31:42.141 --> 31:44.438
<i>"We're going to get a bag</i>
<i>and come back for this."</i>

31:44.473 --> 31:47.903
<i>Because we didn't have</i>
<i>anything to put it in.</i>

31:47.938 --> 31:52.578
<i>It was maybe ten minutes</i>
<i>from there to the house</i>
<i>and back.</i>

31:52.613 --> 31:55.713
<i>We got back,</i>
<i>those clothes were gone.</i>

31:58.421 --> 32:01.818
<i>They had taken a vehicle</i>
<i>and driven over the places</i>

32:01.853 --> 32:05.756
<i>where those clothes</i>
<i>were laying, where there</i>
<i>was an imprint in the mud,</i>

32:05.791 --> 32:08.924
<i>or any trace of blood</i>
<i>because they were, the...</i>

32:08.959 --> 32:12.631
<i>the sweater and the T-shirt</i>
<i>were laying in...</i>

32:12.666 --> 32:15.172
<i>on the edge of the road</i>
<i>in the, in the tall grass.</i>

32:16.802 --> 32:24.808
<i>In 2015, I wind up meeting up</i>
<i>with this guy from Hamilton.</i>

32:24.843 --> 32:30.451
<i>He was telling us how he had</i>
<i>been, y' know, looking</i>
<i>at anomalous, reports,</i>

32:30.486 --> 32:36.325
<i>and everything, where</i>
<i>he was getting descriptions</i>
<i>of oversize, heeded prints.</i>

32:36.360 --> 32:39.955
<i>He said he was basically</i>
<i>going from house to house,</i>

32:39.990 --> 32:44.300
<i>through the Germantown</i>
<i>dam area, y'know,</i>
<i>where there were...</i>

32:44.335 --> 32:47.303
<i>Where there's houses</i>
<i>along the edge of the park.</i>

32:47.338 --> 32:50.306
<i>And, he came</i>
<i>to this one family</i>

32:50.341 --> 32:54.937
<i>that said that</i>
<i>in 2000... April 2006,</i>

32:54.972 --> 32:58.578
<i>their daughter went out</i>
<i>one morning,</i>
<i>to go out jogging</i>

32:58.613 --> 33:04.155
<i>like she usually would do,</i>
<i>and she never came back.</i>

33:04.190 --> 33:10.293
<i>She went out jogging along</i>
<i>Anthony Road, and up around</i>
<i>the backside of the dam.</i>

33:10.328 --> 33:14.495
<i> I just dropped</i>
<i>to my knees</i>
<i>when I heard this.</i>

33:14.530 --> 33:17.696
I mean, it was confirmation,
but it was like the worst kind
of confirmation.

33:21.339 --> 33:27.475
<i>There was no question</i>
<i>in my mind that if it was</i>
<i>something that he...</i>

33:27.510 --> 33:29.576
<i>It was a Dogman that did that.</i>

33:29.611 --> 33:33.943
Because, first of all,
what would have happened?

33:33.978 --> 33:37.320
<i>What would have happened</i>
<i>to the body otherwise?</i>

33:37.355 --> 33:41.786
<i>The body was gone.</i>
<i>The clothes were shredded.</i>

33:41.821 --> 33:45.196
<i>There's no bear out there.</i>
<i>There's no cougars out there.</i>

33:45.231 --> 33:47.528
There's no natural predators
that would do that.

33:47.563 --> 33:50.564
<i>And there is, from what I've</i>
<i>heard of other reports,</i>

33:50.599 --> 33:55.239
<i>there are the reports of the</i>
<i>where they will, y'know,</i>

33:55.274 --> 33:59.408
<i>essentially shred off</i>
<i>the clothes off of a human</i>
<i>in an attack.</i>

33:59.443 --> 34:02.411
<i>The LBLO case is one of them.</i>

34:02.446 --> 34:08.010
<i>If... from the Land Between</i>
<i>the Lakes back in '82.</i>

34:08.045 --> 34:12.454
<i>That... They said that</i>
<i>the victims were pretty</i>
<i>much disrobed</i>

34:12.489 --> 34:14.390
<i>of their clothes,</i>
<i>they were just shredded off.</i>

34:17.560 --> 34:18.955
And I've heard of other reports.

34:18.990 --> 34:22.959
Where there were attacks
or at least alleged attacks.

34:29.099 --> 34:30.604
- <i> Ah,</i>
<i>there is a great deal of fear</i>

34:30.639 --> 34:33.244
<i>inherent within these</i>
<i>particular encounters.</i>

34:33.279 --> 34:38.447
It is as if a very
intelligent animal

34:38.482 --> 34:41.747
<i>is evaluating you.</i>

34:41.782 --> 34:44.948
<i>I've heard reports</i>
<i>of people seeing them,</i>

34:44.983 --> 34:48.787
<i>just watching them</i>
<i>from the trees and making</i>
<i>no other kind of movement.</i>

34:48.822 --> 34:54.397
<i>Um, I also have taken reports</i>
<i>from people that have claimed</i>
<i>that they've heard them</i>

34:54.432 --> 34:57.730
<i>coming up onto the porch</i>
<i>and trying the doorknob.</i>

34:57.765 --> 35:02.636
<i>Or, y'know, even more uncanny,</i>
<i>trying to call them outside.</i>

35:02.671 --> 35:05.309
These are the things that
that raise the hackles

35:05.344 --> 35:07.773
on the neck and goose bumps
and everything else.

35:07.808 --> 35:11.249
But, we are definitely dealing
with not just an animal,

35:11.284 --> 35:12.778
we're dealing
with something here

35:12.813 --> 35:15.011
<i>that has a particular</i>
<i>intelligence to it.</i>

35:15.046 --> 35:18.652
- <i> Ah, but from all the</i>
<i>encounters that I've...</i>
<i>that I've taken notes on</i>

35:18.687 --> 35:22.425
<i>and the eyewitnesses</i>
<i>I have investigated,</i>
<i>and spoken with,</i>

35:22.460 --> 35:23.954
<i>um, it's never</i>
<i>a pleasant encounter.</i>

35:23.989 --> 35:27.155
You don't come out of this
feeling enlivened in any way.

35:27.190 --> 35:28.464
Encounters with dogmen,

35:28.499 --> 35:30.598
encounters with these
werewolf type beings,

35:30.633 --> 35:34.162
is something that, um,
is the stuff of nightmares.

35:34.197 --> 35:35.702
<i>Again, people</i>
<i>have asked me,</i>

35:35.737 --> 35:39.101
<i>"What happens whenever</i>
<i>you encounter these things?"</i>

35:39.136 --> 35:41.004
<i>Well, we really</i>
<i>don't know, do we?</i>

35:41.039 --> 35:44.513
<i>I mean, a lot of people</i>
<i>go missing and are never</i>
<i>heard from again.</i>

35:44.548 --> 35:47.549
<i>So, it might have been</i>
<i>an encounter with one</i>
<i>of these creatures.</i>

36:09.375 --> 36:10.671
<i>Land Between the Lakes</i>

36:10.706 --> 36:13.377
<i>is the largest inland peninsula</i>
<i>in America.</i>

36:13.412 --> 36:15.511
<i>And it wasn't always like that.</i>

36:15.546 --> 36:18.976
<i>It used to be a much smaller</i>
<i>trickle of water coming through</i>
<i>a couple of rivers.</i>

36:19.011 --> 36:21.286
It used to be called,
Between the Rivers.

36:21.321 --> 36:24.553
And for whatever reason,
they flooded the areas

36:24.588 --> 36:27.391
and made Lake Barkley
and Lake Kentucky.

36:27.426 --> 36:30.724
And that caused the creation
of Land Between the Lakes.

36:30.759 --> 36:32.990
<i>You got that large</i>
<i>inland peninsula, in America.</i>

36:33.025 --> 36:36.158
<i>There are over 200 cemeteries</i>
<i>in Land Between the Lakes,</i>
<i>y'know.</i>

36:36.193 --> 36:40.030
<i>It's got, really a dark history</i>
<i>because you know a lot</i>
<i>of people's homes,</i>

36:40.065 --> 36:43.066
<i>when they were getting</i>
<i>the area ready, they ran</i>
<i>them out of their homes.</i>

36:43.101 --> 36:45.376
<i>The government threatened them</i>
<i>in one way or another.</i>

36:48.513 --> 36:52.845
<i>There is a lot of dark history</i>
<i>with this land, and I believe</i>

36:52.880 --> 36:55.518
<i>there's even a lot</i>
<i>of cemeteries</i>
<i>that are under water now.</i>

36:55.553 --> 36:58.422
<i>You can still go across</i>
<i>the land and find people's</i>
<i>old homesteads,</i>

36:58.457 --> 37:01.755
<i>where you can see the evidence</i>
<i>where they...</i>

37:01.790 --> 37:05.297
<i>they took over the area</i>
<i>by I reckon, eminent domain.</i>

37:07.466 --> 37:10.434
<i>Since the 1700s,</i>
<i>before they flooded everything,</i>

37:10.469 --> 37:12.227
<i>French explorers</i>
<i>were coming through</i>
<i>the regions,</i>

37:12.262 --> 37:15.098
and they would report that
there were Rougarous
in the region.

37:16.002 --> 37:18.002
<i>Basically a French werewolf.</i>

37:18.037 --> 37:20.576
<i>Y'know, they were very</i>
<i>superstitious about that kind</i>
<i>of thing back then.</i>

37:20.611 --> 37:24.140
<i>So, they probably thought</i>
<i>there are werewolves</i>
<i>in this area.</i>

37:26.650 --> 37:29.552
Of all the Native American
history here,

37:29.587 --> 37:31.785
I don't know of all the
tribes that were here.

37:31.820 --> 37:33.886
But there is a legend
of the Shawnee tribes,

37:33.921 --> 37:37.527
that there was a Shawnee
medicine man, in the region,

37:37.562 --> 37:44.468
who was a skin walker and they
blamed him for some
of the werewolf incidents.

37:44.503 --> 37:46.569
- <i> Some, something</i>
<i>of that nature.</i>

37:46.604 --> 37:49.902
What is so interesting
about this particular area,

37:49.937 --> 37:54.379
<i>is, this was the area of</i>
<i>for the Woodland Indians.</i>

37:54.414 --> 38:00.913
<i>There was a wolf cult part</i>
<i>of that culture at one time,</i>
<i>maybe as early as 1300.</i>

38:00.948 --> 38:04.279
<i>There's instances of</i>
<i>mounds being uncovered,</i>

38:04.314 --> 38:09.361
<i>where the entombed person</i>
<i>was made to appear as if</i>

38:09.396 --> 38:12.397
<i>it were an amalgamation</i>
<i>of man and wolf.</i>

38:12.432 --> 38:16.324
<i>One particular tomb</i>
<i>had the body wrapped in furs</i>

38:16.359 --> 38:20.504
<i>and the jaw was actually</i>
<i>dislocated and some</i>
<i>of the teeth were removed,</i>

38:20.539 --> 38:24.002
<i>in order to place</i>
<i>a wolf snout over it.</i>

38:24.037 --> 38:27.412
<i>What was going on in this area</i>
<i>is really kind of strange,</i>

38:27.447 --> 38:29.073
whenever you talk about this,

38:29.108 --> 38:32.978
this assuming of man and wolf
at the same time.

38:33.013 --> 38:37.488
- <i> Because these mounds</i>
<i>in which this culture</i>
<i>was a part of,</i>

38:37.523 --> 38:39.622
<i>is very near to Defiance, Ohio,</i>

38:39.657 --> 38:42.152
<i>very near</i>
<i>to Elkhorn, Wisconsin,</i>

38:42.187 --> 38:47.465
<i>and also very close to the area</i>
<i>of Land Between the Lakes</i>
<i>as well.</i>

38:47.500 --> 38:48.730
- <i> It's</i>
<i>always seemed like</i>

38:48.765 --> 38:50.963
<i>Dogman is a bit</i>
<i>aggressive in nature,</i>

38:50.998 --> 38:54.967
because you hear so many stories
of people that see it and it
chases them out of an area.

38:55.002 --> 38:59.510
Uh, but, there are multiple
sightings, up from here
in the region where people

38:59.545 --> 39:04.647
just see it run across the trail
or it doesn't chase them,
y'know, they'll just see it.

39:04.682 --> 39:06.308
<i>It seems to be there's</i>

39:06.343 --> 39:08.750
<i>a physical creature of some</i>
<i>kind, uh, y'know.</i>

39:08.785 --> 39:10.686
We find footprints
in the region.

39:10.721 --> 39:14.591
A gentleman's seen a mother
Dogman and pups run across
the roads.

39:14.626 --> 39:18.056
So, there seems to be some kind
of biological animal,
in the region.

39:18.091 --> 39:19.563
- <i> Everything</i>
<i>that we can find, y'know.</i>

39:19.598 --> 39:21.389
<i>You have families</i>
<i>that are physically attacked.</i>

39:21.424 --> 39:27.505
<i>And, people that come up</i>
<i>missing, people supposedly</i>
<i>eating upon.</i>

39:27.540 --> 39:30.200
<i>It's alive, it's aggressive.</i>
<i>It needs to eat.</i>

39:38.749 --> 39:41.211
We had just moved.
I was married at the time.

39:41.246 --> 39:43.752
And my now ex-wife,

39:43.787 --> 39:47.657
we had moved into
this little trailer,
out in the country.

39:47.692 --> 39:49.527
We were freshly married,

39:49.562 --> 39:51.254
engaged, getting ready
to get married at the time.

39:51.289 --> 39:53.531
We got married,
right as we moved in.

39:53.566 --> 39:55.225
<i>And so it was our first.</i>

39:55.260 --> 39:56.699
<i>Our first place together.</i>

39:56.734 --> 39:59.097
<i>Moved in, it was peaceful</i>
<i>and affordable</i>

39:59.132 --> 40:02.001
<i>and we were young</i>
<i>and poor and didn't</i>
<i>have a lot of money then.</i>

40:02.036 --> 40:05.037
<i>So it, it was in our budget.</i>

40:05.072 --> 40:06.940
<i>And we had never...</i>

40:06.975 --> 40:10.438
<i>never had any inkling</i>
<i>going in there?</i>

40:10.473 --> 40:13.342
<i>There was none of that feeling</i>
<i>when we were</i>
<i>looking at the place.</i>

40:17.722 --> 40:20.316
<i>So I mean there,</i>
<i>there was a lot of history</i>
<i>through that area,</i>

40:20.351 --> 40:24.760
<i>but there was, no, there was...</i>
<i>There was slavery there,</i>
<i>there was Union occupation.</i>

40:24.795 --> 40:28.423
<i>Ah, you know, there was,</i>
<i>there was deaths in the area,</i>
<i>and it was very old.</i>

40:28.458 --> 40:31.932
<i>And it, it was Native American</i>
<i>land at one point in time, too.</i>

40:31.967 --> 40:35.936
<i>And we were,</i>
<i>we were settled in and...</i>

40:35.971 --> 40:39.940
<i>I'm guessing within,</i>
<i>like a month, things started</i>
<i>to get different.</i>

40:39.975 --> 40:44.472
<i>You had... During the day,</i>
<i>it was very peaceful</i>
<i>and serene,</i>

40:44.507 --> 40:47.277
<i>very rural, country setting.</i>

40:47.312 --> 40:51.050
<i>At night, from the time</i>
<i>the sun went down,</i>
<i>from dusk until about 4 a.m.,</i>

40:51.085 --> 40:52.887
<i>there was just</i>
<i>this different vibe.</i>

40:52.922 --> 40:56.957
<i>And we would, ah...</i>

40:56.992 --> 40:58.629
<i>feel this different.</i>

40:58.664 --> 41:00.928
<i>You would just walk outside</i>
<i>and it would just initiate</i>

41:00.963 --> 41:03.997
<i>this extreme, instant</i>
<i>fight or flight response.</i>

41:04.032 --> 41:06.934
<i>Ah... mostly flight.</i>
<i>There was no fight</i>

41:06.969 --> 41:09.497
<i>and you just didn't</i>
<i>want to be out there.</i>

41:09.532 --> 41:16.240
Then, we would go into this...
start hearing noises
and scratches outside the house.

41:16.275 --> 41:19.045
You would see from the old
cemetery in homestead,

41:19.080 --> 41:22.983
which was next
to where we lived.

41:23.018 --> 41:27.790
Ah, we started seeing red
glowing eyes, and they would be
seven to eight feet in the air.

41:27.825 --> 41:32.564
<i>And... the shadow that you've</i>
<i>seen was bipedal,</i>

41:32.599 --> 41:36.095
<i>and it almost looked like a...</i>
<i>like a giant canine.</i>

41:36.130 --> 41:39.934
<i>It didn't have any, you know,</i>
<i>human features to it.</i>

41:39.969 --> 41:43.971
<i>And seven to eight feet tall,</i>
<i>very broad shouldered.</i>

41:44.006 --> 41:49.713
<i>And it had this, had this...</i>
<i>canine-looking head to it.</i>

41:49.748 --> 41:53.508
<i>It didn't... you know,</i>
<i>it just did look</i>
<i>like a giant dog.</i>

41:53.543 --> 41:59.888
<i>And... the very first time</i>
<i>that I... that I heard,</i>
<i>heard anything, um...</i>

41:59.923 --> 42:03.661
<i>We had gone,</i>
<i>gone grocery shopping</i>
<i>on Friday night,</i>

42:03.696 --> 42:07.489
<i>gone out to eat, come home,</i>
<i>put everything away,</i>
<i>went to bed.</i>

42:07.524 --> 42:10.734
<i>And when we were lying in bed,</i>
<i>and this,</i>

42:10.769 --> 42:14.463
<i>this raking of claws</i>
<i>was going on, right outside</i>

42:14.498 --> 42:18.071
<i>outside of the house</i>
<i>in the bedroom.</i>

42:18.106 --> 42:23.978
<i>I just, I refused to go out.</i>
<i>We just rode it out,</i>
<i>let it go, and...</i>

42:24.013 --> 42:29.181
<i>We went out the next morning,</i>
<i>and the... from the area,</i>
<i>you could hear the noise</i>

42:29.216 --> 42:33.515
<i>from what's probably,</i>
<i>you know, seven to eight</i>
<i>feet up off the ground.</i>

42:33.550 --> 42:35.957
<i>And, and there were no</i>
<i>claw marks or anything,</i>

42:35.992 --> 42:39.323
<i>but we heard</i>
<i>definitely raking of claws,</i>
<i>the whole night long.</i>

42:39.358 --> 42:43.932
<i>And then shortly</i>
<i>after that, ah, we were,</i>
<i>we were in the kitchen</i>

42:43.967 --> 42:46.495
<i>and, and noticed</i>
<i>the glowing eyes</i>
<i>in the woods.</i>

42:46.530 --> 42:49.366
<i>And then we stepped out</i>
<i>on the front to look and...</i>

42:49.401 --> 42:53.436
<i>And you could just see it</i>
<i>sitting there watching</i>
<i>and just observing us.</i>

42:53.471 --> 42:56.076
<i>And it would just do that</i>
<i>every once in a while.</i>

42:56.749 --> 42:59.508
<i>The, the most...</i>

42:59.543 --> 43:03.215
<i>The most common thing</i>
<i>that it did all the time</i>
<i>was this.</i>

43:03.250 --> 43:08.055
<i>This energy that it put off,</i>
<i>it just inundated your senses</i>
<i>with instant fight or flight.</i>

43:08.090 --> 43:12.125
<i>And, and you could tell,</i>
<i>the sun went down</i>
<i>to about 4 a.m.</i>

43:12.160 --> 43:15.293
<i>You just dealt with that.</i>
<i>And if you went</i>
<i>outside the house,</i>

43:15.328 --> 43:17.559
<i>it, it just overwhelmed you.</i>

43:17.594 --> 43:21.629
<i>It was very, it was the most</i>
<i>intense thing I've ever</i>
<i>experienced in my life.</i>

43:21.664 --> 43:26.073
<i>It would be, it didn't do this</i>
<i>every night. It would</i>
<i>be gone for a few days,</i>

43:26.108 --> 43:27.635
<i>and then it would come back.</i>

43:27.670 --> 43:30.814
<i>And I don't know if we were</i>
<i>just on part of its route,</i>

43:30.849 --> 43:33.443
<i>and that whole area</i>
<i>was its territory.</i>

43:33.478 --> 43:39.823
<i>Ah, but every time...</i>
<i>we saw the eyes, it was always</i>
<i>in the old homestead</i>

43:39.858 --> 43:43.024
<i>at the old family cemetery.</i>
<i>It is where it always was.</i>

43:46.689 --> 43:51.230
<i>My now ex-wife, then she would</i>
<i>see things. And I traveled</i>
<i>for work, which I mostly do.</i>

43:51.265 --> 43:55.872
<i>And she had things happen</i>
<i>while I was at...</i>
<i>I was at work.</i>

43:55.907 --> 43:58.666
<i>And it was to the point</i>
<i>where she was like,</i>
<i>"We have to move.</i>

43:58.701 --> 44:00.338
<i>I can't do this anymore."</i>

44:00.373 --> 44:02.109
<i>So that's when</i>
<i>we decided to go.</i>

44:04.212 --> 44:06.751
<i>It was extremely peaceful.</i>

44:06.786 --> 44:08.984
<i>Other than that,</i>
<i>we didn't have anything.</i>

44:09.019 --> 44:12.988
<i>And that was the only issues</i>
<i>we had the whole time</i>
<i>we were there.</i>

44:13.023 --> 44:15.694
<i>But I mean, we lived there</i>
<i>six months and</i>
<i>it made us leave.</i>

44:16.686 --> 44:18.587
It was very odd.

44:18.622 --> 44:22.228
It was almost like it had
this ability to where it was...

44:23.968 --> 44:26.133
kind of real and then
kind of spiritual.

44:26.168 --> 44:29.774
Like it, it had some,
some physical attributes to it.

44:29.809 --> 44:34.812
But, the rest of it seemed
very, very supernatural
and, and paranormal.

44:54.097 --> 44:56.691
<i>I was 18 when I had</i>
<i>my first encounter.</i>

44:56.726 --> 44:58.000
<i>I was in the Bell City swamp.</i>

44:58.035 --> 45:00.134
<i>I couldn't...</i>
<i>I used to hunt a lot.</i>

45:00.169 --> 45:03.566
<i>Every given night available,</i>
<i>I was out in the woods.</i>

45:03.601 --> 45:07.570
<i>And I had heard</i>
<i>about something</i>
<i>in the woods.</i>

45:07.605 --> 45:10.177
<i>Eighteen. Stupid.</i>
<i>I wasn't scared much.</i>

45:10.212 --> 45:12.608
<i>Took my dogs out.</i>

45:12.643 --> 45:15.985
<i>We're having a good night.</i>
<i>We killed five coons</i>
<i>I think that night.</i>

45:17.681 --> 45:20.385
<i>We trailed a bobcat.</i>
<i>Just got off it.</i>

45:20.420 --> 45:22.519
<i>We went deeper,</i>
<i>about one in the morning.</i>

45:24.721 --> 45:26.897
<i>I should have known.</i>
<i>We didn't hear deer.</i>

45:26.932 --> 45:30.263
<i>We didn't see deer,</i>
<i>we didn't hear crickets.</i>

45:30.298 --> 45:33.332
<i>That's all signs</i>
<i>of big predators in the area.</i>
<i>I should have known.</i>

45:35.567 --> 45:37.908
<i>I had two dogs</i>
<i>come back out of three.</i>

45:37.943 --> 45:42.880
<i>And when I say two come back,</i>
<i>they howled past me</i>
<i>and didn't slow down.</i>

45:42.915 --> 45:45.674
<i>And these are trained coon</i>
<i>dogs, trained to stop.</i>

45:45.709 --> 45:50.514
<i>I was worried because</i>
<i>the one that was missing</i>
<i>was worth about $1500,</i>

45:50.549 --> 45:52.285
<i>and she was my prize dog.</i>

45:53.255 --> 45:54.485
<i>So I went in looking.</i>

45:57.127 --> 45:58.588
<i>A smell hit me.</i>

46:01.296 --> 46:05.496
<i>I've been around dead animals.</i>
<i>I've been around carcasses.</i>
<i>I know what they smell like.</i>

46:07.269 --> 46:10.105
<i>It smelled like rotting meat</i>
<i>and a wet dog.</i>

46:11.944 --> 46:14.472
<i>The growl that coming out</i>
<i>of this animal...</i>

46:17.444 --> 46:19.081
<i>hit me in my bones.</i>

46:19.116 --> 46:22.183
<i>Just you won't forget it</i>
<i>if you could trust me.</i>

46:23.252 --> 46:25.956
<i>I had light touched my hat.</i>

46:25.991 --> 46:30.389
<i>When I flung it around,</i>
<i>I hit something in the eyes</i>

46:30.424 --> 46:33.458
<i>that was standing seven</i>
<i>and a half feet off the ground</i>
<i>at the eyes.</i>

46:34.494 --> 46:38.166
<i>Black fur... Head like a wolf.</i>

46:38.201 --> 46:39.530
<i>Plenty of hairs on top.</i>

46:40.797 --> 46:42.170
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>what I was looking at.</i>

46:43.668 --> 46:45.701
<i>Here I am</i>
<i>on the double-barrel 20 gauge.</i>

46:46.605 --> 46:47.846
<i>I'm outgunned,</i>
<i>I know it.</i>

46:48.871 --> 46:50.343
<i>I eased away...</i>

46:51.984 --> 46:53.808
<i>backwards, trying to</i>
<i>get away from it...</i>

46:54.877 --> 46:58.747
<i>and... it stepped off.</i>

46:58.782 --> 47:01.783
<i>like it didn't want</i>
<i>to be in the light.</i>

47:01.818 --> 47:03.323
<i>I tried to keep my eye on it.</i>

47:05.162 --> 47:07.690
<i>And it was gone.</i>

47:07.725 --> 47:11.298
<i>I've never seen anything</i>
<i>move that quick. I mean,</i>
<i>it was there. It's gone.</i>

47:11.333 --> 47:13.201
I took off for the truck.

47:13.236 --> 47:15.907
And when I got back,
the truck was facing the woods.

47:17.273 --> 47:18.569
My dogs went back.

47:19.473 --> 47:22.474
They beat me to the truck.

47:22.509 --> 47:27.545
When I turned the headlights on
to turn the truck around,
it was standing in the edge.

47:27.580 --> 47:29.921
Like it had followed me up
until I left.

47:29.956 --> 47:33.155
<i>I've been around enough animals</i>
<i>to know if it's got claws</i>

47:33.190 --> 47:36.224
<i>and it's got teeth</i>
<i>shaped like that.</i>
<i>It, it don't eat plants.</i>

47:37.788 --> 47:40.393
<i>It's got big canine teeth,</i>
<i>and it's got big, sharp claws.</i>

47:40.428 --> 47:43.165
<i>It did not go around</i>
<i>munching on blackberries.</i>

47:43.200 --> 47:47.202
<i>My blue tip coon hound</i>
<i>found a bloody car.</i>

47:47.237 --> 47:51.437
<i>And it was cut in three places,</i>
<i>and it was</i>
<i>a solid leather strap.</i>

47:54.574 --> 47:55.705
Two years ago...

47:57.082 --> 47:58.906
the last encounter I had,

47:58.941 --> 48:02.448
and the one that literally
made me sell my dogs
and quit coon hunting.

48:04.551 --> 48:05.990
Dad called me.

48:06.025 --> 48:07.354
Wants me to train a couple pups.

48:08.819 --> 48:11.061
The problem, I've done
it all my life.

48:11.096 --> 48:12.854
Okay. Run them over.

48:12.889 --> 48:14.559
You run it out.
Run them tonight.

48:15.265 --> 48:17.430
We started out.

48:17.465 --> 48:21.104
I had old black and tan
and an old red bone.

48:22.536 --> 48:24.305
<i>And Dad had his</i>
<i>two little pups.</i>

48:25.638 --> 48:27.737
<i>Dad didn't wanna go that night.</i>

48:27.772 --> 48:29.981
<i>That's fine. I'll take him.</i>

48:30.016 --> 48:33.017
<i>It started out great,</i>
<i>I mean Bella hit.</i>

48:33.052 --> 48:36.548
<i>My black and tan,</i>
<i>she had a trail on me.</i>

48:36.583 --> 48:41.190
<i>We're off, we're both</i>
<i>trying to look for the ball.</i>

48:41.225 --> 48:46.954
That little bit of red bone
that he had on a
section of horse jaw,

48:46.989 --> 48:51.134
I'm guessing around 6-8 inches.

48:51.169 --> 48:52.168
<i>Had teeth in it.</i>

48:53.798 --> 48:57.371
<i>I felt that was kind of funny.</i>
<i>No feelings.</i>

48:57.406 --> 49:01.507
<i>I thought it was...</i>
<i>so I followed him.</i>
<i>I come look...</i>

49:02.147 --> 49:03.146
<i>on...</i>

49:05.150 --> 49:07.876
<i>I think it was</i>
<i>a whole skeleton.</i>

49:07.911 --> 49:12.650
<i>The bones were some</i>
<i>chewed up and mutilated.</i>

49:12.685 --> 49:17.127
<i>I could make out a skull,</i>
<i>the pelvis, some ribs,</i>
<i>and the fingers.</i>

49:18.328 --> 49:21.824
And the skull
was in about 33, 34 pieces.

49:22.860 --> 49:24.200
That put me on alert.

49:25.368 --> 49:28.798
But, predators
tear up bones.

49:28.833 --> 49:32.637
No big deal. Coyote's chew them,
squirrels chew them, calcium.

49:32.672 --> 49:35.178
<i>Pups wouldn't listen.</i>
<i>I wanted to go back.</i>

49:35.213 --> 49:37.906
<i>I was not tired for the night,</i>
<i>anyways. They didn't quit.</i>

49:39.184 --> 49:40.744
<i>My big dog</i>
<i>was still on a trail.</i>

49:40.779 --> 49:45.089
<i>She wouldn't cut off,</i>
<i>so I had to go in at him.</i>

49:45.124 --> 49:50.358
<i>Even farther and farther</i>
<i>I went, the more bones I found.</i>

49:50.393 --> 49:53.955
<i>And, I come upon the pups</i>
<i>and they were just laying</i>
<i>on the ground.</i>

49:53.990 --> 49:54.989
Flat. Just...

49:57.103 --> 50:03.371
<i>Wouldn't move...</i>
<i>The dog was between me</i>
<i>and something in front of me.</i>

50:04.374 --> 50:06.968
Growling. Bristled up.

50:07.003 --> 50:10.378
<i>Snarling, acting like</i>
<i>I've never seen her act.</i>

50:10.413 --> 50:12.677
The growl that I heard
that night...

50:13.581 --> 50:14.877
It was like you could feel it.

50:16.980 --> 50:18.914
It was, it came from its gut.

50:27.463 --> 50:29.166
<i>I was 15 yards from it.</i>

50:30.367 --> 50:32.026
<i>It was massive.</i>

50:35.405 --> 50:37.405
<i>I was close enough</i>
<i>when he could,</i>

50:37.440 --> 50:40.078
<i>when he'd sniff, you could</i>
<i>see his nose wrinkle up.</i>

50:41.741 --> 50:43.708
<i>That's way too close.</i>

50:44.909 --> 50:46.546
<i>Way too close.</i>

50:46.581 --> 50:49.076
<i>I've always been told,</i>
<i>like most kids</i>
<i>in Southern areas,</i>

50:49.111 --> 50:52.849
<i>"Be careful, there's Panthers</i>
<i>in the woods and..."</i>

50:52.884 --> 50:55.489
<i>I mean, this is Western</i>
<i>Kentucky. We don't have bear,</i>

50:55.524 --> 50:58.888
<i>but every now and then,</i>
<i>because they wander up</i>
<i>out of Tennessee, but...</i>

50:58.923 --> 51:02.661
<i>I've faced predators,</i>

51:02.696 --> 51:07.600
<i>most of your big game predators</i>
<i>that you have in the States.</i>

51:07.635 --> 51:11.439
<i>These things don't act</i>
<i>like that. You look</i>
<i>in these thing's eyes.</i>

51:11.474 --> 51:13.903
<i>These things look like they're</i>
<i>trying to figure you out.</i>

51:13.938 --> 51:16.939
<i>They look like they're looking</i>
<i>through you, trying to figure</i>
<i>out what your next move is</i>

51:18.283 --> 51:19.447
<i>so they can get around it.</i>

51:22.045 --> 51:24.221
<i>I've been around predators</i>
<i>my whole life,</i>

51:24.256 --> 51:28.258
<i>and I've never seen anything</i>
<i>in my life like that.</i>

51:28.293 --> 51:31.327
<i>I've never seen anything</i>
<i>look like it had</i>
<i>enough consciousness</i>

51:31.362 --> 51:32.988
<i>to know what you might do.</i>

51:35.663 --> 51:37.828
<i>I think that scares me</i>
<i>as much as seeing them.</i>

51:40.162 --> 51:41.436
<i>This one wasn't scared.</i>

51:42.868 --> 51:44.208
<i>This one wasn't curious.</i>

51:46.674 --> 51:49.037
<i>This one did not want me there.</i>

51:49.072 --> 51:54.284
<i>You would come up closer.</i>

51:54.319 --> 51:58.618
<i>When I cooned, I carried</i>
<i>a double-barrel</i> 410
<i>and a double-barrel 20 gauge.</i>

51:58.653 --> 52:01.522
<i>Double-barreled 410.</i>
<i>Double-hammered old gun.</i>

52:02.228 --> 52:04.591
<i>And a .357 pistol.</i>

52:04.626 --> 52:07.759
<i>The fact that my coon dog</i>
<i>never moved</i>

52:07.794 --> 52:09.530
<i>didn't even faze this animal.</i>

52:11.666 --> 52:13.798
<i>She might as well been</i>
<i>to a piss and come along now.</i>

52:14.768 --> 52:15.998
<i>It walked...</i>

52:17.837 --> 52:21.069
<i>In a semi-circle around me</i>
<i>like a predatory move would.</i>

52:23.447 --> 52:26.877
<i>At this point,</i>
<i>I pretty much know.</i>

52:26.912 --> 52:29.110
<i>It came over, done.</i>

52:32.522 --> 52:36.623
<i>He got three quarter</i>
<i>of the way around me...</i>

52:36.658 --> 52:41.694
<i>in the loudest, deepest howl</i>
<i>I've ever heard that come from</i>
<i>deeper in the swamp.</i>

52:44.226 --> 52:45.797
<i>His ears perked up.</i>

52:48.032 --> 52:51.407
<i>And it was like I wasn't</i>
<i>even there at that point.</i>

52:51.442 --> 52:52.705
<i>He held back.</i>

52:55.072 --> 52:58.909
<i>He acknowledged me</i>
<i>by roaring at me so loud,</i>
<i>I ain't even gonna lie.</i>

53:00.913 --> 53:04.288
<i>I pissed my pants that night.</i>
<i>It scared me so bad.</i>

53:05.588 --> 53:07.324
<i>So I just threw the shotgun up.</i>

53:07.359 --> 53:11.361
<i>Well, at least</i>
<i>I might get blood.</i>

53:11.396 --> 53:16.663
<i>When I threw the barrels up,</i>
<i>he cleared the bushes</i>
<i>behind him that were probably</i>

53:16.698 --> 53:19.699
six, seven foot... and was gone.

53:20.570 --> 53:21.635
Foot towards the hell.

53:23.573 --> 53:26.871
I come home that night.
I sold 17 dogs the next morning.

53:29.447 --> 53:32.382
I sold all my gear
except my coon hunting light.

53:34.177 --> 53:37.321
And the only time I go out now
in the dark, if I'm hunting

53:37.356 --> 53:39.521
is if I'm around ponds
and hunting frogs.

53:40.557 --> 53:42.557
I do not go near
that swamp at night.

53:42.592 --> 53:44.559
I'll go during the day.

53:44.594 --> 53:46.528
I will not go at night.

53:46.563 --> 53:49.828
The reason I wanted to stay
anonymous is I've had people
tell me I'm crazy.

53:49.863 --> 53:51.093
I've had people tell me...

53:52.261 --> 53:55.031
I'm drinking too much,
doing drugs.

53:56.298 --> 53:57.440
Lyin'.

53:58.069 --> 53:58.903
No.

53:59.609 --> 54:01.345
They're real.

54:01.380 --> 54:03.006
Science might
not have found them. But...

54:04.779 --> 54:05.811
don't mean nothing.

54:07.045 --> 54:08.484
They stay hidden for a reason.

54:18.254 --> 54:20.056
<i>My name is Martin Groves.</i>

54:21.631 --> 54:27.195
<i>I had an incident in the 1990s</i>
<i>spring turkey season,</i>

54:27.230 --> 54:29.736
<i>that kind of connected me</i>
<i>to the area.</i>

54:29.771 --> 54:32.772
<i>I'm a retired police officer</i>
<i>of 32 years.</i>

54:32.807 --> 54:35.808
<i>I've been with a local,</i>
<i>rural sheriff's department</i>

54:35.843 --> 54:38.811
of which I have now
since retired.

54:38.846 --> 54:42.111
Uh, but I was
with the department
for many years,

54:42.146 --> 54:48.656
and a uniformed patrol officer.
Coming from a... a...
a police background,

54:48.691 --> 54:52.121
ah, it's going to ruffle
a lot of... a lot of feathers.

54:52.156 --> 54:56.664
<i>The only reason why I've even</i>
<i>come forward at this point</i>
<i>is one, I have retired,</i>

54:56.699 --> 55:01.438
<i>and I don't really care</i>
<i>what people think of me</i>
<i>or what will be said.</i>

55:01.473 --> 55:03.968
<i>I feel like there is something</i>
<i>within that park...</i>

55:06.302 --> 55:08.335
<i>animal or beast,</i>

55:08.370 --> 55:11.305
<i>that is a danger to the public.</i>

55:11.340 --> 55:16.849
<i>I was told that this would be</i>
<i>very detrimental to any tourism</i>

55:16.884 --> 55:21.150
and to anything that
any public reports coming out

55:21.185 --> 55:23.922
that there was any kind
of animals eating people.

55:23.957 --> 55:26.155
Or attacking people
within the park.

55:26.190 --> 55:29.224
And there has been a long time,

55:29.259 --> 55:32.964
<i>standing, unwritten rule</i>

55:32.999 --> 55:40.004
<i>that they control the reports</i>
<i>that come outside the parks</i>
<i>because of this.</i>

55:40.039 --> 55:43.876
In the '70s,
there was a group of kids

55:43.911 --> 55:46.615
that disappeared up there,
then Land Between the Lakes.

55:46.650 --> 55:48.650
<i>They heard a bunch</i>
<i>of screaming and...</i>

55:48.685 --> 55:50.850
<i>when the other group</i>
<i>came up to them,</i>

55:50.885 --> 55:53.050
<i>they disappeared,</i>
<i>never to be seen again.</i>

55:53.085 --> 55:58.528
<i>1979. That was over</i>
<i>around Willow Bay,</i>
<i>the members bay area.</i>

55:58.563 --> 56:01.729
<i>There was a gentleman.</i>
<i>He worked in</i>
<i>Kentucky Fish and Game.</i>

56:01.764 --> 56:06.393
<i>He said that he witnessed</i>
<i>a Dogman jump on a couple</i>
<i>that was camping there</i>

56:06.428 --> 56:08.065
<i>along the shoreline,</i>

56:08.100 --> 56:10.474
<i>held them down with its hands</i>
<i>and biting plugs out of them,</i>

56:10.509 --> 56:14.907
<i>and they were able</i>
<i>to confirm his employment</i>
<i>through the state and what not.</i>

56:14.942 --> 56:20.682
<i>Ah, you got the famed 1982</i>
<i>attack of the family that was</i>
<i>slaughtered very terrible.</i>

56:20.717 --> 56:25.885
There's multiple variations
of the story, but largely
they have retained the same way.

56:25.920 --> 56:29.284
So that story boiled down
to its most basic form,

56:29.319 --> 56:31.957
is a family of four,
came down to the Land
Between the Lakes.

56:31.992 --> 56:34.894
They were either
in a travel trailer or an RV.

56:34.929 --> 56:37.930
<i>And they came down</i>
<i>to do some camping</i>
<i>up at the northern end</i>

56:37.965 --> 56:40.295
<i>of Land Between the Lakes,</i>
<i>while they were, I guess,</i>

56:40.330 --> 56:42.297
<i>getting set up</i>
<i>and everything ready.</i>

56:42.332 --> 56:46.400
<i>A Dogman came up</i>
<i>and literally</i>
<i>slaughtered the family.</i>

56:50.307 --> 56:53.275
<i>Just dispatched them</i>
<i>in a grisly manner.</i>

56:53.310 --> 56:56.916
<i>People came back</i>
<i>through, cops, ah...</i>

56:56.951 --> 57:01.657
<i>The government in some form,</i>
<i>hikers and they found</i>
<i>the family dead.</i>

57:01.692 --> 57:04.220
<i>They found three bodies,</i>
<i>but they couldn't</i>
<i>find the little girl.</i>

57:04.255 --> 57:06.354
<i>Anyway, there was a little girl</i>
<i>along with them.</i>

57:06.389 --> 57:09.456
<i>And they eventually found her</i>
<i>either up in the top of a tree</i>

57:09.491 --> 57:12.635
or somewhere about
100 feet away from the RV.

57:12.670 --> 57:15.132
There is a little bit
of contention on that.

57:15.167 --> 57:19.004
It has become a famous story
of the region, now almost
teetering on urban legend.

57:19.039 --> 57:21.809
And you can even find evidence
that it happened because

57:21.844 --> 57:24.372
<i>the spot where</i>
<i>it allegedly took place,</i>

57:24.407 --> 57:28.475
<i>you can find where</i>
<i>the light poles</i>
<i>are cut even to the ground.</i>

57:28.510 --> 57:30.587
<i>You can find the old RV slips.</i>

57:30.622 --> 57:33.656
<i>You can find</i>
<i>the old foundations</i>
<i>for the bathhouses.</i>

57:33.691 --> 57:36.153
<i>Something seemed to</i>
<i>have taken place there.</i>

57:36.188 --> 57:38.793
<i>You can find the old,</i>
<i>the boundary stakes.</i>

57:38.828 --> 57:41.389
<i>It really looks like</i>
<i>something happened.</i>

57:41.424 --> 57:42.456
<i>And then...</i>

57:43.635 --> 57:46.999
some government crew
or the park came in,

57:47.034 --> 57:49.397
tore it all up
and let nature retake itself.

57:51.907 --> 57:57.207
You can tell that, for once
some reason they wanted
to do away with this area.

57:57.242 --> 58:00.309
And that, that's the most
famous story from up there.

58:00.344 --> 58:03.950
The next famous would
probably be, there was
a bow hunter up there

58:03.985 --> 58:07.151
whose body was found dead
and I haven't found them yet.

58:07.186 --> 58:10.924
<i>But supposedly there are</i>
<i>documents showing</i>
<i>he was found in the park.</i>

58:10.959 --> 58:13.696
<i>He was dead.</i>
<i>It was all factual.</i>

58:13.731 --> 58:16.699
<i>When they found his body</i>
<i>in a soybean field over</i>

58:16.734 --> 58:19.636
<i>around where we camp</i>
<i>a lot, Dark Hollow.</i>

58:19.671 --> 58:20.901
<i>His body was fed upon.</i>

58:24.104 --> 58:27.611
I'm going to be very respectful
because of the family

58:27.646 --> 58:29.580
that, uh, suffered a loss.

58:30.242 --> 58:31.472
A hunter was killed...

58:32.442 --> 58:34.475
and was mauled to death.

58:34.510 --> 58:39.183
But the official report says
it was a unknown animal.

58:39.218 --> 58:40.558
<i>Unknown species.</i>

58:41.418 --> 58:43.693
<i>The reports...</i>

58:43.728 --> 58:46.993
<i>that I have read,</i>
<i>and what I have been told</i>

58:47.028 --> 58:51.030
<i>is that the animal</i>
<i>was either a cougar or a bear,</i>

58:51.065 --> 58:53.230
<i>that had ripped</i>
<i>the man out of his tent.</i>

58:53.265 --> 58:56.002
<i>And had consumed him</i>
<i>and pulled his body</i>

58:56.037 --> 58:58.906
<i>three to four hundred</i>
<i>yards away from the tent.</i>

58:58.941 --> 59:04.241
It is my belief that I actually
had met this man the day before

59:04.276 --> 59:07.145
while I was out
and was scouting.

59:07.180 --> 59:09.213
And I do not know
if it was or not.

59:09.248 --> 59:14.053
<i>I do know</i>
<i>that the man that I met was</i>
<i>in the same immediate area,</i>

59:14.088 --> 59:16.660
<i>and I observed</i>
<i>his pickup truck.</i>

59:16.695 --> 59:20.026
<i>And there's just too many</i>
<i>indications to me</i>
<i>that I believe</i>

59:20.061 --> 59:21.698
<i>that the man that I met</i>

59:21.733 --> 59:24.261
<i>is the same man</i>
<i>that was pulled out</i>
<i>of his tent and eaten.</i>

59:28.003 --> 59:31.708
One of the common things
when you're researching
Dogman is, it is strange.

59:31.743 --> 59:33.138
Toward the northern end
of the parks

59:33.173 --> 59:35.536
<i>where they are at,</i>
<i>you'll find Dogman activity.</i>

59:35.571 --> 59:37.879
<i>But to the southern end,</i>
<i>you find Bigfoot activity.</i>

59:37.914 --> 59:40.607
<i>Dogmen in the North,</i>
<i>Bigfoot in the South.</i>

59:40.642 --> 59:45.051
<i>So it does seem</i>
<i>in some ways, there is a,</i>
<i>a territorial aspect to it.</i>

59:45.086 --> 59:49.286
<i>I don't know. It could be</i>
<i>hungry, aggressive predator,</i>
<i>could be territory.</i>

59:49.321 --> 59:51.662
<i>Ah, there's a lot of factors</i>
<i>that could be at play.</i>

59:53.556 --> 59:58.262
In the spring of,
I believe it was 1993-94,

59:58.297 --> 1:00:02.233
a hunting partner and myself...

1:00:02.268 --> 1:00:05.104
A friend that I actually worked
at the sheriff's office with,

1:00:05.139 --> 1:00:07.909
had decided to take a trip

1:00:07.944 --> 1:00:10.439
into Land Between the Lakes
for turkey hunting.

1:00:11.277 --> 1:00:12.749
<i>The first night we came in,</i>

1:00:12.784 --> 1:00:16.643
<i>we had absolutely</i>
<i>no problems whatsoever.</i>

1:00:16.678 --> 1:00:21.285
<i>The next day, we both got up</i>
<i>and decided to take</i>

1:00:21.320 --> 1:00:25.421
<i>a small excursion,</i>
<i>searching for birds,</i>

1:00:25.456 --> 1:00:27.764
<i>and we went our separate ways.</i>

1:00:27.799 --> 1:00:32.901
<i>We had a very nice</i>
<i>game trail to follow,</i>

1:00:32.936 --> 1:00:36.905
<i>and I followed for miles</i>
<i>and throughout the entire day.</i>

1:00:36.940 --> 1:00:39.842
<i>At this point</i>
<i>in the late afternoon,</i>

1:00:41.010 --> 1:00:43.813
<i>I had a...</i>

1:00:43.848 --> 1:00:48.411
feeling that I was being
followed inside the woods.

1:00:48.446 --> 1:00:50.985
Behind me I could hear movement,

1:00:51.020 --> 1:00:53.449
and I could feel a presence

1:00:53.484 --> 1:00:57.651
that I did not know if it was
animal or if it was man.

1:00:57.686 --> 1:01:01.127
<i>Being an avid hunter,</i>
<i>I was very observant.</i>

1:01:01.162 --> 1:01:03.932
<i>Two to 300 yards behind me,</i>

1:01:03.967 --> 1:01:05.296
<i>on the trail behind me,</i>

1:01:05.331 --> 1:01:07.870
<i>I could see</i>
<i>movement in the woods.</i>

1:01:07.905 --> 1:01:11.038
<i>I continued through</i>
<i>the woods for some time,</i>

1:01:11.073 --> 1:01:15.878
<i>and followed the game trail,</i>
<i>edging my way back to my camp.</i>

1:01:15.913 --> 1:01:19.376
<i>When I did actually</i>
<i>catch movement in the woods</i>

1:01:19.411 --> 1:01:20.784
<i>and I could see</i>

1:01:20.819 --> 1:01:23.952
<i>that there was two,</i>
<i>or possibly three animals</i>

1:01:23.987 --> 1:01:26.823
<i>that was tailing me,</i>
<i>but when I would stop,</i>

1:01:26.858 --> 1:01:29.188
<i>the movement would stop</i>
<i>in the woods.</i>

1:01:29.223 --> 1:01:30.717
<i>I continued on,</i>

1:01:30.752 --> 1:01:33.027
<i>and as I've become closer</i>
<i>to my camp,</i>

1:01:34.591 --> 1:01:39.495
<i>I could hear</i>
<i>a distinct knock in the woods,</i>

1:01:39.530 --> 1:01:44.874
<i>and it would be a large boom,</i>

1:01:44.909 --> 1:01:49.571
like someone had taken an axe
or something up against a tree.

1:01:49.606 --> 1:01:53.542
So, at that point, I believed
it was my hunting partner

1:01:53.577 --> 1:01:55.610
and I was getting
closer to camp.

1:01:55.645 --> 1:01:58.052
As I got closer to camp,

1:01:58.087 --> 1:02:02.518
<i>is when I first observed</i>
<i>what I believe to be</i>

1:02:02.553 --> 1:02:06.324
<i>a man in a ghillie suit.</i>

1:02:06.359 --> 1:02:07.864
<i>So I just wrote it off,</i>

1:02:07.899 --> 1:02:10.559
<i>you know,</i>
<i>I'm a, I'm on a hot trail.</i>

1:02:10.594 --> 1:02:12.561
I just need to get back to camp.

1:02:12.596 --> 1:02:15.597
Somebody is watching me
to the west of me,

1:02:15.632 --> 1:02:18.402
and somebody's coming in
on a game trail behind me

1:02:18.437 --> 1:02:20.437
<i>that's an animal.</i>

1:02:20.472 --> 1:02:22.472
<i>Something was just tagging me.</i>

1:02:23.882 --> 1:02:25.882
<i>I finally did make it</i>
<i>back to camp.</i>

1:02:25.917 --> 1:02:30.315
<i>The closer I began getting</i>
<i>to my camp, I heard whistles.</i>

1:02:31.857 --> 1:02:33.747
<i>I could hear a whistle</i>

1:02:33.782 --> 1:02:38.620
<i>that was human-like,</i>
<i>that was a shrill whistle.</i>

1:02:38.655 --> 1:02:40.930
<i>I attributed</i>
<i>a lot of these things</i>

1:02:40.965 --> 1:02:43.966
<i>to, 'this is my hunting partner</i>
<i>back in camp.'</i>

1:02:44.001 --> 1:02:45.902
'He's knocking something.'

1:02:45.937 --> 1:02:48.905
'He's whistling,
trying to get me to come in,

1:02:48.940 --> 1:02:50.797
'so, I came in to camp.'

1:02:50.832 --> 1:02:53.140
And immediately
when I come in to camp,

1:02:53.175 --> 1:02:55.945
my friend that I have known
for many years,

1:02:55.980 --> 1:02:57.738
I could tell was very shook.

1:02:57.773 --> 1:03:01.742
There was something not right
with my hunting partner,

1:03:01.777 --> 1:03:04.316
and I said, look, I'm sorry
I've been gone.

1:03:04.351 --> 1:03:08.320
He said, "It's not that. I was
a little bit worried about you,

1:03:08.355 --> 1:03:12.192
<i>"but there is something</i>
<i>around the camp".</i>

1:03:13.657 --> 1:03:16.064
<i>That's when he broke down</i>
<i>and told me,</i>

1:03:16.099 --> 1:03:18.000
<i>he said,</i>
<i>"I've been hearing whistles</i>

1:03:18.035 --> 1:03:22.499
<i>and there is something</i>
<i>hitting a tree,</i>

1:03:22.534 --> 1:03:27.977
<i>or there is maybe rocks being</i>
<i>clampered against the ground.</i>

1:03:28.012 --> 1:03:30.474
<i>He did not know either.</i>

1:03:30.509 --> 1:03:32.982
<i>We settled in,</i>
<i>we talked around the campfire.</i>

1:03:33.017 --> 1:03:36.183
<i>It got dark at this point.</i>

1:03:36.218 --> 1:03:39.021
<i>When it gets dark</i>
<i>at Land Between the Lakes,</i>

1:03:39.056 --> 1:03:41.485
<i>it is dark.</i>

1:03:41.520 --> 1:03:44.125
<i>There's no car lights,</i>
<i>there's no street lights.</i>

1:03:44.160 --> 1:03:47.557
<i>It is as if you were</i>
<i>in the 1700 or 1800s.</i>

1:03:50.496 --> 1:03:52.463
<i>We felt like we were</i>
<i>being pressured</i>

1:03:52.498 --> 1:03:54.465
<i>to get out of the camp,</i>

1:03:54.500 --> 1:03:57.270
<i>and this is</i>
<i>when the activity began.</i>

1:03:57.305 --> 1:03:59.833
<i>All that was illuminated,</i>
<i>was our campfire,</i>

1:04:00.572 --> 1:04:02.880
<i>and our kerosene lamp.</i>

1:04:03.872 --> 1:04:05.674
<i>So we had a period of...</i>

1:04:05.709 --> 1:04:09.546
<i>a distance</i>
<i>of 15 to 20 feet at maximum</i>

1:04:09.581 --> 1:04:11.449
<i>around the camp</i>
<i>that would be illuminated,</i>

1:04:11.484 --> 1:04:14.023
<i>and then we would see shadows.</i>

1:04:14.058 --> 1:04:19.490
<i>And I noticed what I believed</i>
<i>to be a man behind a tree.</i>

1:04:19.525 --> 1:04:22.856
<i>It looked as if a person</i>
<i>was standing behind the tree,</i>

1:04:22.891 --> 1:04:24.396
<i>very large tree.</i>

1:04:24.431 --> 1:04:26.101
At that point,
we were locked in.

1:04:26.136 --> 1:04:29.797
We were not going to be made
to move by anything or anybody.

1:04:30.470 --> 1:04:32.140
This was our camp.

1:04:32.175 --> 1:04:34.175
We're staying
and we're gonna hunt here.

1:04:35.937 --> 1:04:40.742
<i>A small limb or tree,</i>
<i>piece of a tree</i>

1:04:40.777 --> 1:04:43.316
<i>come flying off</i>
<i>the top of the cliff</i>

1:04:43.351 --> 1:04:45.285
<i>that was raised above us.</i>

1:04:45.881 --> 1:04:47.518
The rock came,

1:04:47.553 --> 1:04:51.225
and when the rock comes
so close to in between us,

1:04:51.260 --> 1:04:54.426
we were standing within
five to ten foot of each other,

1:04:56.859 --> 1:04:58.760
we started getting scared.

1:05:00.797 --> 1:05:04.139
At one point,
Harry told me that...

1:05:04.174 --> 1:05:07.076
maybe we should get
our firearms,

1:05:07.111 --> 1:05:11.410
and, so he set his shotgun
closer to him.

1:05:11.445 --> 1:05:14.215
My shotgun was laying
on the ground,

1:05:14.250 --> 1:05:17.614
but I had a sidearm on me.

1:05:17.649 --> 1:05:19.451
So, I kind of felt confident.

1:05:22.555 --> 1:05:26.524
<i>You have to imagine</i>
<i>the darkness and</i>
<i>how dark that it was,</i>

1:05:26.559 --> 1:05:29.263
<i>and how limited</i>
<i>vision was for us.</i>

1:05:32.532 --> 1:05:34.862
<i>We began to get a growl</i>

1:05:34.897 --> 1:05:38.932
<i>from where the person</i>
<i>or persons were standing.</i>

1:05:38.967 --> 1:05:44.377
The growl was so intense,
that it vibrated in my chest,

1:05:44.412 --> 1:05:46.445
and within my partner's chest.

1:05:47.580 --> 1:05:49.151
It was like a vibration.

1:05:49.186 --> 1:05:52.055
It was not like a growl
I had ever heard
in my life from...

1:05:52.849 --> 1:05:53.947
I've been around bears,

1:05:53.982 --> 1:05:57.027
I've been around
pigs, charging boars.

1:05:57.062 --> 1:06:00.195
I've been around
all different kinds of animals.

1:06:00.230 --> 1:06:02.857
This was a growl
like I had never heard.

1:06:04.465 --> 1:06:07.994
All my life, I've been trained
not to be afraid.

1:06:08.029 --> 1:06:12.372
I've been trained to attack
anything that comes into vision

1:06:12.407 --> 1:06:14.770
if you perceive it
to be a danger,

1:06:14.805 --> 1:06:18.004
I could not do anything.
It just is...

1:06:18.039 --> 1:06:21.744
<i>It was as if I was this child</i>
<i>and I was five years old,</i>

1:06:21.779 --> 1:06:24.054
<i>and I was scared</i>
<i>of a monster in the dark,</i>

1:06:24.089 --> 1:06:30.852
<i>and I noticed that my partner</i>
<i>was totally frozen.</i>

1:06:30.887 --> 1:06:32.491
<i>He was not moving.</i>

1:06:32.526 --> 1:06:34.163
He was breathing fast.

1:06:35.892 --> 1:06:38.266
At one point
I've seen his shoulders slump,

1:06:39.170 --> 1:06:41.830
and he was not feeling well.

1:06:42.701 --> 1:06:45.306
<i>All time had frozen.</i>

1:06:45.341 --> 1:06:49.640
<i>Everything had just...</i>
<i>like it had become stilled,</i>

1:06:49.675 --> 1:06:56.350
<i>and it It was just a low,</i>
<i>intense feeling that I had.</i>

1:06:56.385 --> 1:07:00.222
<i>Out of the left side</i>
<i>of my peripheral vision,</i>

1:07:00.950 --> 1:07:03.126
<i>I saw movement.</i>

1:07:03.161 --> 1:07:07.394
<i>At this point</i>
<i>I made a physical move,</i>

1:07:07.429 --> 1:07:09.660
and once I took a step,

1:07:09.695 --> 1:07:13.268
I felt like I could...
I just gained, like, my freedom,

1:07:15.371 --> 1:07:16.931
and I pulled my firearm.

1:07:16.966 --> 1:07:20.033
I turned my shoulders
to face the object

1:07:20.068 --> 1:07:23.080
that I caught
in my peripheral vision.

1:07:24.149 --> 1:07:27.007
I faced... I looked forward,

1:07:27.042 --> 1:07:31.682
and I could see
what I knew was not a man.

1:07:31.717 --> 1:07:36.258
<i>I knew that it was not</i>
<i>an animal I had ever seen,</i>

1:07:37.558 --> 1:07:40.229
<i>and it was coming towards me.</i>

1:07:40.264 --> 1:07:42.957
<i>In the glow of the campfire</i>

1:07:42.992 --> 1:07:46.499
<i>and the glow</i>
<i>of my kerosene lamp,</i>

1:07:46.534 --> 1:07:51.768
<i>I caught what I felt</i>
<i>was an upright walking...</i>

1:07:51.803 --> 1:07:55.068
<i>It was not bear.</i>
<i>It was like a wolf.</i>

1:07:55.103 --> 1:07:59.776
It was large, it was huge.
It was still walking towards me.

1:07:59.811 --> 1:08:04.583
I've discharged my weapon
in its direction two times.

1:08:04.618 --> 1:08:06.288
You have to imagine

1:08:06.323 --> 1:08:09.819
when you fire a gun
at nighttime,

1:08:09.854 --> 1:08:12.921
that you have an effect

1:08:12.956 --> 1:08:15.561
of almost like a camera
going off,

1:08:15.596 --> 1:08:18.058
and that camera instills
something in your brain,

1:08:18.093 --> 1:08:20.764
so, I have this image.

1:08:20.799 --> 1:08:24.603
instilled in my head
of when the flash went out.

1:08:26.277 --> 1:08:28.706
<i>And the animal...</i>

1:08:30.644 --> 1:08:33.447
<i>It was like it responded</i>
<i>to the firearm.</i>

1:08:33.482 --> 1:08:35.075
<i>It was intelligent.</i>

1:08:35.110 --> 1:08:37.286
<i>It knew that that...</i>

1:08:37.321 --> 1:08:40.850
firearm was dangerous to it,
because it reacted,

1:08:40.885 --> 1:08:44.260
it moved and it went
backwards before I fired.

1:08:44.295 --> 1:08:47.725
<i>It is as if</i>
<i>it could jump and leap</i>

1:08:47.760 --> 1:08:51.201
beyond any human understanding.

1:08:51.236 --> 1:08:53.269
It jumped to the rock face

1:08:53.304 --> 1:08:55.832
that was beside of it,

1:08:55.867 --> 1:08:59.572
and in an instant was...
it was gone.

1:08:59.607 --> 1:09:03.675
It disappeared and went
over the ridge above us.

1:09:03.710 --> 1:09:06.480
When I fired my weapon,

1:09:06.515 --> 1:09:10.385
my hunting partner behind me
discharged his firearm,

1:09:10.420 --> 1:09:12.948
in the opposite direction of me.

1:09:12.983 --> 1:09:14.554
I am screaming at this point.

1:09:14.589 --> 1:09:16.985
I'm screaming, I don't even know
what I'm saying,

1:09:17.020 --> 1:09:19.757
but it's time
to back up to the truck

1:09:19.792 --> 1:09:23.992
where we were parked,
and I began to cover above me.

1:09:24.027 --> 1:09:27.127
I covered to the left of me,
and he's walking,

1:09:27.162 --> 1:09:28.667
<i>and we're walking behind us.</i>

1:09:30.671 --> 1:09:32.275
<i>As we get to the truck,</i>

1:09:32.310 --> 1:09:35.377
<i>I jump up into the back-end</i>
<i>of the pickup truck.</i>

1:09:35.412 --> 1:09:39.139
<i>He gets in, cranks the vehicle.</i>
<i>I am standing in the back</i>

1:09:39.174 --> 1:09:44.045
<i>of the pickup truck,</i>
<i>the lights,</i>
<i>flow towards a field</i>

1:09:44.080 --> 1:09:46.179
<i>that was in front of us.</i>

1:09:46.214 --> 1:09:47.752
<i>Directly in front of me...</i>

1:09:48.986 --> 1:09:53.692
<i>were two huge figures,</i>
<i>creatures.</i>

1:09:53.727 --> 1:09:57.564
<i>I believe that what</i>
<i>was stalking</i>
<i>me in the woods,</i>

1:09:57.599 --> 1:10:03.196
<i>I believe that whatever I fired</i>
<i>at to the left of my camp,</i>

1:10:03.231 --> 1:10:08.234
<i>was what people</i>
<i>refer to as a Dogman.</i>

1:10:08.269 --> 1:10:11.138
<i>But I know what was</i>
<i>in the headlights</i>
<i>of that truck,</i>

1:10:11.173 --> 1:10:13.173
<i>was not the same creature,</i>

1:10:13.208 --> 1:10:17.320
because it towered at least
another two or three foot taller

1:10:17.355 --> 1:10:20.422
than the animals
that I had seen in my camp.

1:10:20.457 --> 1:10:23.722
These were two
very large creatures,

1:10:23.757 --> 1:10:25.394
and I realized that one of them

1:10:25.429 --> 1:10:28.925
was the exact thing
that I had seen in the distance,

1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:31.433
that I believed to be a man
in a ghillie suit,

1:10:31.468 --> 1:10:33.666
and it was not a man
in a ghillie suit.

1:10:33.701 --> 1:10:35.899
It was not a bear.

1:10:35.934 --> 1:10:40.134
It was on two legs, bipedal.

1:10:40.169 --> 1:10:43.775
That's what I believe
was whistling the entire time

1:10:43.810 --> 1:10:46.107
that I had heard in the woods.

1:10:46.142 --> 1:10:48.879
That's what my partner
had heard whistling,

1:10:48.914 --> 1:10:52.146
were the two figures
that I observed in the field

1:10:52.181 --> 1:10:53.620
in front of me.

1:10:53.655 --> 1:10:55.391
Were they working

1:10:55.426 --> 1:10:57.250
with the other animals?

1:10:57.285 --> 1:10:58.251
I just say the words.

1:10:58.286 --> 1:11:00.891
Were they working
with the Dogman?

1:11:00.926 --> 1:11:03.091
Were they guiding the Dogman,

1:11:03.126 --> 1:11:08.734
or were there...
Were the two large creatures

1:11:08.769 --> 1:11:10.670
there to protect me?

1:11:10.705 --> 1:11:12.199
I do not know.

1:11:12.234 --> 1:11:15.103
My partner
fires up the pickup truck,

1:11:15.138 --> 1:11:18.304
and we speed out of the area.

1:11:18.339 --> 1:11:23.243
As I turn around behind me,
something was tearing my...

1:11:23.278 --> 1:11:26.114
our camp completely to pieces.

1:11:30.494 --> 1:11:33.495
<i>There are Bigfoot</i>
<i>stories from the region.</i>

1:11:33.530 --> 1:11:35.464
<i>There's supposedly a large,</i>
<i>aggressive Bigfoot</i>

1:11:35.499 --> 1:11:37.059
<i>in Land Between the Lakes.</i>

1:11:37.094 --> 1:11:40.260
<i>It just goes wherever it wants.</i>
<i>They've nicknamed it Stonefoot.</i>

1:11:40.295 --> 1:11:42.405
<i>And, we even have found</i>

1:11:42.440 --> 1:11:44.539
<i>Bigfoot tracks</i>
<i>up towards the north,</i>

1:11:44.574 --> 1:11:47.102
close to around the site
where the family was attacked.

1:11:47.137 --> 1:11:49.038
So, they are in the park.

1:11:51.306 --> 1:11:53.482
- <i> We stopped</i>
<i>and we attempted to report</i>

1:11:53.517 --> 1:11:55.979
<i>what took place with us,</i>

1:11:56.014 --> 1:12:00.852
<i>and we were told</i>
<i>that we had overreacted,</i>

1:12:00.887 --> 1:12:04.724
that we had observed
what they said was a rogue bear.

1:12:04.759 --> 1:12:07.188
There are things
that I will not say on camera.

1:12:07.223 --> 1:12:10.158
People that I've spoken
with over the years.

1:12:10.193 --> 1:12:11.533
You have to understand

1:12:11.568 --> 1:12:14.899
that the law enforcement field
is a tight brethren.

1:12:14.934 --> 1:12:17.968
There is a unwritten rule
that you will not talk

1:12:18.003 --> 1:12:20.267
of anything
coming out of the park.

1:12:20.302 --> 1:12:22.038
I mean, these guys
have pensions,

1:12:22.073 --> 1:12:23.710
these guys have family.

1:12:23.745 --> 1:12:27.340
Can you imagine working
for somewhere for 20 or 30 years

1:12:27.375 --> 1:12:29.078
and you are called
into the office

1:12:29.113 --> 1:12:31.344
and you are told
that, due to the fact

1:12:31.379 --> 1:12:33.280
you spoke
in public about an incident

1:12:33.315 --> 1:12:36.019
that took place,
that you're fired?

1:12:36.054 --> 1:12:39.220
I believe it's entirely possible
that they cover stuff like that.

1:12:39.255 --> 1:12:41.662
They'd lose a lot of money
if people learned

1:12:41.697 --> 1:12:43.697
that there was something
that looked like a werewolf

1:12:43.732 --> 1:12:46.392
wandering through the park,
or possibly even Bigfoot.

1:12:46.427 --> 1:12:47.767
<i>They'd lose a lot of money.</i>

1:12:47.802 --> 1:12:51.804
<i>So, if one person disappears,</i>
<i>or a few people,</i>

1:12:51.839 --> 1:12:53.905
<i>wouldn't it be for them,</i>

1:12:53.940 --> 1:12:55.401
<i>wouldn't it be</i>
<i>the most profitable decision</i>

1:12:55.436 --> 1:12:56.677
<i>to just cover it up</i>
<i>and make it look</i>

1:12:56.712 --> 1:12:58.481
<i>like something never happened?</i>

1:12:58.516 --> 1:13:01.011
At this point,
there are many people

1:13:01.046 --> 1:13:04.080
that have went missing,
or have come up,

1:13:04.115 --> 1:13:07.413
they've been found dead
within the park.

1:13:07.448 --> 1:13:10.350
<i>And this is a phenomenon</i>
<i>that it is not contained</i>

1:13:10.385 --> 1:13:12.528
<i>to Land Between the Lakes.</i>

1:13:12.563 --> 1:13:15.696
<i>This has taken place</i>
<i>in a lot of our national parks.</i>

1:13:15.731 --> 1:13:18.391
<i>It is a very scary thought</i>
<i>that the general public</i>

1:13:18.426 --> 1:13:20.602
<i>is tourism.</i>

1:13:20.637 --> 1:13:23.737
<i>To a certain extent,</i>
<i>the general public is unarmed</i>

1:13:23.772 --> 1:13:25.541
<i>when they enter these parks,</i>

1:13:25.576 --> 1:13:29.941
<i>unable to defend themselves</i>
<i>against anything, man or beast.</i>

1:13:32.616 --> 1:13:34.209
From all the encounters

1:13:34.244 --> 1:13:35.782
that I have talked
to people with,

1:13:35.817 --> 1:13:38.653
it's just not
simply encountering

1:13:38.688 --> 1:13:40.556
an animal out there.

1:13:40.591 --> 1:13:41.821
<i>There are earth lights</i>

1:13:41.856 --> 1:13:43.383
<i>often attached</i>
<i>to these sightings.</i>

1:13:43.418 --> 1:13:47.288
There are feelings of dread
associated with this.

1:13:47.323 --> 1:13:50.698
In my opinion,
what we were dealing with here

1:13:50.733 --> 1:13:54.801
is not a human simply
shape-shifting into an animal,

1:13:54.836 --> 1:13:57.463
<i>or some sort</i>
<i>of uncatalogued creature</i>

1:13:57.498 --> 1:13:59.707
<i>that is roaming</i>
<i>the wilds of America</i>

1:13:59.742 --> 1:14:02.270
<i>that has yet</i>
<i>to be categorized by science.</i>

1:14:02.305 --> 1:14:04.305
<i>I think there is something here</i>

1:14:04.340 --> 1:14:07.913
<i>that is far beyond</i>
<i>our knowledge.</i>

1:14:07.948 --> 1:14:12.478
<i>It appears as if</i>
<i>these creatures</i>
<i>are coming from another source,</i>

1:14:12.513 --> 1:14:14.447
<i>and they bleed into our world,</i>

1:14:14.482 --> 1:14:16.790
or we bleed into their world,
or what have you.

1:14:16.825 --> 1:14:20.321
There almost has to be
an unspoken agreement

1:14:20.356 --> 1:14:23.258
between the person that is
witnessing these creatures,

1:14:23.293 --> 1:14:24.930
and the creatures themselves.

1:14:24.965 --> 1:14:27.999
It seems there is some sort
of exchange of energy going on,

1:14:28.034 --> 1:14:30.331
and for these things
to manifest themselves,

1:14:30.366 --> 1:14:32.267
they would need your energy

1:14:32.302 --> 1:14:35.270
to feed off,
to make almost a circuit

1:14:35.305 --> 1:14:36.843
in which everything is fired up,

1:14:36.878 --> 1:14:39.615
and then these things
can then appear

1:14:39.650 --> 1:14:41.375
and manifest within our reality.

1:14:48.021 --> 1:14:50.351
<i>It bothered me for years.</i>

1:14:50.386 --> 1:14:53.090
<i>I'm not saying that I had</i>
<i>post-traumatic stress.</i>

1:14:53.125 --> 1:14:54.630
<i>I'm not saying that,</i>

1:14:54.665 --> 1:14:56.192
<i>but I know that every time</i>

1:14:56.227 --> 1:14:59.162
<i>I walked out of my house</i>
<i>at night,</i>

1:14:59.197 --> 1:15:02.462
I was always had this fear

1:15:02.497 --> 1:15:04.299
of what's lurking
behind the house.

1:15:04.334 --> 1:15:05.575
What could be under the car?

1:15:05.610 --> 1:15:07.368
What could be behind that bush,

1:15:07.403 --> 1:15:10.140
because in the back
of my mind, it's always there.

1:15:10.175 --> 1:15:11.647
It could be there.

1:15:11.682 --> 1:15:13.242
And the other thing that really
kind of stuck out to me,

1:15:13.277 --> 1:15:15.376
was, as I sat back
and I reflected,

1:15:15.411 --> 1:15:18.819
was, if that thing's real,
what the hell else is real?

1:15:23.727 --> 1:15:25.353
- <i> I didn't let it</i>
<i>control my life,</i>

1:15:25.388 --> 1:15:27.729
<i>and as a matter of fact,</i>

1:15:27.764 --> 1:15:30.358
<i>I kind of swept it into the...</i>

1:15:30.393 --> 1:15:33.163
<i>into the back recesses</i>
<i>of my mind,</i>

1:15:33.198 --> 1:15:35.528
<i>and now and again</i>
<i>it would come up.</i>

1:15:35.563 --> 1:15:37.739
<i>I get the pin pricks</i>
<i>in the back of my neck,</i>

1:15:37.774 --> 1:15:39.532
<i>and I think I'm just...</i>

1:15:39.567 --> 1:15:41.710
<i>Too much imagination.</i>

1:15:41.745 --> 1:15:44.647
<i>I hid this from myself.</i>

1:15:44.682 --> 1:15:46.682
<i>I would...</i>
<i>I rarely told anyone,</i>

1:15:46.717 --> 1:15:50.543
because you tell someone,
and yeah,

1:15:50.578 --> 1:15:52.985
they're condescending at best,

1:15:53.020 --> 1:15:56.054
just laugh,
or think you're joking, and...

1:15:56.089 --> 1:15:58.353
Now, at this age, I don't care

1:15:58.388 --> 1:16:01.521
whether you believe me or not,
it doesn't matter.

1:16:01.556 --> 1:16:02.962
It happened.

1:16:05.626 --> 1:16:08.066
- <i> The only thing</i>
<i>I could literally tell people</i>

1:16:08.101 --> 1:16:09.199
<i>I saw was a werewolf,</i>

1:16:09.234 --> 1:16:10.497
<i>which probably didn't help</i>
<i>the fact</i>

1:16:10.532 --> 1:16:12.598
<i>that people</i>
<i>thought I was crazy.</i>

1:16:12.633 --> 1:16:13.841
<i>And like I've told her,</i>

1:16:13.876 --> 1:16:15.744
<i>every time</i>
<i>I talk about it to anybody,</i>

1:16:15.779 --> 1:16:17.372
<i>the nightmares come back.</i>

1:16:19.046 --> 1:16:20.650
<i>I 've woke up</i>
<i>screaming in the night.</i>

1:16:20.685 --> 1:16:23.411
<i>My wife shook me.</i>

1:16:23.446 --> 1:16:25.754
<i>It scares me to my core</i>
<i>to know that these things</i>

1:16:25.789 --> 1:16:27.888
<i>are still out there,</i>
<i>moving and walking around.</i>

1:16:29.056 --> 1:16:31.485
<i>These things are built</i>
<i>to hurt something.</i>

1:16:34.699 --> 1:16:36.798
<i>Trust me, you don't want</i>
<i>to see one.</i>

1:16:42.168 --> 1:16:45.466
- <i> I have nightmares.</i>
<i>I'm plagued with dreams.</i>

1:16:45.501 --> 1:16:47.534
<i>At one point,</i>
<i>I spoke with a professional</i>

1:16:47.569 --> 1:16:50.603
<i>that said that I had...</i>
<i>I had seen something,</i>

1:16:50.638 --> 1:16:53.309
<i>that had traumatized my memory.</i>

1:16:53.344 --> 1:16:56.543
<i>I couldn't accept</i>
<i>what I had saw.</i>

1:16:56.578 --> 1:17:00.756
<i>That trauma of whatever</i>
<i>that had occurred that night,</i>

1:17:00.791 --> 1:17:03.286
<i>and the incident</i>
<i>that I had seen,</i>

1:17:03.321 --> 1:17:05.552
<i>that... It will haunt me.</i>

1:17:05.587 --> 1:17:07.895
<i>It will be in my dreams.</i>

1:17:07.930 --> 1:17:12.031
<i>They told me</i>
<i>to attempt to work it out.</i>

1:17:12.066 --> 1:17:13.934
<i>I will not hunt</i>

1:17:13.969 --> 1:17:16.101
in the deep woods any longer.

1:17:16.136 --> 1:17:17.839
I have been to different states,

1:17:17.874 --> 1:17:22.206
I have hunted in Montana,
I have hunted in Wyoming.

1:17:25.310 --> 1:17:27.783
I have fished where
I've had grizzly bears

1:17:27.818 --> 1:17:31.017
within 20 to 30 yards of me
when I'm fly fishing.

1:17:31.712 --> 1:17:33.514
They don't scare me.

1:17:33.549 --> 1:17:34.614
That scares me.

1:17:34.649 --> 1:17:36.484
What I saw that night,

1:17:36.519 --> 1:17:40.763
was such an intense feeling,
an evil...

1:17:40.798 --> 1:17:41.764
A feeling of evil
that cannot be described.
