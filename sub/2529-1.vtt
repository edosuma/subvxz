00:21.160 --> 00:22.650
Kabul, Afghanistan,

00:22.695 --> 00:24.094
4:00 in the morning.

00:26.399 --> 00:27.889
As an American journalist,

00:27.934 --> 00:30.061
I was used to filing stories
in the middle of the night.

00:31.471 --> 00:33.462
But there's always
something eerie

00:33.506 --> 00:35.498
driving through the
deserted streets.

00:36.710 --> 00:38.939
A city of 3 million-

00:38.978 --> 00:40.605
barely a streetlight on.

00:45.384 --> 00:47.216
It was a familiar routine:

00:47.254 --> 00:49.051
Waiting for the crew to
light up the night sky

00:49.089 --> 00:51.215
so you could see something
in the background.

00:53.025 --> 00:55.425
But could we really see?

00:55.461 --> 00:57.656
Well, Keith, greetings
from Kabul, Afghanistan,

00:57.697 --> 00:59.790
where the U.S. Ambassador
Karl Eikenberry...

00:59.832 --> 01:02.494
This is a story about the seen

01:02.535 --> 01:04.126
and the unseen...

01:07.874 --> 01:10.001
And about things
hidden in plain sight.

01:21.420 --> 01:23.821
It's hard to say when
this story began.

01:23.856 --> 01:25.721
I'd been working
as a war reporter

01:25.758 --> 01:27.350
for more than a decade

01:27.393 --> 01:30.829
in Yugoslavia, Iraq,
and now Afghanistan.

01:33.399 --> 01:34.798
After nearly ten years,

01:34.834 --> 01:37.326
the war here wasn't
exactly breaking news.

01:38.605 --> 01:39.629
I think there's, like-

01:39.673 --> 01:41.105
there's, like, eight rakes.

01:43.309 --> 01:44.640
One, two, three...

01:46.112 --> 01:47.238
We haven't been out here.

01:47.280 --> 01:48.508
What's the name of
this village out here?

01:48.548 --> 01:49.515
Oh, I have no idea.

01:49.549 --> 01:50.538
They all blend in for me.

01:50.583 --> 01:51.709
Yeah.

01:58.858 --> 02:00.758
What's the focus of
your campaign here?

02:00.793 --> 02:02.090
In southern Nangarhar,

02:02.128 --> 02:04.562
we're dealing with the Ashkar-

02:04.597 --> 02:06.064
Ashkael-

02:06.098 --> 02:08.828
uh, Asherkeil tribe.

02:08.868 --> 02:11.234
You know, the wording,
uh, I'll get right

02:11.270 --> 02:13.534
probably when we leave
next year, but...

02:13.573 --> 02:15.097
This was supposed to
be the front line

02:15.141 --> 02:16.267
in the war on terror.

02:18.511 --> 02:21.309
From Kabul out on an
exercise with the military

02:21.347 --> 02:22.905
and back to Kabul,

02:22.949 --> 02:26.545
the Afghan Press Corps
was locked in a bubble.

02:26.587 --> 02:28.555
We were told that the
battle for hearts and minds

02:28.589 --> 02:29.555
was being won

02:29.589 --> 02:30.681
as soldiers dug wells

02:30.723 --> 02:32.588
or drank tea with tribal elders.

02:35.261 --> 02:37.559
But I knew I was
missing the story.

02:40.166 --> 02:41.428
There was another war,

02:41.467 --> 02:43.196
hinted at in press conferences

02:43.236 --> 02:45.466
and detailed in each
morning's press release.

02:47.273 --> 02:49.867
December 14th, Zabul Province,

02:49.909 --> 02:51.433
a night raid.

02:51.477 --> 02:53.172
Four Taliban killed,

02:53.212 --> 02:55.077
three detained for questioning.

02:55.114 --> 02:56.809
No civilians injured.

02:58.885 --> 03:00.682
No one at NATO would
give us anything more

03:00.720 --> 03:02.915
than the lists of
nighttime raids.

03:02.955 --> 03:05.389
No one even seemed to know
who was doing the raids.

03:06.993 --> 03:09.223
And I wasn't going to find
out if I stayed in Kabul.

03:32.755 --> 03:36.801
POLICE HEADQUARTERS
JALALABAD, AFGHANISTAN

03:37.552 --> 03:43.141
This is the third raid in my district.

03:43.391 --> 03:47.812
13 or 14 people
have been killed in all.

03:48.062 --> 03:50.356
They were innocent people.

03:50.658 --> 03:52.092
So what you're saying

03:52.138 --> 03:53.605
is that the Americans
will come into a district

03:53.639 --> 03:54.765
where you're the
police commander,

03:54.807 --> 03:56.741
and they won't inform you
that they're gonna carry out

03:56.776 --> 03:58.252
this kind of action
in your district.

03:58.364 --> 04:06.206
I've asked the American
soldiers that come to my district.

04:06.456 --> 04:08.457
But even the main
NATO base here says

04:08.487 --> 04:11.168
they don't know
anything about the raids.

04:11.198 --> 04:14.214
The troops came
from another base.

04:22.902 --> 04:24.369
So there's the two-

04:24.403 --> 04:26.735
the two men in the guesthouse
were the first people killed.

04:29.275 --> 04:31.971
And then...

04:33.279 --> 04:34.268
The farmer from here.

04:35.381 --> 04:36.973
- Yeah.
- And then another farmer.

04:37.016 --> 04:38.040
Two.
Two of his sons.

04:38.084 --> 04:39.346
Two.

04:39.385 --> 04:40.409
- Mm-hmm.
- Two of his sons.

04:40.453 --> 04:41.647
So there's, I think-
so seven.

04:41.687 --> 04:42.745
Or two-

04:42.788 --> 04:44.221
- Two, two---four.
One farmer---five.

04:44.256 --> 04:45.245
Two these---
seven.

04:45.291 --> 04:48.055
Two...

04:54.462 --> 04:56.463
The Americans will say anything.

04:56.493 --> 05:01.135
The Americans will say anything,
everyone knows that.

05:01.469 --> 05:03.429
If the Americans do this again,

05:03.596 --> 05:06.557
we are ready to shed
our blood fighting them.

05:07.642 --> 05:12.438
We would rather die than
sit by and do nothing.

05:25.531 --> 05:27.396
The list of raids from
NATO press releases

05:27.433 --> 05:29.367
read like a map of a hidden war.

05:33.039 --> 05:35.769
The military divided the roads
in Afghanistan by color.

05:36.575 --> 05:37.872
Green was safe.

05:37.910 --> 05:39.104
Red was dangerous.

05:39.145 --> 05:40.169
And black?

05:40.212 --> 05:41.339
Don't even try it.

05:43.116 --> 05:44.378
Most of the raids were happening

05:44.418 --> 05:46.009
far beyond the green zone

05:46.052 --> 05:48.850
in what the military
called "denied areas"...

05:50.256 --> 05:51.848
Places where journalists
never show up

05:51.891 --> 05:52.949
to ask questions.

05:56.395 --> 05:57.919
NATO, the U.S. Embassy,

05:57.963 --> 05:59.123
and my own better judgment

05:59.165 --> 06:02.032
all advised against
traveling there.

06:02.068 --> 06:04.161
But I'd read about
a raid in Gardez,

06:04.203 --> 06:06.397
half a day's drive
in Paktia Province.

06:09.442 --> 06:11.808
I pushed as far as I
could into the gray area

06:11.844 --> 06:14.278
on the fraying edge
of NATO's control,

06:14.313 --> 06:15.780
past rusting Russian tanks

06:15.815 --> 06:17.976
and bombed-out NATO
supply convoys.

06:20.219 --> 06:22.710
Two other journalists had
been kidnapped on this road,

06:22.755 --> 06:23.983
and after weeks

06:24.023 --> 06:25.854
in the military's
armored vehicles,

06:25.891 --> 06:28.724
our Toyota felt
thin-skinned and fragile.

06:30.897 --> 06:33.525
I knew I had to be back
in Kabul before sunset,

06:33.567 --> 06:35.727
when the Taliban took
control of the roads.

06:36.735 --> 06:37.963
But I had no idea how far

06:38.003 --> 06:39.971
my visit to Gardez
would lead me.

06:40.193 --> 06:43.237
GARDEZ
PAKTIA PROVINCE

06:45.281 --> 06:47.074
This is my son,
and this is my son,

06:47.104 --> 06:49.076
and this is my
daughter-in-law,

06:49.106 --> 06:51.204
and this is my granddaughter.

06:51.829 --> 06:56.834
They killed them
all on a single day.

06:57.293 --> 07:02.382
Two of the women they
killed were pregnant.

07:02.548 --> 07:06.552
One was 5 months, the
other was 4 months pregnant.

07:07.762 --> 07:09.806
A child had been
born in our home

07:10.014 --> 07:13.059
and we had organized
a party to celebrate.

07:14.644 --> 07:18.731
We invited many
guests and had music.

07:20.525 --> 07:24.152
During the party,
people were dancing

07:24.182 --> 07:28.699
our traditional dance, the attan.

07:41.462 --> 07:46.509
The American forces came
between 3:30 and 4:00 am.

07:47.343 --> 07:49.719
Daoud went to see
what was happening.

07:49.749 --> 07:51.806
He thought the
Taliban had come.

07:53.599 --> 07:56.644
They were already
on the roof.

08:00.273 --> 08:03.525
They shot Daoud as
soon as he stepped outside.

08:03.555 --> 08:05.736
All the children were shouting,

08:05.903 --> 08:08.865
"Daoud is shot!
Daoud is shot!"

08:09.031 --> 08:11.283
We brought Daoud in here.

08:11.313 --> 08:12.576
The women grabbed Zaher.

08:12.606 --> 08:15.746
They told him not to
go or he would be killed.

08:15.913 --> 08:17.748
But they opened fire.

08:18.624 --> 08:21.752
They killed three women,
along with Zaher.

08:21.919 --> 08:27.061
My wife, my sister,
and my niece.

08:27.091 --> 08:31.053
Look at these
patched bullet holes.

08:39.024 --> 08:40.889
Was Mr. Daoud
killed immediately,

08:40.926 --> 08:43.010
or did he live for a
while after he was shot?

08:43.039 --> 08:48.154
Daoud and my sister-in-law
were alive until 7:00 am.

08:49.071 --> 08:53.034
They didn't let us take
them to the hospital.

08:53.534 --> 08:58.706
The Americans used knives to dig
the bullets out of their bodies.

08:58.945 --> 09:01.913
They pulled out the
bullets from their body.

09:01.947 --> 09:04.074
You saw the U.S. Forces

09:04.116 --> 09:05.913
take the bullets
out of the body?

09:06.964 --> 09:08.216
Ja.

09:12.678 --> 09:15.515
They tied our
hands and blindfolded us.

09:16.849 --> 09:18.226
Two people grabbed us.

09:18.392 --> 09:21.479
They pushed us one
by one into the aircraft.

09:23.481 --> 09:25.483
They flew us
to another province.

09:26.984 --> 09:28.236
To Paktika.

09:31.143 --> 09:33.907
So he had just seen his wife
killed by the American forces,

09:33.946 --> 09:37.245
and then he himself was taken
prisoner by the Americans.

09:37.283 --> 09:39.274
What was going through his
head when they took him?

09:39.539 --> 09:42.457
My senses weren't
working at all. I couldn't cry.

09:42.487 --> 09:45.002
I was numb and
didn't feel a thing.

09:45.169 --> 09:49.215
I didn't eat for
three days and nights.

09:49.382 --> 09:52.802
My hands and clothes
were caked with blood.

09:52.969 --> 09:57.139
They didn't give us water
to wash the blood away.

09:57.390 --> 10:01.268
The interrogators had beards
and didn't wear American uniforms.

10:01.298 --> 10:07.411
They had big muscles.
Sometimes they acted nice.

10:07.441 --> 10:09.526
And sometimes
they would shake us.

10:09.556 --> 10:11.069
By the time I got home,

10:11.099 --> 10:15.032
all our dead had
already been buried.

10:15.199 --> 10:19.131
Only my father and my brother were left
at home. I didn't want to live anymore.

10:19.161 --> 10:21.509
I wanted to wear a suicide jacket

10:21.539 --> 10:25.001
and blow myself up
among the Americans.

10:25.167 --> 10:27.223
But my brother and my
father wouldn't let me.

10:27.253 --> 10:29.922
I wanted Jihad
against the Americans.

10:34.969 --> 10:38.347
MOHAMMED DAOUD
1:00 AM - FEBRUARY 12, 2010

10:45.980 --> 10:48.941
MOHAMMED DAOUD
2:00 PM - FEBRUARY 12, 2010

11:26.993 --> 11:28.289
The family had no idea

11:28.327 --> 11:30.022
what led the Americans
to their home.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.152
MOHAMMED DAOUD
POLICE COMMANDER, GARDEZ

11:33.598 --> 11:35.828
They had long fought
against the Taliban,

11:35.867 --> 11:37.630
and Daoud was a police commander

11:37.668 --> 11:40.297
who'd been through dozens
of U.S. training programs.

11:40.451 --> 11:42.506
This is my son,
the Police Commander.

11:42.536 --> 11:44.121
Was he Taliban?

11:49.669 --> 11:53.005
They said they had information
that 50 Taliban were here.

11:53.172 --> 11:58.010
But they were all my relatives,
and they worked for the government.

11:58.177 --> 12:01.639
They killed my innocent sons,
daughter, and daughter-in-law.

12:01.847 --> 12:08.604
They had committed no
sin and had no enemies.

12:12.704 --> 12:14.297
As we prepared to leave,

12:14.340 --> 12:16.570
Daoud's granddaughter
spoke to us,

12:16.609 --> 12:19.702
but only later would I know
the meaning of her words.

12:31.323 --> 12:33.553
Daoud's family told
me it was time to go.

12:33.592 --> 12:35.924
The sun sets early
in the mountains,

12:35.961 --> 12:37.656
and the night belongs
to the Taliban.

12:59.154 --> 13:00.906
So the highway is closed.

13:07.037 --> 13:10.833
I think there is an attack from Taliban.

13:15.534 --> 13:17.832
The gunfire continued,

13:17.870 --> 13:19.861
and it was now obvious
how dangerous,

13:19.905 --> 13:21.964
maybe even reckless
the trip had been.

13:25.277 --> 13:26.710
Mm-hmm.

13:29.381 --> 13:32.373
NATO wasted no time
issuing a report.

13:32.417 --> 13:33.941
They claimed that the
women killed in Gardez

13:33.986 --> 13:36.420
were the victims of a
Taliban honor killing,

13:36.455 --> 13:37.581
bound and gagged

13:37.623 --> 13:40.183
by their own murderous families.

13:40.225 --> 13:42.193
You saw the U.S. Forces

13:42.227 --> 13:43.990
take the bullets
out of the body?

13:49.968 --> 13:51.128
I believed the family,

13:51.169 --> 13:53.400
but that wasn't enough

13:53.439 --> 13:55.564
for me or anyone else.

13:55.606 --> 13:57.506
[Speaking indistinctly]

13:57.542 --> 13:59.703
Who were these men that
stormed into Daoud's home?

14:01.146 --> 14:03.011
And why would they go to
such horrifying lengths

14:03.048 --> 14:04.481
to cover up their actions?

14:05.054 --> 14:08.224
Tamana.
Who did the Americans kill?

14:10.726 --> 14:13.604
They killed my grandfather...

14:13.854 --> 14:15.815
...and Gulalai.

14:16.065 --> 14:19.235
And they killed Agha Abdulnoor.

14:27.906 --> 14:29.032
All right.

14:29.074 --> 14:30.564
Ready? Yeah.

14:30.609 --> 14:32.941
One, two, three.

14:42.621 --> 14:43.781
Good morning.

14:43.822 --> 14:45.948
The subcommittee
will come to order.

14:45.990 --> 14:49.119
The subject is
national security.

14:49.265 --> 14:52.226
HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
WASHINGTON, DC

14:53.332 --> 14:54.993
If my esteemed friend,

14:55.033 --> 14:56.398
the gentleman from Michigan,

14:56.435 --> 14:58.232
wishes to continue
with this hearing,

14:58.270 --> 14:59.532
I think that's fine.

14:59.571 --> 15:01.766
He is the chairman.

15:01.807 --> 15:02.933
But next year,

15:02.975 --> 15:05.603
when this committee is
under new management,

15:05.644 --> 15:07.475
we won't be looking
at the calendar

15:07.512 --> 15:09.571
of last year or two years ago.

15:09.615 --> 15:10.707
Thank you.

15:12.851 --> 15:15.445
Far from discussing
the distant past,

15:15.487 --> 15:17.148
I'd like to share
with this committee

15:17.189 --> 15:19.885
part of my investigation into
deadly U.S. night raids...

15:19.925 --> 15:22.223
Sensenbrenner walked out,

15:22.260 --> 15:23.921
but no one else even
bothered to show up...

15:25.330 --> 15:26.888
Just Chairman Conyers
and his staffers.

15:26.932 --> 15:28.899
In closing, Mr. Ohairman,
I told these families

15:28.933 --> 15:31.425
that I'd bring their cases
before the U.S. Congress

15:31.470 --> 15:32.993
and ask that they
be investigated

15:33.037 --> 15:35.506
and that those responsible
be held accountable.

15:35.540 --> 15:36.700
On behalf of those families...

15:36.742 --> 15:38.073
It didn't surprise me

15:38.110 --> 15:40.738
that Washington wasn't
interested in Gardez.

15:40.779 --> 15:42.644
As an investigative reporter,

15:42.681 --> 15:44.444
you rarely have
people's attention.

15:45.651 --> 15:48.381
More often than not,
you work alone,

15:48.420 --> 15:51.253
and the stories you labor
over fall on deaf ears.

15:52.658 --> 15:54.956
But sometimes a story
strikes a nerve,

15:54.993 --> 15:57.723
and you're thrown into
the public arena.

15:57.763 --> 15:59.560
It happened to me once before.

15:59.598 --> 16:00.656
During its time in Iraq,

16:00.699 --> 16:02.690
Blackwater has regularly
engaged in firefights

16:02.734 --> 16:03.996
and other deadly incidents...

16:04.036 --> 16:05.594
It was 2007,

16:05.637 --> 16:07.264
and I was reporting
on Blackwater,

16:07.305 --> 16:09.535
a shadowy mercenary company,

16:09.574 --> 16:11.701
and suddenly it was
front-page news.

16:11.743 --> 16:13.711
A frequent contributor
to The Nation magazine,

16:13.745 --> 16:15.177
his new book is
called Blackwater.

16:15.212 --> 16:16.975
Jeremy Scahill, who authored
the book Blackwater...

16:17.014 --> 16:18.072
Who's come to us from London...

16:18.115 --> 16:19.480
Joining me now is
Jeremy Scahill.

16:19.517 --> 16:20.576
I quickly discovered

16:20.619 --> 16:22.712
that the world of
talk show television

16:22.754 --> 16:24.244
is less a meeting
place for ideas

16:24.289 --> 16:25.756
and more like a boxing ring.

16:25.791 --> 16:26.917
That is hooey.

16:26.958 --> 16:28.152
$700 million

16:28.193 --> 16:30.024
for a colonial
fortress in Pakistan.

16:30.062 --> 16:32.394
The whole thing
feels like a game.

16:32.431 --> 16:34.365
But every time you
step into the ring,

16:34.399 --> 16:36.731
there's a chance your
story can have an impact.

16:36.768 --> 16:38.326
Journalists have done nothing

16:38.370 --> 16:40.065
to hold the White House
accountable now,

16:40.105 --> 16:41.663
Chuck, or under Bush.

16:41.707 --> 16:42.799
Let me get to the story-

16:42.841 --> 16:43.899
- Why are you still alive?

16:43.942 --> 16:44.966
Are you paranoid?

16:46.211 --> 16:47.508
No, I'm serious. I'm serious.

16:47.546 --> 16:49.480
I mean, it's an amazing
book that you've written,

16:49.514 --> 16:51.311
and I'm curious that-
"Oh, that guy had a"-

16:51.349 --> 16:52.543
"Remember that guy
we did Maher with?"

16:52.584 --> 16:53.608
"Oh, he's dead."
"What happened?"

16:53.652 --> 16:54.846
"He had an
accident." I mean...

16:54.886 --> 16:56.012
And here are the-

16:58.056 --> 17:01.025
Residents are being
picked up, abducted...

17:01.059 --> 17:02.616
Congress wasn't going
to investigate

17:02.660 --> 17:04.388
the raid in Gardez.

17:04.428 --> 17:05.952
And my Freedom of
Information requests

17:05.996 --> 17:07.588
were bounced all
over the military,

17:07.631 --> 17:10.761
ending up in an unnamed
agency awaiting review.

17:13.137 --> 17:15.071
I reached out to everyone
I could in Washington-

17:15.107 --> 17:17.871
the CIA, State Department,

17:17.909 --> 17:19.809
former military officials-

17:19.845 --> 17:22.405
but no one would speak
openly about Gardez...

17:23.682 --> 17:25.444
Until I met with
General Hugh Shelton,

17:25.483 --> 17:28.419
Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs on 9/11.

17:28.464 --> 17:31.427
GEN. HUGH SHELTON
CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF

17:32.124 --> 17:34.092
One incident that I looked
into in Afghanistan,

17:34.126 --> 17:35.559
where an Afghan police commander

17:35.594 --> 17:37.221
and two pregnant
women were killed-

17:37.262 --> 17:38.752
but the question I
wanted to ask you is,

17:38.797 --> 17:40.560
in that kind of case-
let's say that's true-

17:40.599 --> 17:42.157
how would something
like that be handled

17:42.200 --> 17:43.963
or investigated or reviewed?

17:44.002 --> 17:45.765
If they go flying in

17:45.804 --> 17:47.669
and meet any kind of
resistance at all-

17:47.706 --> 17:49.434
I mean, shots are fired-

17:49.473 --> 17:51.441
then I'm sorry if
they got killed,

17:51.475 --> 17:53.466
but they're in the wrong
place at the wrong time,

17:53.511 --> 17:55.308
and I don't think it ought
to be investigated.

17:55.346 --> 17:56.472
I think you write it off

17:56.514 --> 17:59.508
as one of those
damn acts of war.

17:59.552 --> 18:01.781
But one of the victims was
a senior police commander

18:01.820 --> 18:03.412
who had been trained
by the U.S.

18:03.455 --> 18:04.888
And two of them were
pregnant women.

18:04.923 --> 18:06.550
Now, just 'cause
he's a police chief-

18:06.591 --> 18:08.525
he could've been a
terrorist as well.

18:08.560 --> 18:10.425
You know, he could've
been working both sides,

18:10.462 --> 18:13.488
so that piece of it,
although it sounds bad-

18:13.532 --> 18:15.830
but two pregnant women?

18:15.867 --> 18:19.598
The fact that they were pregnant
is very, very unfortunate,

18:19.638 --> 18:21.765
but it's also unfortunate
that they were women.

18:21.807 --> 18:23.604
But on the other hand,

18:23.642 --> 18:26.873
I've been shot at
by women myself,

18:26.912 --> 18:28.209
so that doesn't-

18:28.246 --> 18:29.611
And I mean shot at.

18:29.648 --> 18:31.946
That doesn't excuse 'em.

18:31.983 --> 18:35.146
They die just like men do
if they shoot at us, so...

18:41.892 --> 18:43.883
Congress wasn't interested.

18:43.928 --> 18:45.897
I was being stonewalled
by the military.

18:45.931 --> 18:47.057
And General Shelton told me

18:47.098 --> 18:49.089
there should be
no investigation.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.140
KAIA AIRPORT
KABUL, AFGHANISTAN

18:52.170 --> 18:53.797
And back in Afghanistan,

18:53.839 --> 18:55.932
the reporter who first
broke the Gardez story

18:55.974 --> 18:57.942
had been publicly
attacked by NATO.

18:59.509 --> 19:01.483
JEROME STARKEY
TIMES OF LONDON

19:01.513 --> 19:03.504
Yeah, we went to
print on a Saturday.

19:06.885 --> 19:08.352
By Saturday afternoon,

19:08.386 --> 19:09.648
I was getting information

19:09.688 --> 19:11.679
from other journalists in
Kabul who are my friends

19:11.723 --> 19:13.350
that NATO was
briefing against me.

19:13.391 --> 19:15.018
NATO was trying to discredit me,

19:15.060 --> 19:16.857
trying to say that the
story was inaccurate,

19:16.895 --> 19:18.829
and effectively trying
to kill it dead.

19:19.965 --> 19:22.058
To my knowledge, that
was the only time

19:22.100 --> 19:23.589
that they've named a journalist

19:23.634 --> 19:27.126
and sort of singled out a
journalist so specifically

19:27.171 --> 19:28.638
in a denial.

19:28.672 --> 19:31.072
NATO accused Starkey of lying.

19:31.108 --> 19:33.873
It could have been enough to
end a journalist's career.

19:33.912 --> 19:37.508
But information about
Gardez kept leaking out.

19:37.550 --> 19:39.517
A secret UN
investigation confirmed

19:39.551 --> 19:42.019
many of the details the
family had told us,

19:42.053 --> 19:44.419
and an Afghan police
inquiry was under way.

19:45.185 --> 19:47.146
MOHAMMED DAOUD

19:54.232 --> 19:56.860
I didn't realize what the
family was showing me.

19:56.902 --> 19:58.426
It was just a grainy
cell phone video

19:58.470 --> 19:59.903
from the morning
after the attack...

19:59.938 --> 20:01.098
[indistinct conversation]

20:01.139 --> 20:02.504
Until the voices began.

20:02.619 --> 20:04.690
<i>Ok, the blood trail, this is it.
This is the last room.</i>

20:04.691 --> 20:06.299
<i>This is where the engagement was.</i>

20:06.300 --> 20:08.900
<i>If he comes in here,
there's a woman crying in the doorway.</i>

20:08.901 --> 20:12.350
<i>My group was emptying this room
and that room there, okay?</i>

20:12.900 --> 20:15.040
<i>We pulled everyone out, okay?</i>

20:15.800 --> 20:18.700
<i>Now, at that point, I'm watching
what's going on here.</i>

20:18.800 --> 20:21.350
<i>I see it all go down,
and now we go behind them.</i>

20:21.351 --> 20:23.800
<i>White light.
To make sure no one's hiding.</i>

20:23.801 --> 20:24.728
<i>When I get to here...</i>

20:24.729 --> 20:25.890
Two Americans,

20:25.932 --> 20:27.489
their hands visible for a moment

20:27.532 --> 20:28.897
filming the corpses

20:28.934 --> 20:30.492
while they piece
together their version

20:30.535 --> 20:31.695
of that night's killings.

20:32.460 --> 20:35.850
<i>After everything's said and
done, still two guys are hiding...</i>

20:36.441 --> 20:38.204
NATO phoned me up,
and they said,

20:38.243 --> 20:40.006
"Jerome, we're just
calling to let you know

20:40.045 --> 20:41.910
"we're about to put
out a press release.

20:41.947 --> 20:44.279
We are changing our
version of events."

20:44.316 --> 20:47.285
They admitted that
they were responsible

20:47.319 --> 20:50.720
for killing the three women

20:50.755 --> 20:53.383
and that the men they
said were Taliban

20:53.425 --> 20:55.256
were not, in fact, Taliban.

20:55.293 --> 20:56.384
They admitted they'd
got it wrong.

20:56.427 --> 20:58.156
Again, they were hoping
it was gonna go away.

20:58.195 --> 20:59.321
Well, it wasn't.

20:59.363 --> 21:01.558
Like yourselves, we set off
very early one morning

21:01.598 --> 21:03.759
from Kabul through
Logar to Gardez...

21:04.902 --> 21:07.531
When up rolls a huge convoy

21:07.572 --> 21:10.973
of countless Afghan
officers and soldiers.

21:11.009 --> 21:12.135
And among them is a man

21:12.177 --> 21:13.804
wearing a uniform
that I recognize

21:13.845 --> 21:15.005
as sort of U.S. Marines,

21:15.046 --> 21:16.809
but it says U.S.
Navy on his lapel.

21:16.848 --> 21:18.042
But I didn't know who he was.

21:18.083 --> 21:20.313
They off-loaded a sheep,

21:20.352 --> 21:22.479
and three Afghan soldiers
knelt on this sheep

21:22.520 --> 21:23.919
in exactly the same place

21:23.955 --> 21:26.947
where these soldiers had been
when they started the raid.

21:26.992 --> 21:29.017
They were offering to
sacrifice the sheep.

21:29.060 --> 21:31.585
The soldiers tried to stop
Starkey's photographer,

21:31.629 --> 21:32.926
Jeremy Kelly,

21:32.964 --> 21:35.592
but the family insisted.

21:35.633 --> 21:37.066
Otherwise, there'd
be no evidence

21:37.102 --> 21:39.696
that this extraordinary
event occurred,

21:39.738 --> 21:42.206
no proof of who
the killers were.

21:42.240 --> 21:44.173
Like so much about this war,

21:44.208 --> 21:46.176
they would have remained unseen.

21:46.210 --> 21:49.008
He said that, "My
soldiers were responsible

21:49.046 --> 21:52.072
for the deaths of these
members of your family,"

21:52.116 --> 21:53.447
and for that, he apologized.

21:54.273 --> 22:02.042
I would not trade my sons for the
entire kingdom of the United States.

22:02.072 --> 22:06.213
America unleashes
the Special Forces on us.

22:06.243 --> 22:09.216
And the Special Forces
beat and kill poor, innocent people.

22:09.246 --> 22:15.711
These Special Forces with the
beards did cruel, criminal things.

22:15.877 --> 22:17.838
They all have beards.

22:19.172 --> 22:21.508
We call them
the American Taliban.

22:59.046 --> 23:01.006
BROOKLYN, NY

23:03.955 --> 23:05.252
I returned home

23:05.290 --> 23:08.282
and tried to put the story
of Gardez behind me.

23:08.326 --> 23:09.918
But coming home is never easy.

23:14.732 --> 23:15.926
I didn't want to admit it,

23:15.967 --> 23:17.524
but life back home was dull

23:17.568 --> 23:18.933
after being in a war zone.

23:21.138 --> 23:22.799
Ordinary life was just that.

23:31.249 --> 23:33.012
I tried to forget about Gardez

23:33.051 --> 23:34.109
but couldn't.

23:34.152 --> 23:36.313
We pulled everyone out, okay?

23:37.255 --> 23:38.722
Now, at that point,

23:38.756 --> 23:40.485
I'm watching what's
going on here.

23:40.525 --> 23:41.958
I see it all go down. Now...

23:41.993 --> 23:44.461
The video was chilling,

23:44.496 --> 23:46.487
but I couldn't see their faces.

23:46.531 --> 23:49.557
All I had were images
of their hands

23:49.601 --> 23:50.932
and the sound of their voices.

23:50.969 --> 23:52.368
Okay, the blood trail.
This is it.

23:52.403 --> 23:53.529
This is the last room.

23:53.571 --> 23:54.902
This is where the
engagement was.

23:54.939 --> 23:56.372
He comes in here. There's-

23:56.407 --> 23:58.034
There's a woman crying
in the doorway.

23:58.076 --> 24:01.307
None of these clues
were supposed to exist-

24:01.346 --> 24:02.711
the cell phone video,

24:02.747 --> 24:04.737
the photos of the
admiral and his sheep.

24:06.150 --> 24:08.618
The killers were meant to
disappear without a trace.

24:11.288 --> 24:14.189
The family had called
them "American Taliban."

24:14.224 --> 24:15.486
But who were they,

24:15.526 --> 24:17.927
these American
soldiers with beards?

24:28.173 --> 24:29.765
As a reporter, you
learn that every story

24:29.807 --> 24:31.799
has conflicting points of view.

24:33.011 --> 24:34.569
You try to understand
all of them

24:34.612 --> 24:36.273
without letting your
own get in the way.

24:38.383 --> 24:40.578
But there was something
about this story

24:40.618 --> 24:42.108
and the way it was covered up.

24:44.322 --> 24:46.153
The photo of the admiral
had seemed to answer

24:46.191 --> 24:47.681
our questions about the raid.

24:49.360 --> 24:50.826
But the longer I looked at it,

24:50.861 --> 24:53.125
the less sense it made.

24:53.163 --> 24:55.154
I could read the name and rank,

24:55.199 --> 24:57.497
but who was this man
delivering the sheep?

24:59.670 --> 25:01.001
Vice Admiral William McRaven

25:01.038 --> 25:03.472
wasn't from NATO
Headquarters in Kabul,

25:03.507 --> 25:05.567
and he wasn't from the
Eastern Regional Command

25:05.610 --> 25:07.009
that owned that battle space.

25:08.413 --> 25:11.541
I'd never seen the R01
insignia on his shoulder.

25:11.583 --> 25:14.074
And it was hard to find
mention of him in the press,

25:14.118 --> 25:15.608
much less a photograph.

25:17.021 --> 25:20.354
But I found an old DoD
press briefing from 2008

25:20.391 --> 25:22.086
that mentioned
McRaven's nomination

25:22.126 --> 25:24.026
to lead an obscure unit
within the military

25:24.062 --> 25:26.189
called JSOC,

25:26.231 --> 25:28.392
the Joint Special
Operations Command.

25:31.035 --> 25:33.299
After more than a decade
as a war reporter,

25:33.338 --> 25:36.205
I thought I knew most of
the players involved,

25:36.241 --> 25:37.867
but I'd never heard of JSOC.

25:39.576 --> 25:41.544
There was little
official record,

25:41.578 --> 25:43.671
but JSOC was formed in 1980

25:43.714 --> 25:46.148
after the failed hostage
rescue mission in Iran.

25:47.150 --> 25:48.242
It was designed

25:48.285 --> 25:50.583
as the most covert
unit in the military

25:50.621 --> 25:53.147
and the only one that reports
directly to the White House.

25:55.593 --> 25:57.584
So why would the
President's elite force

25:57.629 --> 26:00.393
be kicking down the doors
on a family in Gardez?

26:02.233 --> 26:04.667
I knew Gardez wasn't
an isolated incident

26:04.702 --> 26:07.432
and went back to NATO's
daily press releases

26:07.472 --> 26:09.463
with their lists of
killed and captured.

26:11.442 --> 26:14.240
I expected the list to be long,

26:14.279 --> 26:16.179
but I had no idea how long.

26:17.949 --> 26:20.417
Every week, the tempo
of raids increased.

26:20.451 --> 26:21.850
In the last three months,

26:21.886 --> 26:24.649
there had been 1, 700 night
raids in Afghanistan.

26:25.956 --> 26:28.083
It was a staggering figure

26:28.125 --> 26:29.752
and meant that stories
like the one in Gardez

26:29.793 --> 26:32.489
were unfolding nearly
20 times each night.

26:33.864 --> 26:36.492
An endless list of raids

26:36.533 --> 26:38.000
but not a single name.

26:40.672 --> 26:43.470
I could see that Gardez was
part of a bigger story-

26:43.508 --> 26:44.873
much bigger.

26:44.909 --> 26:46.809
But the very thought of
it was overwhelming.

26:48.246 --> 26:50.544
With 1, 700 raids,

26:50.581 --> 26:52.242
who would compile the
list of the dead?

27:05.229 --> 27:06.526
The surge of night raids

27:06.564 --> 27:08.896
was clearly changing the
war in Afghanistan.

27:11.302 --> 27:14.634
It didn't take long for
JSOC's actions to ricochet.

27:14.671 --> 27:17.139
Matthew Hoh has become
the first U.S. official

27:17.174 --> 27:20.837
to resign in protest
over the Afghan war.

27:20.877 --> 27:22.708
Hoh is a former marine
who spent five months

27:22.746 --> 27:24.941
working for the State
Department in Afghanistan

27:24.981 --> 27:27.382
and is, by all accounts,
well-respected.

27:30.859 --> 27:32.927
CPT. MATTHEW HOH
FORMER STATE DEPT. OFFICIAL

27:32.957 --> 27:34.015
A lot of times, yeah,

27:34.058 --> 27:35.491
the right guys would
get targeted,

27:35.526 --> 27:37.153
and the right guys
would get killed.

27:37.195 --> 27:38.492
And then plenty of other times,

27:38.529 --> 27:39.894
the wrong people
would get killed,

27:39.931 --> 27:41.660
sometimes innocent families.

27:41.699 --> 27:44.167
And then that sets
you back so far.

27:44.202 --> 27:46.170
You know, nothing like
going into a village

27:46.204 --> 27:48.171
in the middle of the night,
knocking a door down,

27:48.205 --> 27:50.106
and, like, killing
a woman or a child

27:50.141 --> 27:53.838
to just undo everything that
infantry battalion command

27:53.878 --> 27:56.472
had been trying to do for, like,
the last nine, ten months.

27:56.514 --> 27:57.538
You were in a position

27:57.582 --> 27:59.640
where you were
trying to vet lists

27:59.683 --> 28:01.651
to make sure that
the wrong people

28:01.685 --> 28:03.482
weren't being killed
by these task forces.

28:03.520 --> 28:06.080
Were there 500 people
on this list, 1,000?

28:06.123 --> 28:07.454
No, I can't-
I can't tell you.

28:07.491 --> 28:08.583
- Oh, you can't?
- Yeah.

28:08.625 --> 28:10.149
You can't tell me because...

28:10.193 --> 28:11.888
I can't tell you 'cause I
can't tell you that stuff.

28:11.928 --> 28:12.986
- You can't talk about it?
- Yeah.

28:13.029 --> 28:14.054
I saw the list. I saw
how big they are.

28:14.098 --> 28:15.258
Yeah, everything else, yeah.

28:15.299 --> 28:16.891
I mean, that's-
I can't tell you.

28:16.934 --> 28:18.094
I was just...

28:26.477 --> 28:28.104
The Joint Special
Operations Command

28:28.146 --> 28:30.239
had never numbered more
than a few thousand.

28:31.582 --> 28:33.106
But under William McRaven,

28:33.151 --> 28:35.585
Afghanistan had
become JSOC's war.

28:36.788 --> 28:38.756
How had such a small covert unit

28:38.790 --> 28:40.485
taken over the largest
conventional war

28:40.525 --> 28:41.583
on the planet?

28:43.961 --> 28:46.588
Andrew Exum had experienced
the change firsthand

28:46.630 --> 28:47.927
when he served as part

28:47.964 --> 28:50.398
of McRaven's high value
targeting campaign,

28:50.434 --> 28:52.095
not in Afghanistan

28:52.135 --> 28:53.830
but in Iraq.

28:53.870 --> 28:56.236
He led a company
of rangers in 2003

28:56.273 --> 28:59.037
as part of JSOC's
Iraq task force.

28:59.364 --> 29:01.825
CPT. ANDREW EXUM
75TH RANGER REGIMENT

29:02.180 --> 29:05.081
I watched the way
things began to change.

29:05.116 --> 29:07.516
You know, kind of
the iron rule was,

29:07.552 --> 29:09.645
you don't go anywhere unless
you've got, you know,

29:09.687 --> 29:12.121
a company of Army
Rangers in reserve.

29:12.156 --> 29:15.683
In 2003, nobody was in reserve.

29:15.726 --> 29:18.194
I mean, people were hitting
targets every single night

29:18.229 --> 29:20.026
in a very dispersed way

29:20.064 --> 29:21.895
and just-bam, bam, bam.

29:21.933 --> 29:23.958
I mean, you remember
the deck of cards.

29:24.001 --> 29:26.264
We kind of had this
poster of all these guys,

29:26.303 --> 29:29.137
and we went out looking
for them every night.

29:29.173 --> 29:30.697
So we would, you know,
kick down a door

29:30.741 --> 29:32.140
and pull somebody
out of their home

29:32.175 --> 29:33.267
in the middle of the night,

29:33.310 --> 29:34.777
and the next morning, you know,

29:34.811 --> 29:36.642
people would be rioting
in the streets.

29:37.881 --> 29:39.246
I'm in!

29:39.282 --> 29:40.306
Clear!

29:40.350 --> 29:41.977
Come out!

29:42.018 --> 29:43.883
On your fuckin' face.

29:43.920 --> 29:45.785
On your face.

29:49.827 --> 29:51.988
Yeah, I remember one
night going out.

29:52.029 --> 29:53.223
You know, we found out later

29:53.264 --> 29:55.732
that we were on
two-weeks-old intelligence.

29:55.766 --> 29:57.597
Two Iraqis started
shooting at us.

29:57.635 --> 29:58.966
We killed them.

29:59.003 --> 30:00.971
And, you know, we kind
of realized later

30:01.005 --> 30:03.098
that these guys were
just out guarding the-

30:03.140 --> 30:04.903
you know, the
neighborhood generator.

30:04.942 --> 30:06.603
Now, I didn't lose
any sleep over it,

30:06.644 --> 30:07.941
'cause these guys
were shooting at me,

30:07.979 --> 30:09.344
but, you know, you start
thinking about it

30:09.380 --> 30:11.848
from a strategic
perspective- that's a loss.

30:11.883 --> 30:13.908
You start out with
a target list,

30:13.951 --> 30:15.577
and maybe you got 50 guys on it;

30:15.619 --> 30:17.281
maybe you got 200 guys on it.

30:17.321 --> 30:21.222
But you can work your way
through those 50 or 200 guys,

30:21.258 --> 30:22.748
and then suddenly,

30:22.792 --> 30:24.089
at the end of that target list,

30:24.127 --> 30:25.458
you've now got a new target list

30:25.495 --> 30:27.861
of, you know, 3,000
people on it.

30:27.898 --> 30:29.593
And how did this grow?

30:33.570 --> 30:37.200
What Exum told me about
Iraq was a revelation.

30:37.241 --> 30:39.300
I thought JSOC's rise
had happened later

30:39.343 --> 30:41.470
in Afghanistan.

30:41.512 --> 30:43.571
I'd worked in Baghdad for years

30:43.614 --> 30:45.548
and had written countless
stories there,

30:45.583 --> 30:47.414
many from the front
lines of the war.

30:48.753 --> 30:50.414
It was there that I
first started reporting

30:50.454 --> 30:51.751
for The Nation magazine.

30:53.190 --> 30:54.817
But I'd never heard of JSOC.

30:54.859 --> 30:57.054
The budget for the Joint
Special Operations Command,

30:57.094 --> 30:58.618
you can't get it through
a FOIA request.

30:58.663 --> 30:59.925
We've tried that.

30:59.964 --> 31:02.364
I'd missed the most
important story.

31:02.400 --> 31:04.367
In Iraq, the U.S. had
fundamentally changed

31:04.401 --> 31:05.767
the way it fought war.

31:07.270 --> 31:09.101
The real story, JSOC,

31:09.139 --> 31:10.936
was hidden in the shadows,

31:10.974 --> 31:12.032
out of sight.

31:15.745 --> 31:17.372
What was hidden in the
shadows right now?

31:17.414 --> 31:18.847
...That I propose

31:18.882 --> 31:21.942
represent a new direction
from the last eight years.

31:23.220 --> 31:24.687
What was I missing today?

31:24.722 --> 31:28.283
We are embracing more
oversight of our actions,

31:28.326 --> 31:31.489
and we're narrowing our use of
the state secrets privilege.

31:32.930 --> 31:34.864
I discovered that,
over the past decade,

31:34.899 --> 31:36.924
a series of secret
presidential orders

31:36.968 --> 31:39.459
had given JSOC
unprecedented authority.

31:40.638 --> 31:42.606
The battlefield was expanded,

31:42.640 --> 31:44.267
and JSOC could now hit at will

31:44.308 --> 31:46.799
in countries beyond
Iraq and Afghanistan.

31:54.517 --> 31:56.917
I began to research
strikes against al-Qaeda

31:56.953 --> 31:58.784
outside the declared
battlefields.

32:00.323 --> 32:02.314
I looked for patterns
among the lists.

32:03.660 --> 32:04.786
And then I found one.

32:06.096 --> 32:08.223
In December 2009,

32:08.264 --> 32:11.029
five strikes with
over 150 casualties

32:11.068 --> 32:13.059
in a country without
a declared war.

32:16.941 --> 32:19.910
[Man singing in native language]

32:29.365 --> 32:31.618
ADEN, YEMEN

32:34.125 --> 32:35.251
Aden.

32:35.292 --> 32:36.919
Yemen's ancient port city

32:36.961 --> 32:38.952
was nothing like Kabul.

32:38.996 --> 32:42.395
In Afghanistan, life was
defined by the war.

32:42.431 --> 32:44.593
Everything revolved around it.

32:44.634 --> 32:46.602
But in Yemen, there was no war,

32:46.636 --> 32:47.796
at least not officially.

32:51.274 --> 32:53.469
The strikes seemed to have
come out of the blue,

32:53.510 --> 32:56.138
and most Yemenis were going
about life as usual.

33:00.985 --> 33:03.783
It was difficult to
know where to start.

33:03.821 --> 33:06.654
The Yemeni government claimed
responsibility for the strikes,

33:06.691 --> 33:09.956
saying they'd killed dozens
of al-Qaeda operatives.

33:09.994 --> 33:12.792
But it was unclear who
the targets really were

33:12.830 --> 33:14.457
or who was even responsible.

33:17.635 --> 33:19.262
I arranged to meet the
most powerful man

33:19.303 --> 33:20.930
in southern Yemen,

33:20.971 --> 33:22.836
Sheikh Saleh Bin Fareed.

33:22.961 --> 33:24.780
SHEIKH SALEH BIN FAREED
LEADER, AL-AULAQ TRIBE

33:24.942 --> 33:27.239
When was the first time
that you heard about

33:27.277 --> 33:29.177
someone being al-Qaeda
in that area?

33:29.377 --> 33:34.650
It is, eh... I never knew
that anybody belonged to al-Qaeda,

33:34.950 --> 33:39.000
except in the last three years.

33:39.200 --> 33:44.000
Especially after the Americans
attacked Al-majalah.

33:49.033 --> 33:52.161
How did you first
hear of the strikes

33:52.203 --> 33:54.671
that had happened
on December 17th?

33:54.871 --> 33:58.550
We got telephones from...
from those people

33:58.750 --> 34:01.300
and of course the news word
on Al Jazeera.

34:01.378 --> 34:02.504
What was the news saying?

34:02.600 --> 34:05.100
Our government attacked
al-Qaeda base

34:05.101 --> 34:09.449
in Al-majalah where al-Qaeda
have a field for training

34:09.650 --> 34:13.250
and they have huge stores
for all kinds of weapons

34:13.251 --> 34:15.550
and missiles and rockets and...

34:16.600 --> 34:18.900
and they did not mention
the Americans at all.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
When we went there,
we saw what happened

34:31.600 --> 34:34.800
I mean, I mean, if somebody
has got a weak heart,

34:34.801 --> 34:36.100
he will collapse.

34:36.101 --> 34:40.000
You see goats and
sheeps all over.

34:40.400 --> 34:45.199
See the heads of those who
were killed here and there.

34:45.201 --> 34:47.000
You see children.

34:47.300 --> 34:51.000
And you cannot tell
this meat belongs to

34:51.001 --> 34:54.000
animals or to
human beings.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Why did they do this?
Why did they had to do this?

34:57.500 --> 35:00.500
There is no stores,
there is no field for training,

35:00.700 --> 35:04.000
there is nobody,
except a very poor tribe,

35:05.300 --> 35:10.500
one of the poorest
tribes in the south.

35:23.456 --> 35:25.833
AL MAJALAH
ABYAN PROVINCE

35:27.668 --> 35:30.922
People saw the smoke
and felt the earth shake.

35:31.089 --> 35:35.605
They had never
seen anything like it.

35:35.635 --> 35:41.099
Iran to the area.
I found scattered bodies

35:41.265 --> 35:45.615
and injured women and children.

35:45.645 --> 35:51.037
46 people were killed,
including 5 pregnant women.

35:51.067 --> 35:53.289
If they kill innocent children
and call them al Qaeda,

35:53.319 --> 35:55.530
then we are all al Qaeda.

35:55.696 --> 36:00.159
If children are terrorists,
then we are all terrorists.

36:14.215 --> 36:22.056
At 6 am they were sleeping
and I was making bread.

36:22.265 --> 36:31.023
When the missiles exploded,
I lost consciousness.

36:31.190 --> 36:34.819
I didn't know what happened to my
children, my daughter, my husband.

36:35.444 --> 36:36.696
They all died.

36:36.863 --> 36:42.493
Only I survived, along with this
old man and my daughter.

36:43.661 --> 36:46.164
Missiles attacked me.

36:47.540 --> 36:49.500
And my brother Ibrahim.

36:49.667 --> 36:51.127
And my mother.

36:51.878 --> 36:53.629
Their hands were cut.

36:59.924 --> 37:02.757
The echoes of Gardez
were everywhere...

37:02.793 --> 37:05.284
So many of the details
repeating themselves.

37:09.133 --> 37:10.794
But there was one
important difference.

37:11.969 --> 37:13.596
In Gardez, the American soldiers

37:13.637 --> 37:16.037
went to obscene lengths
to cover up the killings.

37:17.241 --> 37:18.367
Here in al-Majalah,

37:18.409 --> 37:20.274
despite the official denial,

37:20.311 --> 37:23.074
they'd left their fingerprints
strewn across the desert.

37:25.281 --> 37:27.579
Why would they deny
something so obvious

37:27.617 --> 37:29.107
when anyone who
visited the bomb site

37:29.152 --> 37:30.585
would see the truth?

37:33.923 --> 37:35.515
But maybe that was the point.

37:35.558 --> 37:38.424
There was no declared
war in Yemen.

37:38.460 --> 37:40.486
Out here, in the
middle of the desert,

37:40.530 --> 37:42.829
no one was looking.

37:42.866 --> 37:44.959
And the one local reporter
investigating the bombing

37:45.002 --> 37:46.367
had disappeared.

37:47.558 --> 37:52.450
The decision to arrest me was
made the day I exposed the cover-up

37:52.480 --> 37:57.038
of the murder of women
and children in Abyan.

37:57.068 --> 38:01.489
The day I exposed those who sent
cruise missiles to bedouin camps.

38:02.281 --> 38:04.091
ABDULELAH HAIDER SHAYE
YEMENI JOURNALIST

38:04.121 --> 38:06.589
Abdulelah Haider Shaye had
traveled to al-Majalah

38:06.623 --> 38:08.590
immediately after the strike,

38:08.624 --> 38:11.923
and his reporting sparked
national outrage.

38:11.961 --> 38:13.929
Soon after, his house was raided

38:13.963 --> 38:17.160
by Yemen's American-trained
counterterrorism forces.

38:17.200 --> 38:19.100
Abdulelah was thrown in prison.

38:19.135 --> 38:21.126
Posters demanding his return

38:21.170 --> 38:22.501
were hung around the capital.

38:26.534 --> 38:28.562
ABDULRAH MAN BARMAN
ABDULELAH'S LAWYER

38:28.678 --> 38:30.806
I met Abdulelah's
lawyer at a teahouse

38:30.848 --> 38:32.615
because his office
was under attack.

38:32.645 --> 38:37.274
They fired over 120
shells into my office.

38:37.304 --> 38:40.039
And now we can't reach it

38:40.069 --> 38:42.488
because the Republican Guard
are deployed in the area.

38:47.994 --> 38:56.514
In court, I noticed that one of
Abdulelah's teeth had been pulled.

38:56.544 --> 38:58.253
And another
had been broken.

38:58.283 --> 39:01.215
And he had
scars on his chest.

39:01.911 --> 39:04.379
My understanding was that
President Ali Abdullah Saleh

39:04.414 --> 39:07.076
was going to pardon
Abdulelah Haider.

39:07.106 --> 39:10.027
The president
agreed to release him.

39:10.057 --> 39:14.020
But that same day, the
president got a call from Obama

39:14.186 --> 39:19.817
expressing concern
about Abdulelah's release.

39:21.565 --> 39:24.432
I'd heard the story
many times in Yemen-

39:24.468 --> 39:26.095
President Obama
personally intervening

39:26.136 --> 39:28.502
to keep a respected Yemeni
journalist in prison.

39:29.940 --> 39:31.430
It sounded farfetched to me.

39:32.943 --> 39:34.137
But then I found this

39:34.178 --> 39:36.806
on the White House's
own website,

39:36.847 --> 39:38.109
a readout from a phone call

39:38.148 --> 39:41.015
between Obama and the
Yemeni president.

39:41.051 --> 39:43.280
They badly misspelled
Abdulelah's name,

39:43.319 --> 39:45.787
but Obama's point was clear.

39:45.822 --> 39:48.086
He wanted him kept in jail.

39:52.895 --> 39:55.022
Al-Majalah was the
first reported strike

39:55.064 --> 39:56.759
inside Yemen in seven years.

39:59.235 --> 40:00.827
It was clearly a U.S.
Cruise missile

40:00.870 --> 40:02.701
that struck the Bedouin camp.

40:04.073 --> 40:06.304
Since there was no
declared war in Yemen,

40:06.343 --> 40:08.868
I knew the strike was
either JSOC or the CIA.

40:12.082 --> 40:13.447
And then I found this photo.

40:15.953 --> 40:17.887
The U.S. would have
never released it,

40:17.921 --> 40:21.379
but Yemen's president posted
it on his personal website-

40:21.425 --> 40:25.054
a presidential meeting with
an important American guest,

40:25.095 --> 40:27.757
the head of the Joint
Special Operations Command,

40:27.798 --> 40:30.288
Admiral William McRaven.

41:00.898 --> 41:02.525
Joining us now is
Jeremy Scahill,

41:02.566 --> 41:05.034
national security correspondent
for The Nation magazine.

41:05.068 --> 41:06.330
His latest article is all about

41:06.370 --> 41:07.735
the U.S. relationship
with Yemen.

41:07.771 --> 41:09.068
Jeremy, thank you
for joining us.

41:09.106 --> 41:10.095
Thank you.

41:10.140 --> 41:11.334
Back in New York,

41:11.375 --> 41:13.343
I started writing
stories about JSOC,

41:13.377 --> 41:15.844
their rise to lead
force in Afghanistan,

41:15.878 --> 41:18.005
their covert strikes in Yemen,

41:18.047 --> 41:19.139
and it felt as though

41:19.182 --> 41:20.672
I had crossed an
invisible tripwire.

41:20.716 --> 41:21.978
The reality is that

41:22.018 --> 41:24.578
U.S. counterterrorism
obsession with Yemen

41:24.620 --> 41:26.019
trumped concern
for human rights.

41:26.055 --> 41:27.750
- That's not true.
- And it's-

41:27.790 --> 41:29.690
Well, it is true.
- It's not true.

41:29.725 --> 41:30.885
Yup, back there.

41:30.927 --> 41:32.360
Does the Pentagon
have any comment

41:32.395 --> 41:34.886
on a report in The Nation today?

41:34.931 --> 41:35.955
And my question is-

41:35.998 --> 41:37.022
- Yeah, I guess- I-I-

41:37.066 --> 41:38.192
- The question is-

41:38.234 --> 41:40.567
you keep denying
covert operations.

41:40.604 --> 41:42.366
Isn't this yet more
evidence of one?

41:42.405 --> 41:43.565
Okay.

41:43.606 --> 41:46.235
Despite whatever
conspiratorial theories

41:46.276 --> 41:49.404
that, you know, magazines
or broadcast outlets

41:49.446 --> 41:51.175
may want to cook up,

41:51.215 --> 41:52.842
there's nothing to it.

41:52.883 --> 41:54.214
So, Jeremy, let me ask you,

41:54.251 --> 41:58.017
have we been going into
all of these countries

41:58.055 --> 42:00.888
over the past decade
with drone attacks,

42:00.924 --> 42:04.552
dropping bombs in countries
where we haven't declared war?

42:04.594 --> 42:06.425
The lack of response
from the major media

42:06.462 --> 42:08.293
and the CIA and all
the rest of it

42:08.331 --> 42:11.198
suggests they're dismissing
what you've done.

42:11.234 --> 42:12.997
I receive a call, unprompted,

42:13.035 --> 42:15.970
from a Captain James Kirby,

42:16.005 --> 42:17.905
who is the spokesperson
for Admiral Mike Mullen.

42:17.940 --> 42:19.407
Calls me on my cell phone.

42:19.442 --> 42:21.410
Wouldn't tell me how he
got my cell phone number.

42:21.444 --> 42:23.412
Wouldn't tell me who told
him about the story.

42:23.446 --> 42:24.913
This is hours from publication.

42:24.947 --> 42:26.210
And told me that

42:26.250 --> 42:27.581
if we published this
story in The Nation

42:27.618 --> 42:29.210
that I would be "on thin ice."

42:29.253 --> 42:30.776
That was a direct quote.

42:30.820 --> 42:32.617
And I said, "Well,
I want to know

42:32.655 --> 42:33.953
"how you heard about this story,

42:33.991 --> 42:35.515
and I want to know how
you got my number."

42:35.559 --> 42:37.390
And he said, "Let's just say
that I heard about it."

42:41.798 --> 42:43.425
I wasn't sleeping well,

42:43.467 --> 42:45.526
and insomnia fueled my anxiety.

42:48.038 --> 42:49.766
My computer had been hacked

42:49.805 --> 42:51.568
and part of my
hard drive copied.

42:54.243 --> 42:57.235
It was difficult not to feel a
creeping sense of paranoia.

42:59.915 --> 43:01.815
And then I got another
strange phone call.

43:05.521 --> 43:07.455
I had no idea why he called me

43:07.490 --> 43:10.288
or how he got my number.

43:10.326 --> 43:12.521
I thought it might be a setup.

43:12.561 --> 43:13.688
Every story I worked on

43:13.730 --> 43:15.789
seemed to trace back to JSOC.

43:15.832 --> 43:17.561
And now, out of the blue,

43:17.601 --> 43:19.932
someone from the inside
was reaching out to me.

43:23.774 --> 43:25.264
I had met operators before

43:25.309 --> 43:27.072
in my research on Blackwater

43:27.110 --> 43:28.577
but no one as close to the heart

43:28.612 --> 43:30.443
of JSOC's covert operations.

43:31.948 --> 43:34.508
He sent me photos
of his DoD badges.

43:34.551 --> 43:36.848
But I still couldn't
help wondering,

43:36.886 --> 43:38.854
was I investigating JSOC,

43:38.888 --> 43:40.788
or were they investigating me?

43:54.837 --> 43:56.464
Explain what JSOC is.

43:57.900 --> 44:01.800
The Joint Special Operations Command
handles all of the sensitive

44:01.801 --> 44:07.100
counterterrorism missions as the US
government directs. And over time

44:07.200 --> 44:12.000
that was perverted into doing things
that are far outside of its mandate.

44:12.356 --> 44:14.517
What has JSOC been
doing in Yemen?

44:15.200 --> 44:19.000
Airstrikes...
Targeted killings.

44:19.463 --> 44:21.954
Targeted killings inside
the borders of Yemen?

44:22.000 --> 44:23.300
Correct.

44:23.500 --> 44:26.100
The world is a battlefield
and we are at war.

44:26.150 --> 44:29.700
Therefore the joint special operations
command can go wherever they please,

44:29.800 --> 44:34.400
and do whatever it is that they
want to do in order to achieve

44:34.600 --> 44:40.000
the national security objectives of whichever
administration happens to be in power.

44:40.049 --> 44:41.880
Were there ways that
JSOC was being used

44:41.917 --> 44:43.509
that you found objectionable?

44:44.500 --> 44:46.000
I did.

44:47.700 --> 44:53.000
There was...
a lot of trepidation about

44:53.001 --> 44:55.400
what we were being
asked to do, and where,

44:55.401 --> 44:57.500
and for what purpose.

45:00.000 --> 45:03.500
A lot of it was of
questionable legality,

45:04.000 --> 45:09.200
And most of it was outside
of any stated battlefield.

45:09.201 --> 45:12.000
Kinetic operations, whether
it's capture or kill,

45:12.200 --> 45:17.500
in some cases to detain people as directed
by the United States government.

45:17.700 --> 45:22.650
They launched their own
internalized interrogation program,

45:22.651 --> 45:26.700
without the knowledge of the
conventional U.S. military forces,

45:26.701 --> 45:29.100
or even the central
intelligence agency.

45:29.101 --> 45:32.100
Because of the extreme secrecy
surrounding the program,

45:32.101 --> 45:34.200
there was a variety of abuses.

45:34.837 --> 45:35.998
Torture?

45:38.350 --> 45:45.900
I would say that, yes. The president has
made a political and military calculation

45:46.100 --> 45:49.500
to let the Joint Special
Operations Command run wild.

45:49.700 --> 45:51.647
So you're saying JSOC
is able to hit harder

45:51.688 --> 45:52.814
under President Obama

45:52.856 --> 45:54.517
than they were under
President Bush?

45:54.717 --> 45:58.900
Harder, faster, quicker, with the
full support of the the white house.

46:12.107 --> 46:13.631
On my last day in Sana'a,

46:13.676 --> 46:15.871
a file had been left
for me at my hotel...

46:17.213 --> 46:20.046
A leaked investigation into
the strike of al-Majalah.

46:21.417 --> 46:23.045
It included a list of the dead.

46:28.925 --> 46:31.189
In Iraq, they had
a deck of cards,

46:31.228 --> 46:33.219
a list of 55 names.

46:34.830 --> 46:36.422
But the cards were not enough.

46:36.465 --> 46:37.932
New lists were needed.

46:37.967 --> 46:39.229
Longer lists.

46:39.268 --> 46:40.497
At the end of each list,

46:40.537 --> 46:42.801
another and another,

46:42.839 --> 46:44.430
an endless list of names.

46:53.516 --> 46:56.007
In al-Majalah, the
list numbered 46.

46:57.219 --> 46:59.653
14 of the names were women.

46:59.688 --> 47:02.179
21 were children.

47:02.224 --> 47:03.623
Who were they trying to kill?

47:06.362 --> 47:09.263
A week after al-Majalah,
there was another strike.

47:09.298 --> 47:10.823
And this time, the
Yemeni government

47:10.867 --> 47:13.665
issued a press release
naming the intended targets,

47:13.703 --> 47:16.137
but none of them
had been killed.

47:16.172 --> 47:19.073
For the first time, I had
names on the kill list

47:19.109 --> 47:21.703
of people who were still alive.

47:21.745 --> 47:23.939
Two of them were
publicly known leaders:

47:23.979 --> 47:25.776
Shihiri and Waheshi.

47:25.814 --> 47:28.305
But the last name
gave me a chill:

47:28.350 --> 47:30.114
Anwar al-Awlaki.

47:30.153 --> 47:31.585
I knew the name,

47:31.620 --> 47:33.520
but I couldn't believe
I was seeing it here

47:33.556 --> 47:35.786
on this list.

47:35.824 --> 47:37.815
Awlaki was an American citizen.

47:38.961 --> 47:40.553
The Christmas Day
bombing attempt

47:40.596 --> 47:42.496
has everybody on alert tonight.

47:42.531 --> 47:44.055
Investigators
connecting the dots,

47:44.099 --> 47:46.067
and a key focus in
the investigation

47:46.101 --> 47:47.568
is a radical Islamic cleric.

47:47.603 --> 47:49.400
That man is Anwar al-Awlaki,

47:49.438 --> 47:51.030
an exiled American who was...

47:51.073 --> 47:54.065
Just as I was investigating
the expanding war in Yemen,

47:54.109 --> 47:56.100
it seemed Awlaki's
name was everywhere.

47:57.447 --> 47:59.915
The War on Terror
suddenly had a new face.

47:59.950 --> 48:02.077
Radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki

48:02.118 --> 48:03.415
may now be as grave a threat

48:03.453 --> 48:05.580
as Osama bin Laden himself.

48:05.622 --> 48:07.385
Awlaki, Holder says,

48:07.424 --> 48:09.221
is a clear and present danger.

48:09.259 --> 48:11.591
He's an extremely dangerous man.

48:11.628 --> 48:12.992
Does the U.S.
have a preference

48:13.028 --> 48:14.791
in terms of al-Awlaki:

48:14.830 --> 48:16.730
Dead, captured, or prosecuted?

48:16.765 --> 48:18.665
Well, we certainly want
to neutralize him,

48:18.701 --> 48:22.660
and we will do whatever we
can in order to do that.

48:24.239 --> 48:25.900
An American was
on the kill list.

48:27.409 --> 48:29.570
It felt to me like we'd
walked off a cliff.

48:31.480 --> 48:32.947
Awlaki had been
sentenced to death

48:32.982 --> 48:34.813
without even being
charged with a crime.

48:38.220 --> 48:39.847
Awlaki's father filed a lawsuit

48:39.888 --> 48:42.083
with the help of the Center
for Constitutional Rights

48:42.124 --> 48:43.716
and the ACLU.

48:43.759 --> 48:45.352
He demanded that the
government provide

48:45.395 --> 48:48.125
whatever evidence they
had against his son.

48:48.164 --> 48:49.654
But the government refused.

48:49.699 --> 48:51.667
They had ordered
the assassination

48:51.701 --> 48:53.191
of a U.S. citizen

48:53.236 --> 48:55.136
but said the evidence
itself was too dangerous

48:55.171 --> 48:56.536
to be made public.

48:56.573 --> 48:59.872
What kind of protections
does this American have

48:59.909 --> 49:02.103
against being assassinated
by his own government?

49:02.144 --> 49:04.442
Yeah, it almost
sounds kind of funny

49:04.480 --> 49:06.606
in an ironic way
when you say that.

49:06.648 --> 49:09.618
You know, you have the right
not to be assassinated.

49:11.487 --> 49:13.011
A bill was introduced
in Congress

49:13.055 --> 49:16.422
to ban the extrajudicial
assassination of Americans,

49:16.458 --> 49:18.449
but only six
congressmen signed on.

49:19.962 --> 49:22.226
And the people who should have
known what was happening,

49:22.264 --> 49:24.357
the members of the
intelligence committees,

49:24.400 --> 49:25.560
couldn't tell me anything.

49:25.601 --> 49:27.091
When there is a lethal operation

49:27.136 --> 49:28.933
and a high-value
person is killed,

49:28.971 --> 49:31.132
the president, of course,
acknowledged that we killed-

49:31.173 --> 49:32.334
- He can't-
- Huh?

49:36.358 --> 49:38.685
SEN. RON WYDEN
SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE

49:38.982 --> 49:40.279
Has there been any legal review

49:40.316 --> 49:41.874
of the potential for
lethal operations

49:41.918 --> 49:43.476
against American citizens?

49:45.288 --> 49:47.119
- Not to our knowledge.
- Is that classified?

49:48.858 --> 49:52.917
It's important for the
American people to know

49:52.960 --> 49:56.260
when the President can
kill an American citizen

49:56.298 --> 49:58.061
and when they can't.

49:58.100 --> 50:03.367
And yet it is almost as if
there are two laws in America,

50:03.405 --> 50:05.703
and the American people

50:05.741 --> 50:08.835
would be extraordinarily
surprised

50:08.877 --> 50:11.072
if they could see the difference

50:11.113 --> 50:15.174
between what they
believe a law says

50:15.217 --> 50:19.017
and how it has actually
been interpreted in secret.

50:19.054 --> 50:20.352
You're not permitted

50:20.390 --> 50:22.255
to disclose that
difference publicly.

50:22.292 --> 50:23.384
That's correct.

50:42.844 --> 50:44.277
I wasn't surprised
when Washington

50:44.312 --> 50:45.746
ignored the killings in Gardez.

50:47.416 --> 50:50.214
But this was an
American citizen.

50:50.252 --> 50:52.652
The country was now
targeting one of its own.

50:54.590 --> 50:55.852
Even John Walker Lindh,

50:55.891 --> 50:57.381
who'd taken up arms
with the Taliban,

50:57.426 --> 50:58.552
was given a trial.

51:00.229 --> 51:02.197
What had Awlaki done?

51:02.231 --> 51:04.631
And why was the U.S. willing
to cross such a dangerous line

51:04.666 --> 51:05.997
to have him killed?

51:12.342 --> 51:15.470
I read everything I
could about Awlaki.

51:15.512 --> 51:18.140
It was obvious that he was an
immensely popular preacher

51:18.181 --> 51:19.443
with a large following

51:19.482 --> 51:21.040
among young
English-speaking Muslims

51:21.084 --> 51:22.176
around the world.

51:23.653 --> 51:25.120
On his blog, he openly praised

51:25.155 --> 51:27.452
some of the attacks
against the U.S.

51:27.489 --> 51:29.820
But this in itself was
clearly not a crime.

51:33.046 --> 51:35.619
I spoke with former CIA
and military officials.

51:35.649 --> 51:37.120
PHIL GIRALDI
CAREER CIA CASE OFFICER

51:37.150 --> 51:38.771
They argued that
Awlaki's speeches

51:38.801 --> 51:40.455
were inspiring
domestic terrorists.

51:40.485 --> 51:42.040
EMILE NAKHLEH
CIA POLITICAL ISLAM DMSION

51:42.070 --> 51:43.469
There were a lot of words

51:43.505 --> 51:46.450
COL. PATRICK LANG
DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
from both Awlaki and the U.S.
Government

51:46.480 --> 51:48.035
but no concrete
piece of evidence

51:48.065 --> 51:49.508
LT. COL. ANTHONY SHAFFER
CIA - LEADERSHIP TARGETING CELL
that he was an operational figure

51:49.538 --> 51:51.896
LT. COL. ANTHONY SHAFFER
CIA - LEADERSHIP TARGETING CELL
in any attacks.

51:52.748 --> 51:55.377
I remembered seeing him on
TV nearly a decade earlier,

51:55.418 --> 51:57.045
just after 9/11.

51:57.449 --> 51:58.825
ANWAR AL AWLAKI
FALLS CHURCH, VA - 2001

51:58.855 --> 52:00.322
And it was difficult
to reconcile

52:00.356 --> 52:02.290
the image of a new bin Laden

52:02.325 --> 52:05.192
with Awlaki's earlier sermons
condemning terrorism.

52:05.228 --> 52:10.097
The fact that the U.S.
has administered

52:10.133 --> 52:13.863
the death and homicide
of civilians in Iraq

52:13.902 --> 52:18.668
does not justify the killing
of one U.S. Civilian

52:18.706 --> 52:20.936
in New York City or
Washington, D.C.

52:23.578 --> 52:26.639
For a short time, Awlaki
seemed like the go-to imam

52:26.682 --> 52:28.240
for journalists
trying to understand

52:28.283 --> 52:29.773
the experience of
American Muslims

52:29.818 --> 52:31.308
in the wake of the attacks.

52:33.188 --> 52:35.213
He was even profiled
by the Washington Post

52:35.257 --> 52:36.884
for a piece about Ramadan.

52:36.925 --> 52:38.392
After September 11th...

52:41.998 --> 52:43.761
All of the feelings of
the American Muslims

52:43.800 --> 52:45.768
were similar to everybody
else in America:

52:45.802 --> 52:47.963
Feelings of sympathy

52:48.004 --> 52:52.998
for the families of the victims

52:53.042 --> 52:54.771
and a sense of...

52:56.346 --> 52:58.780
That whoever did this needed
to be brought to justice.

52:58.815 --> 53:02.079
A decade after this
video was filmed,

53:02.117 --> 53:05.018
Awlaki had become Public
Enemy Number One,

53:05.053 --> 53:08.647
his name at the very
top of the kill list.

53:08.689 --> 53:11.658
It felt like the War on
Terror was turning on itself.

53:11.692 --> 53:13.126
I was now investigating

53:13.161 --> 53:16.460
the planned assassination
of a U.S. Citizen-

53:16.498 --> 53:17.897
a watershed event.

53:19.072 --> 53:21.158
SANA'A, YEMEN

53:30.413 --> 53:31.607
For the first time,

53:31.648 --> 53:33.741
I had the name of someone
on the kill list

53:33.783 --> 53:35.444
who had not yet been killed.

53:37.153 --> 53:39.621
Anwar al-Awlaki was
now a wanted man

53:39.656 --> 53:41.590
hiding somewhere in the
mountains of Yemen.

53:46.461 --> 53:47.621
I knew I wouldn't be able

53:47.663 --> 53:49.358
to speak with Awlaki directly...

53:50.999 --> 53:53.058
But through a series
of intermediaries,

53:53.101 --> 53:55.126
I managed to set up a
meeting with his father.

53:58.139 --> 54:01.700
I expected him to be reluctant
to speak about his son,

54:01.742 --> 54:03.040
but he seemed happy to reminisce

54:03.078 --> 54:04.238
about an earlier time.

54:06.014 --> 54:09.381
Anwar was an all-American boy.

54:09.418 --> 54:11.613
This is in Disneyland, you know,

54:11.653 --> 54:14.213
in 1984, I think.

54:16.024 --> 54:18.653
This is in San Diego when
he was already an imam

54:18.695 --> 54:20.788
with a big beard, you know.

54:20.830 --> 54:23.799
At that time, he was asking
Muslims to participate

54:23.833 --> 54:25.801
in the democratic
process in America.

54:25.835 --> 54:29.236
In fact, during the presidential
campaign of George Bush,

54:29.272 --> 54:31.763
he thought the
conservative Republicans

54:31.808 --> 54:34.640
will be better than the
liberal Democrats,

54:34.676 --> 54:36.610
and he encouraged
the Muslims there

54:36.645 --> 54:39.170
to elect George Bush.

54:39.214 --> 54:40.408
Didn't he even, at one point,

54:40.449 --> 54:41.848
attend a luncheon
at the Pentagon?

54:41.883 --> 54:43.009
Yes.

54:43.051 --> 54:44.950
You see, he liked America,

54:44.986 --> 54:48.888
and he wanted to stay and
really-his life in America,

54:48.923 --> 54:50.686
but things came differently.

54:54.029 --> 54:57.465
Can you explain to me why
your son went into hiding?

54:57.499 --> 55:00.332
After the incident
of al-Majalah

55:00.369 --> 55:02.462
and Anwar was all over the news,

55:02.504 --> 55:05.167
the drones started
to fly over Shabwah.

55:05.208 --> 55:09.668
So, you know, Anwar
was really concerned.

55:09.712 --> 55:12.510
And so we took his
family with us,

55:12.548 --> 55:15.346
and he left to the mountains.

55:15.385 --> 55:16.943
Hmm?

55:25.227 --> 55:28.890
Myself, at this age in my life,

55:28.930 --> 55:32.798
I really cannot ever replace,

55:32.834 --> 55:35.165
you know, the role of my son

55:35.202 --> 55:39.298
as he was doing for his family.

55:39.340 --> 55:40.899
From my reading of the
history of your son,

55:40.942 --> 55:42.170
from his writing,

55:42.210 --> 55:44.178
it seemed as though there
was a transformation

55:44.212 --> 55:46.544
that happened
politically for him

55:46.581 --> 55:48.276
from 9/11 to the
invasion of Iraq.

55:48.316 --> 55:50.443
Something started to
change in his tone.

55:50.485 --> 55:51.680
Yes.

55:51.721 --> 55:55.657
Anwar became popular
before September 11th

55:55.691 --> 55:59.024
because his sermons
and his tapes,

55:59.062 --> 56:00.359
you know, were very popular

56:00.396 --> 56:03.524
all over the
English-speaking world.

56:03.566 --> 56:07.524
And then the invasion
came in 2003,

56:07.569 --> 56:09.833
and they invaded Iraq
and destroyed Iraq,

56:09.871 --> 56:11.702
so Anwar really started

56:11.740 --> 56:17.542
to be more vocal in his speeches

56:17.579 --> 56:20.070
against what the
Americans were doing

56:20.115 --> 56:22.208
against Muslims all
over the world.

56:22.250 --> 56:23.773
There's no doubt that
your son praised

56:23.818 --> 56:25.217
some of the attacks
against the U.S.

56:25.252 --> 56:26.981
And for many Americans,
it was enough to say,

56:27.021 --> 56:28.420
"Anwar al-Awlaki
is a terrorist."

56:28.456 --> 56:31.551
But also, I want
decent American lawyer

56:31.593 --> 56:33.959
to tell me that it is right

56:33.995 --> 56:35.758
for the United States government

56:35.797 --> 56:37.731
to kill an American citizen

56:37.766 --> 56:39.667
on the basis that
he said something

56:39.702 --> 56:42.796
against the United States or
against American soldiers.

56:42.839 --> 56:44.670
I mean, I-I don't understand.

56:44.707 --> 56:47.870
I don't understand 100% the
American Constitution,

56:47.910 --> 56:51.209
but I don't believe
American law will allow

56:51.247 --> 56:53.147
the killing of an
American citizen

56:53.182 --> 56:56.309
because he said something
against the United States.

57:03.125 --> 57:05.252
Anwar's father may have
been calling for justice

57:05.293 --> 57:06.851
under American law,

57:06.895 --> 57:09.728
but American drones were
already flying overhead.

57:13.167 --> 57:15.635
The fact that they were trying
to kill an American citizen

57:15.669 --> 57:17.330
was shocking enough.

57:17.371 --> 57:20.068
But there was another reason
Awlaki's story haunted me.

57:20.909 --> 57:22.342
We are against evil,

57:22.377 --> 57:24.402
and America as a whole

57:24.446 --> 57:26.574
has turned into a
nation of evil.

57:26.616 --> 57:30.518
How can your conscience
allow you to...

57:30.553 --> 57:32.851
Awlaki seemed to have
embraced the very identity

57:32.889 --> 57:34.914
he once opposed:

57:34.957 --> 57:37.551
The military jacket,
the black flag,

57:37.593 --> 57:39.720
the unequivocal call
for armed jihad.

57:39.762 --> 57:42.594
I specifically invite the youth

57:42.631 --> 57:44.565
to either fight in the West

57:44.599 --> 57:46.999
or join their brothers
in the fronts of jihad.

57:47.035 --> 57:49.333
The all-American boy was gone

57:49.371 --> 57:51.202
and so was the moderate imam.

57:52.641 --> 57:53.801
But why?

58:13.563 --> 58:16.361
Awlaki was deeply affected
by the War on Terror

58:16.399 --> 58:17.957
both abroad and at home.

58:20.269 --> 58:21.566
The day after September 11th,

58:21.604 --> 58:23.902
a woman stumbled into
his mosque in Virginia

58:23.940 --> 58:26.033
after being beaten
with a baseball bat.

58:27.776 --> 58:29.368
More than 1,200
Muslims were detained

58:29.411 --> 58:30.537
across the country.

58:32.280 --> 58:35.215
You have Muslims who
are locked up in jail

58:35.250 --> 58:37.616
and are left to rot in there.

58:37.652 --> 58:39.586
There are no charges
brought against them.

58:40.455 --> 58:41.888
What have you done for them?

58:43.425 --> 58:45.791
Awlaki resigned from
the mosque soon after

58:45.827 --> 58:46.987
and left the country.

58:48.430 --> 58:51.227
But the wars in Afghanistan
and Iraq followed.

58:51.265 --> 58:53.961
And, well, this
is a new kind of-

58:54.001 --> 58:55.195
a new kind of evil.

58:55.236 --> 58:58.365
And this-this-this-this-
this crusade...

59:00.442 --> 59:01.842
Is gonna take a while.

59:01.877 --> 59:04.004
Awlaki began to see
the expanding wars

59:04.046 --> 59:06.412
as part of a global
attack against Islam,

59:06.449 --> 59:09.145
and his sermons reflected
a growing anger.

59:09.185 --> 59:13.383
We are watching one Muslim
nation fall after another,

59:13.422 --> 59:16.185
and we're watching,
sitting back,

59:16.224 --> 59:17.384
doing nothing.

59:20.262 --> 59:21.627
After 9/11,

59:21.663 --> 59:23.324
Awlaki was put under
surveillance,

59:23.365 --> 59:25.060
detained at airports,

59:25.100 --> 59:27.568
and repeatedly
interrogated by the FBI.

59:29.170 --> 59:30.694
When he returned to Yemen,

59:30.739 --> 59:33.731
local officials arrested him
on orders from Washington.

59:33.775 --> 59:35.208
He was locked up for
a year and a half

59:35.243 --> 59:36.733
without charge

59:36.778 --> 59:39.644
and spent 17 months in
solitary confinement.

59:40.581 --> 59:42.515
When he was finally released,

59:42.549 --> 59:44.779
Awlaki was a changed man.

59:44.818 --> 59:47.014
And after JSOC
tried to kill him,

59:47.055 --> 59:48.648
his transformation was complete.

59:48.691 --> 59:51.023
Eventually came
to the conclusion

59:51.060 --> 59:54.257
that jihad against America
is binding upon myself...

59:54.297 --> 59:55.889
This is not a war of choice.

59:55.931 --> 59:59.298
Just as it is binding on
every other able Muslim.

59:59.335 --> 01:00:01.030
This is a war of necessity.

01:00:02.304 --> 01:00:04.397
They seemed like mirror
images of one another,

01:00:04.439 --> 01:00:06.532
strangely distorted,

01:00:06.574 --> 01:00:07.700
America's wars

01:00:07.742 --> 01:00:08.766
and Awlaki's words.

01:00:08.810 --> 01:00:09.936
This will not be quick...

01:00:09.978 --> 01:00:11.275
War against Islam and Muslim...

01:00:11.313 --> 01:00:12.405
Nor easy.

01:00:12.447 --> 01:00:14.472
Like a self-fulfilling
prophecy,

01:00:14.516 --> 01:00:16.609
the United States had
helped create the very man

01:00:16.651 --> 01:00:17.913
it was now trying to kill.

01:00:17.952 --> 01:00:19.112
America was my home.

01:00:19.154 --> 01:00:21.145
Those who attacked
America on 9/11

01:00:21.189 --> 01:00:22.486
are plotting to do so again.

01:00:22.524 --> 01:00:23.821
Awlaki's journey,

01:00:23.858 --> 01:00:26.793
from a voice of moderation
to one of retribution,

01:00:26.828 --> 01:00:28.294
cut to the heart of
the larger story

01:00:28.329 --> 01:00:29.455
I was investigating.

01:00:29.496 --> 01:00:31.623
[Indistinct conversations]

01:00:31.665 --> 01:00:34.133
Anybody...

01:00:34.168 --> 01:00:35.967
Anybody belongs to al-Qaeda...

01:00:37.707 --> 01:00:39.868
I'd seen the same
pattern repeatedly.

01:00:41.677 --> 01:00:43.474
America was trying to
kill its way to victory.

01:00:43.512 --> 01:00:45.036
Now got a new target list...

01:00:45.081 --> 01:00:47.140
But the War on Terror was
producing new enemies

01:00:47.183 --> 01:00:48.342
wherever it spread.

01:00:48.383 --> 01:00:49.543
How did this grow?

01:00:56.624 --> 01:00:58.387
How does a war like
that ever end?

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.525
Good evening.

01:01:07.569 --> 01:01:10.333
Tonight, I can report
to the American people

01:01:10.372 --> 01:01:11.896
and to the world

01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:14.238
that the United States has
conducted an operation

01:01:14.275 --> 01:01:16.573
that killed Osama bin Laden,

01:01:16.611 --> 01:01:18.669
the leader of al-Qaeda.

01:01:18.712 --> 01:01:20.145
Again, for those
just joining us,

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:22.375
Osama bin Laden is dead,

01:01:22.416 --> 01:01:24.214
and one confirmation
we're getting

01:01:24.252 --> 01:01:28.815
indicates that this is a
special operations raid.

01:01:28.858 --> 01:01:30.291
And I think an organization

01:01:30.326 --> 01:01:32.123
we're gonna hear a lot
about in the coming days

01:01:32.161 --> 01:01:35.755
is JSOC, the Joint Special
Operations Command.

01:01:35.797 --> 01:01:37.594
So much for secrecy.

01:01:37.632 --> 01:01:38.929
So much for cover-ups.

01:01:38.967 --> 01:01:41.902
The forces I'd been trying
to unmask since Gardez

01:01:41.936 --> 01:01:43.369
were suddenly national heroes.

01:01:43.405 --> 01:01:46.499
The operation was
called Neptune Spear.

01:01:46.541 --> 01:01:49.476
To capture or kill bin Laden.

01:01:49.511 --> 01:01:52.036
It felt like the world
had turned upside down.

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.674
JSOC, long shrouded in secrecy,

01:01:54.716 --> 01:01:56.377
was becoming a household name.

01:01:58.186 --> 01:01:59.517
But what did it really mean?

01:02:01.689 --> 01:02:03.088
The White House
circulated a photo

01:02:03.124 --> 01:02:04.614
from the night of the raid,

01:02:04.659 --> 01:02:07.286
perhaps as a picture
of transparency.

01:02:07.327 --> 01:02:09.056
Everyone was in the room:

01:02:09.096 --> 01:02:10.428
Secretary of State,

01:02:10.465 --> 01:02:11.796
Secretary of Defense,

01:02:11.833 --> 01:02:13.095
Vice President,

01:02:13.134 --> 01:02:14.727
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs,

01:02:14.770 --> 01:02:16.397
the President himself.

01:02:16.439 --> 01:02:17.804
But it was the
seating arrangement

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:19.205
that interested me.

01:02:19.241 --> 01:02:20.435
The man at the head of the table

01:02:20.476 --> 01:02:22.466
wasn't the commander in chief.

01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:24.603
It was McRaven's
assistant at JSOC,

01:02:24.646 --> 01:02:26.307
General Webb.

01:02:26.347 --> 01:02:29.339
McRaven himself was running the
operation from Afghanistan.

01:02:31.619 --> 01:02:35.419
USA! USA! USA! USA!

01:02:35.457 --> 01:02:37.584
I wasn't mourning
bin Laden's death,

01:02:37.625 --> 01:02:39.252
but I wasn't celebrating either.

01:02:40.995 --> 01:02:44.692
After ten years, I understood
that people wanted closure.

01:02:44.732 --> 01:02:47.394
But it didn't feel
like V-E Day to me.

01:02:47.435 --> 01:02:48.925
Didn't feel like victory at all.

01:02:53.141 --> 01:02:54.631
The leader of
al-Qaeda is dead,

01:02:54.676 --> 01:02:57.200
but a new one has
taken his place.

01:02:57.244 --> 01:03:00.271
Your mission will be to
ensure he meets the same end.

01:03:00.315 --> 01:03:01.942
Hearing JSOC mentioned
on television

01:03:01.983 --> 01:03:03.747
was jolting enough,

01:03:03.786 --> 01:03:06.346
but when I saw the admiral
in front of the cameras,

01:03:06.388 --> 01:03:08.686
it felt like I'd walked
through the looking glass.

01:03:08.724 --> 01:03:11.521
I am deeply honored that the
President has nominated me

01:03:11.559 --> 01:03:13.584
to serve as the next
SOCOM commander.

01:03:13.628 --> 01:03:15.061
And if confirmed...

01:03:15.096 --> 01:03:17.155
William McRaven was now
the toast of Washington.

01:03:17.198 --> 01:03:19.325
Admiral McRaven,

01:03:19.367 --> 01:03:21.665
by leading the mission that
killed Osama bin Laden,

01:03:21.703 --> 01:03:24.467
you and your men won
an enduring place

01:03:24.506 --> 01:03:26.531
in American military history.

01:03:26.574 --> 01:03:29.202
Like all of my colleagues,

01:03:29.244 --> 01:03:31.610
I salute you and
your colleagues'

01:03:31.646 --> 01:03:33.876
and the SEALs'
extraordinary operations.

01:03:33.915 --> 01:03:35.644
Thank you for your service.
Thank you, sir.

01:03:35.683 --> 01:03:37.173
When the congratulations
subsided,

01:03:37.218 --> 01:03:40.187
the senators turned to the
real purpose of the hearings.

01:03:40.221 --> 01:03:43.281
Are you prepared and capable
to expand your operations

01:03:43.324 --> 01:03:45.690
at a moment's notice worldwide?

01:03:45.727 --> 01:03:48.696
As we look out from
Iraq, Afghanistan,

01:03:48.730 --> 01:03:50.698
and, frankly, across the globe,

01:03:50.732 --> 01:03:53.133
as we look at hot spots in Yemen

01:03:53.168 --> 01:03:55.159
where you have al-Qaeda
in the Arabian Peninsula

01:03:55.204 --> 01:03:57.068
or Somalia where you have
East African al-Qaeda

01:03:57.105 --> 01:03:58.367
and al-Shabaab,

01:03:58.406 --> 01:03:59.873
now, these are clearly
areas of concern...

01:03:59.908 --> 01:04:01.170
People in the streets
may have hoped

01:04:01.209 --> 01:04:03.336
the War on Terror
was finally over.

01:04:03.378 --> 01:04:04.675
But in Washington,

01:04:04.712 --> 01:04:06.339
in the corridors of power,

01:04:06.381 --> 01:04:08.110
a new chapter had just begun.

01:04:10.885 --> 01:04:13.479
Right now, it's kinetic.
Hard kill.

01:04:13.521 --> 01:04:15.819
If it's not hard kill,
doesn't get played.

01:04:16.646 --> 01:04:18.296
MALCOLM NANCE
NAVAL INTELLIGENCE

01:04:18.326 --> 01:04:19.884
Soon after the bin Laden strike,

01:04:19.928 --> 01:04:21.122
I met Malcolm Nance,

01:04:21.162 --> 01:04:23.096
a legend in the
world of covert ops

01:04:23.131 --> 01:04:24.564
who'd trained
countless Navy SEALs

01:04:24.599 --> 01:04:27.193
and other JSOC operators.

01:04:27.235 --> 01:04:29.362
I'm a firm believer in
targeted assassination.

01:04:29.404 --> 01:04:32.374
If they are too strong
for your ability

01:04:32.408 --> 01:04:35.069
to negate their capacity
in the battlefield,

01:04:35.109 --> 01:04:37.737
then you're just gonna
have to put a hellfire in.

01:04:37.779 --> 01:04:39.576
If they're- if
they are dangerous

01:04:39.614 --> 01:04:40.638
on a strategic scale

01:04:40.682 --> 01:04:43.173
like Anwar al-Awlaki
from Yemen-

01:04:43.217 --> 01:04:45.082
definitely has a
missile in his future.

01:04:45.119 --> 01:04:47.280
No longer cloaked in secrecy,

01:04:47.322 --> 01:04:48.653
special ops seemed
to be enjoying

01:04:48.690 --> 01:04:50.248
their moment in the sun.

01:04:50.291 --> 01:04:52.384
You know, we went in, we
did the drone strike,

01:04:52.427 --> 01:04:54.088
and-or hellfire strike,

01:04:54.128 --> 01:04:55.595
and we blasted the
individual car

01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:57.757
of a known guy who was known
to be in that vehicle.

01:04:57.799 --> 01:04:59.596
And we flew in, and
we snatched his body-

01:04:59.634 --> 01:05:01.761
we confirmed it- got the
intelligence, went away.

01:05:01.803 --> 01:05:03.395
That's the way we
should be doing it.

01:05:08.977 --> 01:05:10.604
The first time we met,

01:05:10.645 --> 01:05:13.011
he'd called me out of the blue.

01:05:13.047 --> 01:05:14.537
This time, it was me who called.

01:05:16.985 --> 01:05:19.819
JSOC may no longer
have been a secret,

01:05:19.855 --> 01:05:21.516
but that didn't mean
we knew the truth.

01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:29.800
We're now seeing the effects of covert
intervention in countries on multiple continents

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:36.750
without any thought to future repercussions.
And it is radically expanded.

01:05:36.751 --> 01:05:41.400
At one point it was 40 countries.
It is now expanded to over 75.

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:47.900
And there are dozens, if not
hundreds, of concurrent operations.

01:05:48.049 --> 01:05:50.210
But, in theory, Congress is
supposed to have oversight

01:05:50.251 --> 01:05:51.411
of these operations.

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:56.300
They don't want to step into the dark
and see what goes on behind the curtain.

01:05:56.500 --> 01:06:02.400
Joint Special Operations Command became
a paramilitary arm of the administration.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:07.800
And billions upon billions
of dollars was poured into JSOC.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.900
What we have essentially done
is created one hell of a hammer.

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:18.000
And for the rest of our generation,
for the rest of my lifetime,

01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:23.000
this force will be continually
searching for a nail.

01:06:29.023 --> 01:06:31.890
Bin Laden's death had given
the War on Terror new life.

01:06:34.796 --> 01:06:37.993
After 9/11, there were seven
people on the kill list.

01:06:38.032 --> 01:06:40.865
In Iraq, 55 on the
deck of cards.

01:06:40.902 --> 01:06:42.893
By Afghanistan, there
were thousands.

01:06:44.739 --> 01:06:47.367
But now the list
itself was changing.

01:06:47.408 --> 01:06:48.773
Signature strikes,

01:06:48.810 --> 01:06:49.799
TADS,

01:06:49.844 --> 01:06:51.675
crowd killing-

01:06:51.713 --> 01:06:53.442
a target list was
no longer needed

01:06:53.481 --> 01:06:55.507
to justify a strike
like al-Majalah.

01:06:56.819 --> 01:06:58.684
All boys over the age of 15,

01:06:58.721 --> 01:07:00.620
all men under the age of 70

01:07:00.655 --> 01:07:02.987
were now fair game
in targeted areas.

01:07:04.958 --> 01:07:06.448
Like a flywheel,

01:07:06.493 --> 01:07:09.054
the global War on Terror was
spinning out of control.

01:07:18.806 --> 01:07:20.273
When I began this story,

01:07:20.308 --> 01:07:22.776
the U.S. was at war in
Iraq and Afghanistan.

01:07:24.145 --> 01:07:26.272
The bombing in al-Majalah
brought me to Yemen.

01:07:27.115 --> 01:07:28.548
But the list of countries

01:07:28.583 --> 01:07:31.313
where U.S. Special Forces
were operating had grown,

01:07:31.352 --> 01:07:33.047
just as the kill list had.

01:07:34.489 --> 01:07:36.013
Algeria, Indonesia,

01:07:36.057 --> 01:07:39.390
Thailand, Panama, Jordan-

01:07:39.427 --> 01:07:41.361
the world was now a battlefield.

01:07:43.198 --> 01:07:46.133
It was hard to know
where to go next.

01:07:46.168 --> 01:07:49.159
In Pakistan, the U.S. was
launching weekly drone strikes.

01:07:49.203 --> 01:07:51.500
In Mali, they were
hunting al-Qaeda.

01:07:51.538 --> 01:07:54.234
In Latin America,
targeting drug cartels.

01:07:55.509 --> 01:07:57.534
I decided to go to Somalia,

01:07:57.577 --> 01:07:59.205
where an escalated
kill/capture program

01:07:59.247 --> 01:08:00.407
was under way.

01:08:07.822 --> 01:08:09.949
Just as McRaven had testified,

01:08:09.991 --> 01:08:12.084
the war was erupting
in East Africa.

01:08:13.694 --> 01:08:15.662
Drone strikes were increasing.

01:08:15.696 --> 01:08:18.460
There were suicide bombings
in Kampala and Mogadishu.

01:08:18.499 --> 01:08:20.228
And JSOC was on the ground,

01:08:20.268 --> 01:08:22.236
snatching bodies and
flying them back to ships

01:08:22.270 --> 01:08:23.612
in the Arabian Sea.

01:08:23.642 --> 01:08:25.935
ADEN ADDE AIRPORT
MOGADISHU, SOMALIA

01:08:26.941 --> 01:08:28.738
Almost as soon as I arrived,

01:08:28.776 --> 01:08:30.573
I sensed that things
weren't going to go well.

01:08:34.049 --> 01:08:36.984
Mogadishu was seeing its
worst fighting in years,

01:08:37.019 --> 01:08:39.247
and there were no foreign
journalists left in the city.

01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:42.388
My local contact, Bashir Osman,

01:08:42.421 --> 01:08:44.049
was worried about my safety.

01:08:44.090 --> 01:08:45.057
Okay?

01:08:45.091 --> 01:08:46.319
It's okay.

01:08:46.359 --> 01:08:47.417
All right.

01:08:53.267 --> 01:08:54.894
It was a strange feeling,

01:08:54.935 --> 01:08:56.301
traveling with a dozen armed men

01:08:56.337 --> 01:08:57.497
in a decoy car.

01:08:58.805 --> 01:09:00.774
I still had my
reporter's notebook,

01:09:00.808 --> 01:09:03.140
but what could I learn in
conditions like these?

01:09:10.585 --> 01:09:13.053
Before arriving in Somalia,
I had read reports

01:09:13.087 --> 01:09:15.055
that the U.S. was
outsourcing the kill lists

01:09:15.089 --> 01:09:16.886
to local warlords.

01:09:19.895 --> 01:09:21.886
Among the most
powerful in Mogadishu

01:09:21.930 --> 01:09:23.727
was Yusuf Mohamed Siad,

01:09:23.765 --> 01:09:25.823
known by everyone as Indha Adde,

01:09:25.867 --> 01:09:27.390
"White Eyes."

01:09:31.001 --> 01:09:33.337
GEN. INDHA ADDE
US-BACKED SOMALI ARMY

01:09:35.942 --> 01:09:38.969
In an earlier life, Indha Adde
had been America's enemy,

01:09:39.013 --> 01:09:42.413
offering protection to people
on the U.S. kill list.

01:09:42.450 --> 01:09:44.350
But the warlord had
since changed sides.

01:09:44.385 --> 01:09:46.944
He was now on the U.S. payroll

01:09:46.988 --> 01:09:49.252
and assumed the
title of general.

01:09:49.290 --> 01:09:51.019
So he's saying that
the fiercest fighting

01:09:51.058 --> 01:09:53.390
that they're doing right now
is happening right here.

01:09:56.864 --> 01:09:57.956
Okay.

The men fired across
the rooftops,

01:10:09.878 --> 01:10:12.277
but it didn't make sense to
me what we were doing here...

01:10:13.748 --> 01:10:16.181
Or what the Americans were
doing here in Somalia,

01:10:16.216 --> 01:10:18.013

Yes, two, uh-huh.

If we capture foreign
fighters alive, we bury them.

We kill them
when we catch them.

If you capture a
foreigner alive,

01:10:42.643 --> 01:10:44.133
you execute them on
the battlefield?

01:10:44.658 --> 01:10:45.826
Yes.

foreigners expect no mercy.

01:11:05.131 --> 01:11:07.463
How did the Americans
find men like Indha Adde?

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:08.831
And to what end?

01:11:11.171 --> 01:11:12.968
After a decade of covert war,

01:11:13.006 --> 01:11:14.736
Somalia was in ruins.

01:11:14.775 --> 01:11:16.402
Half the country was ruled

01:12:14.869 --> 01:12:16.837
was Washington's
man in Mogadishu.

01:12:16.871 --> 01:12:19.203

Qanyare's services

America knows war.

funding a war, they know how to fund it.

entered a second decade,

what not what I expected.

but I wasn't sure why.

01:15:41.942 --> 01:15:43.876
Was it to file another story?

01:15:43.911 --> 01:15:46.004
To investigate another crime?

01:15:47.014 --> 01:15:48.811

Abdulrahman left
without telling us.

that he's going to
look for his father.

01:16:22.383 --> 01:16:25.012
He left from the kitchen window,

01:16:25.053 --> 01:16:28.215
and he took a bus to the
governorate of Shabwah.

01:16:29.757 --> 01:16:31.622
Then when his father was killed,

01:16:31.659 --> 01:16:34.093
his grandmother told him,

01:16:34.128 --> 01:16:36.790
"There is no use for
you to stay anymore."

01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:40.027
And he said, "Yes, I will
come back in two days."

On the morning of October 15th,

01:16:51.244 --> 01:16:52.734
we got a telephone call,

blown up to pieces

01:16:55.948 --> 01:16:57.415
by the drone.

01:16:58.651 --> 01:17:01.120
And they saw only the
back of his hair.

01:17:01.155 --> 01:17:02.952
You know, his
relative, his cousin,

01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:04.753
he knew his hair from the back,

01:17:04.792 --> 01:17:07.317
and he recognize it, and he knew

01:17:07.361 --> 01:17:10.194
that Abdulrahman
really was dead.

01:17:10.230 --> 01:17:13.427
But they could not recognize
his face or anything else.

01:17:16.670 --> 01:17:17.830

he should do that.

of Abdulrahman

01:17:37.323 --> 01:17:39.120

why I was here.

01:17:42.595 --> 01:17:45.291

another death.

for a moment to talk.

01:18:37.284 --> 01:18:40.685
Who ordered the killing
of Abdulrahman?

01:18:40.721 --> 01:18:43.815
He was sitting, having
dinner with his friends.

01:18:43.857 --> 01:18:45.485

01:18:45.527 --> 01:18:46.891

01:18:48.195 --> 01:18:49.685
You know, Abdulrahman was...

01:18:51.031 --> 01:18:53.556
He was a very, very gentle boy,

01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:55.625
and he never hurt anybody.

01:19:15.188 --> 01:19:17.554
I tried to make sense
of Abdulrahman's death.

01:19:20.226 --> 01:19:22.694
His father's could at
least be explained.

01:19:22.728 --> 01:19:24.423
But a teenager with
a Facebook page

01:19:24.464 --> 01:19:27.263
and a group of
adolescent friends,

01:19:27.301 --> 01:19:30.429
why would his name have
been put on the list?

01:19:30.471 --> 01:19:32.234
What could he
possibly have done?

but they offered no
explanation for the strike.

01:19:50.924 --> 01:19:53.757
And unlike Gardez,
they made no apology.

01:19:57.064 --> 01:19:59.055
It seemed an impossible
coincidence.

They killed the father

01:20:02.236 --> 01:20:03.396
and then the son.

01:20:12.378 --> 01:20:14.608
But maybe it was
as simple as that.

01:20:16.517 --> 01:20:19.509
Like a tale from
Greek mythology,

01:20:19.553 --> 01:20:22.420
Abdulrahman was killed
not for what he'd done

01:20:22.456 --> 01:20:24.515
but for who he might
one day become...

01:20:26.493 --> 01:20:28.484
A twisted logic,

But what did we lose
when the drone struck

teenage friends?

When I first visited Gardez,

01:21:20.147 --> 01:21:22.377
I had no idea where the
story would lead me.

01:21:28.956 --> 01:21:31.481
I didn't know just how much
the world had changed...

would change me.

story has no end.
