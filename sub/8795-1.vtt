02:56.677 --> 02:58.177
What?

02:58.178 --> 02:59.178
I don't understand.

02:59.179 --> 03:02.556
Jim, listen to me, don't let
your imagination run wild.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.684
It's a transitional period.

03:04.685 --> 03:07.937
So you're firing me for
no real reason then?

03:07.938 --> 03:10.856
Well, there's a little
more to it than that.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.889
- What do you mean?
- I can't really discuss it right now.

03:15.195 --> 03:15.945
Why not?

03:15.946 --> 03:17.571
What else is goin' on Roger?

03:17.572 --> 03:19.949
Sorry old boy, I'm
just the messenger.

03:19.950 --> 03:21.325
Do give my best to the family.

03:21.326 --> 03:24.286
Oh, and don't forget about Soarin'.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.205
My boys just won't
stop talking about it.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.290
They say you actually
feel like you're flying.

03:28.291 --> 03:29.458
Sounds lovely... Well...

03:29.459 --> 03:30.543
Hey wait Roger, please!

03:30.544 --> 03:33.072
Best of luck.

03:48.395 --> 03:49.478
No don't! Elliot!

03:49.479 --> 03:52.398
Elliot. Get back here!

03:52.399 --> 03:54.301
Elliot!

03:54.860 --> 03:56.527
Come on, open the door.

03:56.528 --> 03:57.804
Open the door.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.003
Jim?

04:30.771 --> 04:33.219
Jim?

04:33.774 --> 04:36.442
Where are you?

04:36.443 --> 04:38.444
Let's go.
Hey guys! Sara, wait up!

04:38.445 --> 04:40.696
Oh my god. She doesn't
even listen to me.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.907
Well she's just excited.
It's this place, you know.

04:42.908 --> 04:44.408
Hey now, you're way
too nice to her.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.577
You have to, like,
not be so nice to them.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.496
Not make me look
like the bad person.

04:48.497 --> 04:50.039
What about him?

04:50.040 --> 04:52.625
Elliot, apologize to your father.

04:52.626 --> 04:53.459
No!

04:53.460 --> 04:54.960
What? Did you hear that?

04:54.961 --> 04:57.546
I don't know what's into him.
He's acting a little strange today.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.799
He's just a little
different, that's all.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.301
Um, who were you talking
to on the balcony?

05:02.302 --> 05:02.968
What?

05:02.969 --> 05:05.554
Yeah, who were you talking to?

05:05.555 --> 05:08.974
Nobody, I wasn't talking to anybody.
So, you're lips were moving?

05:08.975 --> 05:10.726
What are you, a lip reader now?

05:10.727 --> 05:11.519
Yes I am.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.395
- I was just talking to...
- I wanna believe you.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.439
But it was a little weird.
Tell me what's going on.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.565
Honey, it was no one.

05:16.566 --> 05:20.528
Look, I wanna have one final
decent last day here, okay?

05:20.529 --> 05:22.071
That's all I ask, alright?

05:22.072 --> 05:23.072
Okay.

05:23.073 --> 05:24.573
Alright. It's our last day.

05:24.574 --> 05:27.944
- Let's go guys.
- Get in honey.

05:31.081 --> 05:32.357
Nice.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.669
Look, the train's
about ready to come.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.671
Look, it's gonna be coming
down those tracks down there.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.870
- Can you see it?
- Yeah!

05:49.391 --> 05:52.886
Please stand clear of the doors.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.688
Come on guys. Here we go.

05:55.689 --> 05:56.931
Everybody in.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.067
Let me sit over here in the corner.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.111
Okay guys.

06:02.112 --> 06:04.697
Elliot, sit down.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.146
Sit down, Elliot.

06:10.787 --> 06:13.372
- Elliot, sit down!
- Sit down honey.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.026
Please sit down, Elliot.

06:16.585 --> 06:19.905
Now stopping at Disney's
Polynesian Resort.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.168
Please hold on to the handrails

06:59.169 --> 07:03.797
and stand clear of the doors until
the monorail stops completely

07:03.798 --> 07:05.450
and the doors open.

07:09.429 --> 07:13.379
Oh, the humidity, my gosh!

07:18.188 --> 07:19.939
Can we go on Buzz Lightyear?

07:19.940 --> 07:20.940
Ask your father.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.024
Can we Dad?

07:22.025 --> 07:23.192
We'll see, honey.

07:23.193 --> 07:24.902
Depends how long the line is.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.225
Okay.

07:34.204 --> 07:37.039
Okay, we need to get a
picture with the castle.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.667
The whole family.

07:39.668 --> 07:42.711
Picture of the castle.

07:42.712 --> 07:43.629
Let's do it.

07:43.630 --> 07:44.922
That will work!

07:44.923 --> 07:47.216
- Say Mickey!
- Mickey!

07:47.217 --> 07:50.135
- And Minnie!
- Minnie!

07:50.136 --> 07:52.584
There you go!

07:55.475 --> 07:58.185
Oh, that's beautiful, wow.

07:58.186 --> 08:00.338
That's so cute.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.564
They do have everything.

08:02.565 --> 08:05.184
You wanna go on the, uh, thing?

08:05.819 --> 08:06.986
Are you scared, sweetie?

08:06.987 --> 08:08.821
I don't like the witch.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.740
Nobody does... nobody does.

08:11.741 --> 08:13.742
- She's afraid.
- No I'm not!

08:13.743 --> 08:15.536
Uh huh.

08:15.537 --> 08:17.496
It's not scary. I've
been on it before.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.039
See, it's different.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.874
They make this for
little tiny kids.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.002
It's not scary. You can hold
daddy's hand really tight.

08:23.003 --> 08:26.873
- Honey the line, the line.
- Okay, okay.

08:53.074 --> 08:55.075
Oh no, here she comes.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.899
There she is, the wicked witch!

08:59.247 --> 09:01.081
She's just pretend, right?

09:01.082 --> 09:02.207
That's right.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.792
Witches aren't real.

09:03.793 --> 09:06.571
No.

09:07.047 --> 09:11.293
And they lived happily
ever after. Yay!

09:33.031 --> 09:35.115
This is so cute!

09:35.116 --> 09:39.244
- Look at flying Pooh.
- Hey baby, come on.

09:39.245 --> 09:43.040
- No, honey, not now, the kids!
- What are you worried about?

09:43.041 --> 09:45.084
- The kids! Not now!
- Come on.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.252
What?

09:47.253 --> 09:49.213
No one's around. Come on.

09:49.214 --> 09:50.881
- Not in front of the kids.
- Tigger!

09:50.882 --> 09:53.050
No, keep your hands... honey...

09:53.051 --> 09:54.301
Not here. No.

09:54.302 --> 09:58.502
Not in front of the kids. No. Stop.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.968
- Come on.
- Jim.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.115
You're such a downer.

10:16.116 --> 10:19.565
- You're such a Debbie Downer.
- No.

10:25.792 --> 10:29.795
<i>♪ La la la la lala lala la ♪</i>

10:29.796 --> 10:33.075
<i>♪ lala lala la lala la la la la la ♪</i>

10:45.311 --> 10:48.355
- Sit down Jim.
- Sorry... it's just...

10:48.356 --> 10:51.509
<i>♪ lala la la la la la
lala la la la la la ♪</i>

11:34.861 --> 11:38.864
I hate you.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.767
What?

11:43.244 --> 11:45.738
What did she say?

11:46.206 --> 11:49.735
Hate's a bad word.

11:50.293 --> 11:52.616
No, Mommy didn't mean it, honey.

11:59.093 --> 12:01.416
Something's wrong with Elliot.

12:01.846 --> 12:06.376
Oh, you're not his father.

12:18.321 --> 12:20.906
<i>♪ lala lala la la la la la ♪</i>

12:20.907 --> 12:22.684
<i>♪ lala lala la la la la ♪</i>

12:39.092 --> 12:41.468
That was fun.

12:41.469 --> 12:43.303
Hey, honey?

12:43.304 --> 12:46.473
Did that... seem normal to you?

12:46.474 --> 12:47.266
What do you mean?

12:47.267 --> 12:49.476
Now can we go on Buzz Lightyear?

12:49.477 --> 12:51.353
I don't like that ride.

12:51.354 --> 12:55.482
- Guys.
- I wanna go on the teacups.

12:55.483 --> 12:56.775
Jim...

12:56.776 --> 12:57.776
What?

12:57.777 --> 12:59.444
Wanna take her?

12:59.445 --> 13:00.279
Yeah...

13:00.280 --> 13:02.114
Uh, no, no actually you take her

13:02.115 --> 13:03.949
and I'll take him
on Buzz Lightyear.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.409
- Yes!
- Alright!

13:05.410 --> 13:06.451
Okay, then.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.120
We'll meet you back at
the carousel in an hour.

13:08.121 --> 13:11.248
- Okay.
- Have fun!

13:11.249 --> 13:13.697
- Okay. Alright.
- Muah muah muah, love you!

13:15.962 --> 13:18.865
Get your astro-blasters
ready, space cadets!

13:25.513 --> 13:27.472
Wooh!

13:27.473 --> 13:30.467
Wooh!

13:38.985 --> 13:40.352
Wooh!

13:42.864 --> 13:45.532
You know honey,
this might be a while.

13:45.533 --> 13:46.775
Yep.

13:47.452 --> 13:50.495
You sure you don't want to get a
fast pass, we'll come back later?

13:50.496 --> 13:52.944
That's okay.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.125
We could ride something else.

13:55.126 --> 13:56.698
Uh-uh.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.369
You really like this ride, huh?

14:10.850 --> 14:13.518
Let's wave to our fans! Hello!

14:13.519 --> 14:18.675
Hello! Hello!

14:23.863 --> 14:25.364
Let's see how long the line is.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.323
You see how long it is?

14:26.324 --> 14:29.034
Whoa. Yep.

14:29.035 --> 14:31.904
It's gonna take forever.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.574
Oh man.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.419
Alright! Wooh!

14:39.420 --> 14:41.788
Giddyup.

14:52.350 --> 14:55.894
No, we're still in line.

14:55.895 --> 14:59.064
I don't know, it's not really movin'. You?
We're gonna get something to eat,

14:59.065 --> 15:01.441
because this one looks like
she's about ready to fade.

15:01.442 --> 15:02.901
- Okay?
- Alright.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.430
I'll call you if we ever
get out of here. Alright?

15:06.614 --> 15:07.981
Alright.

15:13.371 --> 15:16.498
Bam bam bam bam bam.

15:16.499 --> 15:19.573
I sliced him apart.

15:22.088 --> 15:25.924
Sorry space rangers, this
ride is no longer in service.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.552
Please proceed to the nearest
exit and have a great day.

15:28.553 --> 15:32.878
Oh my... you gotta be
fucking kidding me.

15:34.517 --> 15:36.685
I'm sorry little man.

15:36.686 --> 15:39.396
Looks like someone does not
want us to go on this one.

15:39.397 --> 15:41.356
What happened?

15:41.357 --> 15:42.804
I don't know.

15:54.162 --> 15:56.288
- You hungry?
- No.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.206
Hey, you wanna go on Pirates?

15:58.207 --> 15:59.779
No.

16:08.593 --> 16:10.010
Dad?

16:10.011 --> 16:11.628
Yeah...

17:08.194 --> 17:10.194
This is fun.

17:10.195 --> 17:11.613
Uh-huh.

17:11.614 --> 17:15.689
Don't slow down no matter what.

17:19.579 --> 17:22.574
Let's step on the gas!

17:31.759 --> 17:33.627
'Moi' is 'me' right?

17:34.637 --> 17:37.756
Oh my... you like a big nose?

17:39.392 --> 17:43.592
- Oh my! Ooh-la-la! Wow.
- Oh-la-la!

17:48.484 --> 17:49.885
You alright?

17:54.448 --> 17:57.601
They like it.

18:34.697 --> 18:36.064
Aah!

19:05.478 --> 19:07.630
Come on.

19:11.192 --> 19:13.845
- Yes.
- Okay, right here.

19:30.211 --> 19:31.628
- Dad?
- Yeah?

19:31.629 --> 19:34.214
Why are we following those girls?

19:34.215 --> 19:35.674
Girls, what girls?

19:35.675 --> 19:36.174
Bonjour!

19:36.175 --> 19:38.760
Those girls!

19:38.761 --> 19:41.346
Oh... well, um...

19:41.347 --> 19:42.847
I guess they just like
the same rides as we do.

19:42.848 --> 19:45.684
- Oh. Dad?
- Yeah?

19:45.685 --> 19:46.893
They're pretty, huh?

19:46.894 --> 19:51.523
Well, yeah, pretty? It depends
on your definition of pretty.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.942
- Do you think they're pretty?
- I guess.

19:53.943 --> 19:56.778
Well then, there you go.
That's your definition.

19:56.779 --> 19:59.557
Is Mommy pretty?

20:00.366 --> 20:02.701
You're mother?
Yeah, she's beautiful.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.070
- I think so too.
- Yeah.

20:07.498 --> 20:09.916
I mean not in a classical... sense.

20:09.917 --> 20:12.961
But more in a... Emily
Dickinson... kind of...

20:12.962 --> 20:15.922
bookish... Tina Fey kind of thing.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.291
Yeah, but she's beautiful, yeah.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.397
Hey, hon. We're over
here by the castle.

20:32.398 --> 20:33.773
Just wondering where you are.

20:33.774 --> 20:36.597
Call me when you get this, okay?

20:37.903 --> 20:38.778
Where's Daddy?

20:38.779 --> 20:40.822
I don't know!

20:40.823 --> 20:44.067
Let's go find him, okay?

20:50.833 --> 20:53.293
What?

20:53.294 --> 20:54.711
Space Mountain?

20:54.712 --> 20:56.796
What's the matter?
That's a big kids' ride.

20:56.797 --> 21:00.167
You're a big kid, aren't you?

21:01.761 --> 21:04.012
What? Hey...

21:04.013 --> 21:07.974
do you remember when you
were afraid of the teacups?

21:07.975 --> 21:09.217
Same thing.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.059
Hey.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.400
Come on. Let's o.

21:59.401 --> 22:01.769
Look!

22:01.946 --> 22:02.987
Elliot?

22:02.988 --> 22:05.857
Oh there's Mommy. There she is.

22:06.367 --> 22:07.909
What's wrong baby? What's wrong?

22:07.910 --> 22:10.787
Jim, we've been waiting
for you for over an hour.

22:10.788 --> 22:12.664
- I am so sorry, Em...
- Why didn't you answer your phone?

22:12.665 --> 22:15.033
I'm sorry Em.

22:16.502 --> 22:17.836
Is this vomit?

22:17.837 --> 22:19.379
I threw up.

22:19.380 --> 22:21.047
Oh, sweetie...

22:21.048 --> 22:22.507
What happened?

22:22.508 --> 22:24.968
Dad made me go on Space Mountain.

22:24.969 --> 22:26.511
I didn't make him go.

22:26.512 --> 22:27.929
You took him on Space Mountain?!

22:27.930 --> 22:29.889
What's wrong with you?

22:29.890 --> 22:31.516
Did you black out again?

22:31.517 --> 22:33.351
He could barely
handle the tea cups!

22:33.352 --> 22:34.936
You didn't think Space
Mountain would freak him out?

22:34.937 --> 22:38.216
Thanks. Thanks so much.

22:39.942 --> 22:41.067
Did she eat?

22:41.068 --> 22:42.569
No, she did not.

22:42.570 --> 22:43.736
- Well why not?
- I don't know.

22:43.737 --> 22:45.530
Why don't you ask her?

22:45.531 --> 22:47.949
Why didn't you eat, baby?

22:47.950 --> 22:48.950
Come on, let's go.

22:48.951 --> 22:50.827
Wait, wait, Em, what?

22:50.828 --> 22:52.704
You wanna go lie down with Mommy?

22:52.705 --> 22:54.414
- Yeah.
- No, wait!

22:54.415 --> 22:57.709
I don't wanna go, I wanna
stay here with you.

22:57.710 --> 22:58.960
Fine, fine.

22:58.961 --> 23:02.005
Alright fine. I'll
stay here with her.

23:02.006 --> 23:04.007
Okay, fine.

23:04.008 --> 23:05.925
Wait wait wait, Em... Em.

23:05.926 --> 23:07.873
What?

23:08.470 --> 23:12.390
Alright. Feel better, little man.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.434
Come on Elliot, let's go.
We're gonna go lie down.

23:14.435 --> 23:15.518
Feel better, honey!

23:15.519 --> 23:18.688
I'll see you back at the hotel.

23:18.689 --> 23:19.981
- You're not hungry?
- No.

23:19.982 --> 23:22.350
At all?

23:30.743 --> 23:33.111
Oh I'm gettin' the train, honey.

23:36.832 --> 23:37.916
Alright ready? Here we go.

23:37.917 --> 23:41.461
Bleagh.

23:41.462 --> 23:43.489
That's not funny, is it?

23:48.010 --> 23:51.084
There we go. C'mon, let's go.

23:52.014 --> 23:54.087
Fun, huh?

23:57.102 --> 23:59.479
Wow, look at this!

23:59.480 --> 24:01.507
Look at this.

24:15.037 --> 24:17.163
Hey, hey, come here.

24:17.164 --> 24:19.532
Come on.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.922
I've seen enough of this
tree house. Let's get down.

24:25.923 --> 24:28.496
Do some other fun stuff.

24:31.095 --> 24:34.055
Excuse me.

24:34.056 --> 24:35.378
Wooh.

24:48.696 --> 24:52.145
Wow. Here we are on a new island.

24:53.575 --> 24:54.826
Come on!

24:54.827 --> 24:55.994
I'm coming, I'm coming.

24:55.995 --> 24:58.864
- Come on!
- I'm coming.

24:59.039 --> 25:01.124
Come on. Here it comes.

25:01.125 --> 25:03.903
Keep goin'!

25:18.517 --> 25:20.510
Whoa, Jesus Christ.

25:22.062 --> 25:23.622
I'll be right there, sweetie.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.108
Where are we going?

25:27.109 --> 25:29.819
Whoa, are we serious?

25:29.820 --> 25:32.697
Can we go down there? Alright.

25:32.698 --> 25:34.115
This is cool!

25:34.116 --> 25:35.533
Ouch.

25:35.534 --> 25:38.077
I think I'm too fat
for this cave, honey.

25:38.078 --> 25:39.579
I smashed my head.

25:39.580 --> 25:41.956
Sweetie wait, Sara.

25:41.957 --> 25:45.327
Not so fast, not so fast.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.964
Sara?

25:49.965 --> 25:50.911
Honey?

25:56.889 --> 25:58.586
Honey.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.852
Honey, where did you go?

26:02.853 --> 26:04.425
Honey?

26:05.731 --> 26:07.599
Okay, Sara, it's not funny.

26:11.653 --> 26:12.929
- Ooh!
- Ugh!

26:38.972 --> 26:39.998
Sara?

26:46.897 --> 26:47.968
It hurts.

26:48.607 --> 26:49.724
Sara!

26:50.901 --> 26:54.475
Sara. Is that your name?

26:55.030 --> 26:56.614
There you are.

26:56.615 --> 26:59.109
He pushed me.

26:59.868 --> 27:03.621
See, they kind of...
bumped into each other.

27:03.622 --> 27:07.117
Tell your kid to watch where
he's going next time.

27:09.670 --> 27:13.324
Come on, honey, let's go.

27:28.897 --> 27:30.815
Are you having lots
and lots of fun?

27:30.816 --> 27:34.652
Uh-huh. I went on Snow White
and wasn't afraid of the witch

27:34.653 --> 27:37.780
'cause... she was just pretend.

27:37.781 --> 27:40.825
Wow. You're a big girl, huh?

27:40.826 --> 27:42.603
Uh-huh.

27:56.341 --> 27:58.843
There you go.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.261
Good as new.

28:00.262 --> 28:03.973
How's she doin' otherwise?

28:03.974 --> 28:04.974
Good.

28:04.975 --> 28:09.103
No coughing or flu-like symptoms?

28:09.104 --> 28:10.426
No.

28:10.731 --> 28:11.981
And you?

28:11.982 --> 28:13.725
Me?

28:14.026 --> 28:16.520
I take vitamin C.

28:17.112 --> 28:19.822
Everyone's so worried
about cat flu, now.

28:19.823 --> 28:23.117
Children are most at risk so
we have to be extra careful.

28:23.118 --> 28:25.119
Mommies and daddies, too.

28:25.120 --> 28:29.195
You could be a host
and not even know it.

28:37.174 --> 28:39.076
Lolly?

28:42.137 --> 28:44.084
How 'bout one for Dad?

28:45.140 --> 28:47.725
Um... sure, thanks.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.424
Okay, better get goin'.

28:51.021 --> 28:53.022
Come on, sweetie.

28:53.023 --> 28:54.766
- Thanks again.
- Mm-hmm.

28:57.945 --> 29:00.097
Be careful out there.

29:06.411 --> 29:11.123
This one's a little
hotter, it's about 2,350.

29:11.124 --> 29:14.118
That's gonna be our base, I'll
show you how fast this goes.

29:26.932 --> 29:28.432
You think that's good?

29:28.433 --> 29:29.976
Turkey leg?

29:29.977 --> 29:32.755
- That's gonna be eight dollars.
- Thank you.

29:37.317 --> 29:39.685
Come back! Stop!

29:53.500 --> 29:56.335
That's not turkey, you know.

29:56.336 --> 29:57.211
Hmm?

29:57.212 --> 30:00.965
What you're eating.
It's not turkey.

30:00.966 --> 30:02.162
No?

30:04.511 --> 30:06.345
Well if it's not turkey,
then what is it?

30:06.346 --> 30:08.097
You really wanna know?

30:08.098 --> 30:09.974
Well...

30:09.975 --> 30:11.851
Now you have to tell me.

30:11.852 --> 30:14.721
Emu.

30:14.896 --> 30:15.980
What?

30:15.981 --> 30:17.553
Emu.

30:17.983 --> 30:18.983
Emu?

30:18.984 --> 30:20.852
It's a bird.

30:21.820 --> 30:24.822
Well, uh... why don't
they just call it that?

30:24.823 --> 30:27.692
Well, would you really
buy it if they did?

30:29.202 --> 30:31.954
No, I guess not.

30:31.955 --> 30:34.248
Which one's yours?

30:34.249 --> 30:37.744
Oh... over there.

30:41.006 --> 30:42.506
She's beautiful.

30:42.507 --> 30:43.507
Thanks.

30:43.508 --> 30:47.538
No, I mean, she's lovely.
A real princess.

30:49.389 --> 30:51.891
Looks like they're friends already.

30:51.892 --> 30:52.850
Hmm?

30:52.851 --> 30:55.595
Oh, the boy, he's mine.

30:56.104 --> 30:58.147
Yeah?

30:58.148 --> 31:00.391
Yeah.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.151
- Hmm.
- Oh!

31:02.152 --> 31:04.350
- I have a little...
- Here.

31:10.369 --> 31:11.160
Thanks.

31:11.161 --> 31:15.532
It's humid today.

31:16.291 --> 31:19.240
I don't really mind it, though.

31:27.469 --> 31:28.427
Oh, thank you.

31:28.428 --> 31:30.546
- You okay?
- Yeah.

31:33.183 --> 31:35.893
Has she met all the princesses yet?

31:35.894 --> 31:39.063
She has indeed.

31:39.064 --> 31:42.066
Don't you think it's strange?
The princesses?

31:42.067 --> 31:46.070
Pretending to be someone else,
hugging all these kids.

31:46.071 --> 31:47.613
Um... yeah, I guess.

31:47.614 --> 31:51.158
I wonder what age we
stop wanting to do that.

31:51.159 --> 31:53.687
Hug a perfect stranger.

31:54.454 --> 31:58.529
I suppose they aren't really
strangers now, are they?

32:05.298 --> 32:06.590
Everything alright?

32:06.591 --> 32:08.288
What?

32:08.593 --> 32:10.791
Oh, I'm sorry, I...

32:11.596 --> 32:13.097
Oh, your necklace...
you're necklace.

32:13.098 --> 32:14.390
I meant your necklace, sorry.

32:14.391 --> 32:16.225
You like it?

32:16.226 --> 32:18.394
Yeah, it's uh...

32:18.395 --> 32:19.353
It's um...

32:19.354 --> 32:20.938
It's what?

32:20.939 --> 32:25.526
I dunno, there's just...
something about it though...

32:25.527 --> 32:30.057
It's an heirloom from another time.

32:30.657 --> 32:34.982
Yeah... wow...

32:39.249 --> 32:40.491
Ow.

32:43.003 --> 32:46.464
Fuck me. Feel my vagina.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.382
What the... wait a minute...

32:48.383 --> 32:51.260
I think you found my hidden
Mickey! Hysterectomy.

32:51.261 --> 32:52.332
Huh?

32:53.138 --> 32:54.638
Sorry, I...

32:54.639 --> 32:55.639
- Oh god, here it comes again!
- Oh!

32:55.640 --> 32:58.642
- Help!
- Shhh!

32:58.643 --> 33:00.102
You'll wake the kids!

33:00.103 --> 33:01.312
Sara?

33:01.313 --> 33:03.147
Oh here, let me help you.

33:03.148 --> 33:05.149
Oh, you like that, don't you?

33:05.150 --> 33:07.348
Oh!

33:09.696 --> 33:15.944
Ooooh! You're incredible!

33:21.458 --> 33:24.251
Can you believe it?

33:24.252 --> 33:28.373
They call this the presidential
suite. What a joke.

33:30.675 --> 33:34.045
Ooooh.

33:45.524 --> 33:48.359
You're welcome to stay a while.

33:48.360 --> 33:51.445
My husband won't be
back 'til later.

33:51.446 --> 33:54.474
No, I think I'd better be going...

33:57.327 --> 33:59.070
Fuck.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.459
You know the princesses?

34:05.460 --> 34:07.378
They're high-priced courtesans.

34:07.379 --> 34:08.379
What?

34:08.380 --> 34:13.744
Rich Asian businessmen now pay
thousands for one in costume.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.425
You don't believe me?

34:23.728 --> 34:25.563
You're right.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.681
I'm joking.

34:31.069 --> 34:33.362
Well, uh...

34:33.362 --> 34:35.364
It was, um...

34:35.364 --> 34:38.563
- It was nice meeting you.
- Yeah.

34:39.077 --> 34:41.445
A real blast, wasn't it?

35:04.686 --> 35:06.963
Come on baby, let's go.

35:36.134 --> 35:39.428
- Em?
- Where's Mommy?

35:39.429 --> 35:41.502
I don't know.

35:54.152 --> 35:57.488
- Marco!
- Polo!

35:57.489 --> 36:01.860
- Marco!
- Polo!

36:05.372 --> 36:07.498
Marco!

36:07.499 --> 36:10.823
Marco!

36:11.670 --> 36:14.698
You gotta say Polo!

36:20.929 --> 36:24.640
Hey, you wanna swim
over and surprise 'em?

36:24.641 --> 36:26.225
Okay.

36:26.226 --> 36:30.130
- Marco!
- Polo!

36:37.195 --> 36:38.570
Marco!

36:38.571 --> 36:39.613
Hi Mommy!

36:39.614 --> 36:42.324
Oh! My goodness, Sara, is that you?

36:42.325 --> 36:44.068
Uh-huh!

36:44.744 --> 36:46.620
Elliot, look who it is!

36:46.621 --> 36:47.329
Where's Daddy?

36:47.330 --> 36:49.498
Over there!

36:49.499 --> 36:52.118
Oh! I see!

36:52.836 --> 36:54.878
- Did you have a good time?
- Yeah!

36:54.879 --> 36:57.122
Oh, good.

37:11.479 --> 37:13.981
Good.

37:13.982 --> 37:14.565
Hey guys!

37:14.566 --> 37:17.317
- Daddy!
- Hi.

37:17.318 --> 37:18.694
- Hey.
- How'd you find us?

37:18.695 --> 37:20.362
Oh, it was Sara, actually.

37:20.363 --> 37:22.239
She noticed your suits were gone.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.732
Oh! So smart!

37:24.492 --> 37:27.494
Yeah, it's crazy here today.

37:27.495 --> 37:30.873
I know, tell me about it.
This place is a mad house!

37:30.874 --> 37:32.875
Yeah, someone's looking
like they're better.

37:32.876 --> 37:34.251
Feeling better, huh?

37:34.252 --> 37:37.004
Yeah! We had a nap,
watched a movie.

37:37.005 --> 37:38.380
How was the park?

37:38.381 --> 37:40.674
It was uh... It was good.

37:40.675 --> 37:42.426
That's it? Just good?

37:42.427 --> 37:43.761
Yeah.

37:43.762 --> 37:46.881
Oh I got you something. Hold on.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.517
Is this the, uh...
Yeah, it's the one you wanted.

37:50.518 --> 37:51.810
Oh...

37:51.811 --> 37:52.644
What?

37:52.645 --> 37:54.688
- Dumbo, Jim?
- What's the matter?

37:54.689 --> 37:55.773
You got me Dumbo?

37:55.774 --> 37:57.399
Isn't that the one you wanted?

37:57.400 --> 38:01.767
Minnie Mouse, Jim. I said I wanted...
You know what? Never mind.

38:02.405 --> 38:03.530
- Hold it.
- What?

38:03.531 --> 38:05.407
Is she wearing sunscreen?

38:05.408 --> 38:07.367
What's the matter? You
mean from this morning?

38:07.368 --> 38:09.453
No, Jesus, Jim. You have
to reapply the sunblock

38:09.454 --> 38:11.955
before they go swimming.

38:11.956 --> 38:14.792
Sorry... I'm sorry.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.661
Watch Elliot.

38:18.421 --> 38:20.464
What happened to your knee?

38:20.465 --> 38:21.924
A boy pushed me.

38:21.925 --> 38:23.801
Oh! That's not very nice.

38:23.802 --> 38:26.830
- Yeah, he was mean.
- Oh!

38:27.806 --> 38:28.680
How long?

38:28.681 --> 38:29.973
That was super long.

38:29.974 --> 38:32.843
That was super duper long!

40:40.438 --> 40:42.431
Jim!

40:52.116 --> 40:53.312
Jim!

41:00.959 --> 41:02.451
What?

41:03.127 --> 41:05.671
You're not even watching Elliot.

41:05.672 --> 41:08.916
Come on, Em.

41:11.052 --> 41:14.456
- Are you crying?
- No.

41:17.976 --> 41:19.893
Ten minutes, then out.

41:19.894 --> 41:21.144
Ten minutes?

41:21.145 --> 41:23.647
Yeah, if you still wanna go to
Epcot and see the fireworks.

41:23.648 --> 41:27.067
We gotta change and get ready.
Why'd you put sunscreen on her, then?

41:27.068 --> 41:30.028
This is Florida, Jim.

41:30.029 --> 41:32.022
Ten minutes.

42:06.983 --> 42:08.150
What are you doin'?

42:08.151 --> 42:10.861
I'm fine. What are you doin'?

42:10.862 --> 42:13.196
I was just playin'.
What's going on?

42:13.197 --> 42:16.950
Hey, leave me alone! I'm fine,
I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm alive.

42:16.951 --> 42:20.230
I'm fine. Just kiddin' around.
Geez.

42:57.241 --> 42:59.576
I don't wanna take a bath!

42:59.577 --> 43:01.661
Sara, you come back here!
We've got to wash you up!

43:01.662 --> 43:02.746
Wash the chlorine off you.

43:02.747 --> 43:06.526
C'mon, we're gonna take a
bath and clean you up.

43:25.269 --> 43:28.092
Oh shit.

43:30.191 --> 43:33.026
- Perfect.
- Splash!

43:33.027 --> 43:35.028
Let's get you clean sweet pea!

43:35.029 --> 43:38.323
Splash splash!

43:38.324 --> 43:41.273
There you go. You are so clean now.

43:44.622 --> 43:47.624
This bathroom is gonna be a mess!

43:47.625 --> 43:51.128
Dry! Oh wait, there's
another spot right here.

43:51.129 --> 43:52.029
Ah!

43:53.172 --> 43:54.923
Fuck!

43:54.924 --> 43:57.543
Ow, shit.

44:01.180 --> 44:04.057
Let's go find Daddy.

44:04.058 --> 44:06.393
Let's go see what he's doing. okay?

44:06.394 --> 44:08.311
Does that sound good?

44:08.312 --> 44:09.688
Oh look!

44:09.689 --> 44:11.106
- Daddy!
- Hey!

44:11.107 --> 44:12.065
Did you find it?

44:12.066 --> 44:14.317
- What?
- The Geosporic!

44:14.318 --> 44:15.235
The Geospor... Yeah, yeah.

44:15.236 --> 44:19.266
It's right over there
I think. Hold on.

44:38.217 --> 44:43.418
Wow. It's a giant testicle.

44:47.226 --> 44:49.352
I don't like Epcot.

44:49.353 --> 44:52.105
- I wanna go on Buzz Lightyear.
- Elliot, look...

44:52.106 --> 44:54.357
- If you mention Buzz Lightyear one more time...
- Jim!

44:54.358 --> 44:56.109
Your father's not feeling well.

44:56.110 --> 44:57.694
Hey, you don't tell him that.

44:57.695 --> 44:59.362
Well, how about a
little consideration?

44:59.363 --> 45:01.948
- I want a balloon.
- She wants a balloon.

45:01.949 --> 45:04.075
Maybe later, sweetie.

45:04.076 --> 45:06.703
Okay, fine. Why don't we all
just go back to the hotel, okay?

45:06.704 --> 45:09.164
Is that what everyone wants?
That sound good?

45:09.165 --> 45:10.999
- Hey, hey!
- What?

45:11.000 --> 45:12.834
- Over there.
- What?

45:12.835 --> 45:14.878
That guy. That fat
guy on the scooter.

45:14.879 --> 45:17.130
His kid pushed down Sara.

45:17.131 --> 45:18.965
What the hell are they doing here?

45:18.966 --> 45:22.177
I don't know. They probably just
came to watch the fireworks.

45:22.178 --> 45:23.720
- What's the big deal?
- Shit!

45:23.721 --> 45:25.222
Don't swear in front
of the children!

45:25.223 --> 45:28.892
- What?
- Why are you acting so paranoid?

45:28.893 --> 45:33.514
- I'm not acting paranoid.
- Yes, you are! You're acting strange!

45:45.910 --> 45:47.327
One!

45:47.328 --> 45:50.038
Two!

45:50.039 --> 45:51.957
Eiffel Tower!

45:51.958 --> 45:53.750
Eiffel Tower!

45:53.751 --> 45:54.652
Yay!

45:56.379 --> 45:59.407
Cute! These are cute!

45:59.924 --> 46:03.802
Okay. Jim!

46:03.803 --> 46:05.470
Jim!

46:05.471 --> 46:07.623
Okay, wait!

46:10.434 --> 46:11.935
Hey Sara.

46:11.936 --> 46:13.770
Yabba dabba do. Yabba dabba do.

46:13.771 --> 46:14.938
- Come on.
- What?

46:14.939 --> 46:17.592
No, put it back. Come one.

46:19.026 --> 46:23.321
Look how pretty those are.

46:23.322 --> 46:24.114
They're so big.

46:24.115 --> 46:26.324
Look at the gold one.
I know, that gold one's good.

46:26.325 --> 46:28.727
Look at that one.
That's my favorite one.

46:35.293 --> 46:37.961
Yeah, thank you!

46:37.962 --> 46:39.212
- Thank you, frau!
- No, no.

46:39.213 --> 46:42.215
Don't give him anymore.
Honey. Enough, enough.

46:42.216 --> 46:44.342
No, no.

46:44.343 --> 46:45.665
Are we gonna fight now?

46:51.976 --> 46:55.471
Eins, zwei, drei!

46:59.317 --> 47:02.186
Yeah.

47:03.112 --> 47:05.447
Come on, no!
Jim, Jim, you've had...

47:05.448 --> 47:07.949
- No!
- You've had enough!

47:07.950 --> 47:09.951
Just let me have fun!
It's Disney World.

47:09.952 --> 47:13.322
Lighten up!

47:16.000 --> 47:18.001
Wunderbar!

47:18.002 --> 47:20.825
Deutschland forever!

47:23.215 --> 47:27.290
Babe, just for the kids.
Just for the kids.

47:27.386 --> 47:31.389
Smile big! Show me some teeth!

47:31.390 --> 47:35.185
This is for our mantle. Oh, cool.

47:35.186 --> 47:37.554
Bye!

47:38.230 --> 47:41.804
- Did you thank the princesses?
- Thank you!

47:44.028 --> 47:46.404
Do you wanna take your
picture little boy?

47:46.405 --> 47:49.866
Absolutely.

47:49.867 --> 47:53.271
Hi. Oh my goodness!

47:59.168 --> 48:01.336
Finally.

48:01.337 --> 48:06.591
Rich Asian businessmen, they'll
pay thousands for one in costume.

48:06.592 --> 48:10.053
Jim, Jim! Come on, Jim.

48:10.054 --> 48:12.222
It's time to go.
Jim, come back here.

48:12.223 --> 48:13.795
Lime margarita.

48:18.896 --> 48:20.438
- Hey guys!
- It goes over your head.

48:20.439 --> 48:23.191
- Hey baby.
- No, not now.

48:23.192 --> 48:24.567
- Come on.
- No, no.

48:24.568 --> 48:27.237
- What's with your mommy?
- No.

48:27.238 --> 48:28.571
All right, let's go. Come on.

48:28.572 --> 48:31.074
Mexico! Meh-hee-co, everybody.

48:31.075 --> 48:32.943
- Chop, chop!
- Jim!

48:41.961 --> 48:44.284
Sweet!

48:53.931 --> 48:55.958
"Fiesta hoy!"

49:11.365 --> 49:12.240
Jim!

49:12.241 --> 49:14.951
Leave me alone.

49:14.952 --> 49:16.619
What's wrong with Daddy?

49:16.620 --> 49:19.569
I don't know, babe. I don't know.

49:22.084 --> 49:23.960
Oh my gosh. You guys,
look over here.

49:23.961 --> 49:26.129
Look at the city. Come
on, look at Mexico City.

49:26.130 --> 49:27.770
It's so pretty, all the lights!

49:31.218 --> 49:34.721
Oh, Jim.

49:34.722 --> 49:37.098
Oh my God.

49:37.099 --> 49:40.673
Look at the fireworks, kids.
Look up at the fireworks.

49:42.396 --> 49:45.356
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

49:45.357 --> 49:48.727
I'm sorry.

50:07.755 --> 50:09.255
Come on, you guys. Stay close.

50:09.256 --> 50:12.626
Stay close.

50:39.286 --> 50:41.154
Hey.

50:42.164 --> 50:44.249
Come on, son. Let's go.

50:44.250 --> 50:47.073
- We're not washing hands?
- No.

51:21.495 --> 51:25.290
Oh.

51:25.291 --> 51:27.333
What happened?!

51:27.334 --> 51:29.532
Nothing.

51:29.587 --> 51:30.461
Hey!

51:30.462 --> 51:34.340
How is that little
darlin' of yours?

51:34.341 --> 51:36.467
Now, I sure did like her.

51:36.468 --> 51:39.121
Oh! Oh Lordy!

51:45.603 --> 51:48.313
Jim? Oh my God!

51:48.314 --> 51:51.441
Elliot, Sara. Come on, let's go.
Come on, hurry.

51:51.442 --> 51:53.776
- Jim, your shirt... it's ripped.
- I know, I know.

51:53.777 --> 51:56.521
Okay, let's go. Chop, chop.

51:57.406 --> 51:58.364
Come on.

51:58.365 --> 52:00.813
Slow down, Jim.

52:03.621 --> 52:05.705
- Excuse us.
- Jim.

52:05.706 --> 52:07.123
Come on, guys. Come on.

52:07.124 --> 52:09.459
Slow down. Jim, slow down!

52:09.460 --> 52:10.501
Wait!

52:10.502 --> 52:13.075
What?!

52:14.131 --> 52:17.133
There's... there's
something going's on here.

52:17.134 --> 52:20.637
- Huh?
- It's this place!

52:20.638 --> 52:23.139
What? I don't understand.

52:23.140 --> 52:27.761
You told Elliot I look
like Emily Dickinson?

52:28.479 --> 52:31.481
- I like Emily Dickinson.
- God!

52:31.482 --> 52:35.151
They're a little young, Jim...

52:35.152 --> 52:37.975
even for you. Don't you think?

52:39.907 --> 52:40.531
- Who?
- Who?!

52:40.532 --> 52:44.410
- Who?!
- Yeah, who?

52:44.411 --> 52:47.538
Those Parisian chicks...
or whatever they are!

52:47.539 --> 52:49.165
- Okay, just calm down.
- Don't touch me!

52:49.166 --> 52:51.417
- People are watching.
- Had the sudden urge to learn French?!

52:51.418 --> 52:53.670
Don't give me that look.
I saw you at the pool.

52:53.671 --> 52:56.172
I'm not a total idiot.

52:56.173 --> 52:59.425
You've probably been following
them all day, haven't you?

52:59.426 --> 53:00.827
Following who?

53:02.471 --> 53:04.472
Who was on the phone this morning?

53:04.473 --> 53:07.547
- What?!
- Who were you talking to?

53:09.561 --> 53:12.840
I lost my job.

53:17.569 --> 53:19.612
Elliot, Sara! Come on, we're going.

53:19.613 --> 53:21.698
Emily, wait!

53:21.699 --> 53:23.950
- Can I get this?
- No. No one's getting anything.

53:23.951 --> 53:26.577
Put it back. Elliot, you too.
Wait, Em. What about the fireworks?

53:26.578 --> 53:30.456
I've seen enough for one day.
This vacation's over.

53:30.457 --> 53:32.583
- How 'bout just this?
- No.

53:32.584 --> 53:35.503
Elliot, you wanna go
on Spaceship Earth?

53:35.504 --> 53:37.588
- Elliot, what's wrong?
- He doesn't trust you.

53:37.589 --> 53:40.800
- Not that I blame him.
- That boy has one!

53:40.801 --> 53:41.926
I don't care.

53:41.927 --> 53:43.469
Hey, Sara. Lemme take Sara.

53:43.470 --> 53:45.596
- No, you're drunk.
- No, I'm not.

53:45.597 --> 53:48.725
- But I really want it!
- Goddammit Sara! I said put it back!

53:48.726 --> 53:51.728
No!
God!

53:51.729 --> 53:53.881
Oh my God.

53:58.777 --> 54:02.852
Just... just take her.

54:04.324 --> 54:06.576
It's okay, honey.
Mommy didn't mean that.

54:06.577 --> 54:09.370
Mommy didn't mean that,
sweetie... it's okay.

54:09.371 --> 54:10.747
Don't cry baby. It's all right.

54:10.748 --> 54:14.417
Mommy didn't mean that.
It's okay.

54:14.418 --> 54:17.788
She didn't... She doesn't
usually act like that.

54:32.269 --> 54:33.966
Come on.

54:49.536 --> 54:52.538
Mommy didn't mean
to do that, honey.

54:52.539 --> 54:56.709
She's didn't mean to do that.
She just got angry, okay?

54:56.710 --> 55:01.160
Look at me. There you go.

56:12.911 --> 56:16.539
Jim. Where are you, Jim?

56:16.540 --> 56:19.489
I've been waiting for you.

56:25.924 --> 56:28.384
I have something to tell you, Jim.

56:28.385 --> 56:30.761
Soon, Jim. You'll be mine.

56:30.762 --> 56:35.212
You'll be all mine.

58:30.632 --> 58:32.955
Holy crap!

58:52.529 --> 58:54.655
Come with us.

58:54.656 --> 58:55.865
You speak English?

58:55.866 --> 58:59.065
Please... come.

59:01.204 --> 59:03.247
No.

59:03.248 --> 59:05.525
You won't?

59:05.876 --> 59:08.529
I can't.

59:10.714 --> 59:12.923
Why not?

59:12.924 --> 59:16.135
Well, I'm afraid that
if I come with you...

59:16.136 --> 59:18.846
something bad is gonna happen.

59:18.847 --> 59:23.502
But if you don't, something will.

59:26.730 --> 59:29.231
No, I'm sorry.

59:29.232 --> 59:32.306
You must come.

59:34.071 --> 59:37.190
No, I... No.

59:38.825 --> 59:44.038
You are sure of this?

59:44.039 --> 59:45.247
Yeah.

59:45.248 --> 59:48.334
Then, I am sorry too.

59:48.335 --> 59:49.611
For what?

01:00:23.995 --> 01:00:27.365
Sara. Sara?

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:30.239
Sara!

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:37.208
Sara!

01:00:40.971 --> 01:00:43.180
Hey!

01:00:43.181 --> 01:00:45.766
- Hey!
- Jim White?

01:00:45.767 --> 01:00:46.668
Yeah?

01:00:47.185 --> 01:00:49.178
What are you doing?

01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:34.690
Your father took you
here as a child.

01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:36.358
- Am I correct?
- Huh?

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:40.362
That must have been right around
the time this park opened?

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:43.032
Interesting.

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:45.242
Where am I? Where's Sara?

01:01:45.243 --> 01:01:47.995
Consider yourself very
fortunate, Mr. White.

01:01:47.996 --> 01:01:51.707
No outsider has ever been where you are.
That makes you the first.

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:52.917
The first?

01:01:52.918 --> 01:01:57.713
Yes, and right now you're under
the ride Spaceship Earth.

01:01:57.714 --> 01:02:00.007
What we call Base 21.

01:02:00.008 --> 01:02:04.386
- I'm still at Epcot?
- But where else?

01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:06.847
Oh, I must apologize for those.

01:02:06.848 --> 01:02:10.309
But, you see, I had no idea what
sort of condition you'd be in.

01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:12.728
It's been so long.

01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:16.232
Who are you?

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:18.400
Consider me a friend.

01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:19.902
You work for Dny?

01:02:19.903 --> 01:02:24.990
No, and fortunately for you, they
are unaware of my existence.

01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:29.161
Unless, of course, the French take...
Oh, they are the most dangerous.

01:02:29.162 --> 01:02:32.206
You see, I am a servant of
the Siemens Corporation.

01:02:32.207 --> 01:02:33.916
What?!

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:35.042
Siemens.

01:02:35.043 --> 01:02:39.323
The enterprise which
sponsors this attraction.

01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:54.842
Computer, begin the scan.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:05.348
You've got quite an imagination!

01:03:05.949 --> 01:03:09.785
Just like old W himself.

01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:11.161
He died...

01:03:11.162 --> 01:03:15.157
while all this was still
in its early stages.

01:03:16.001 --> 01:03:19.795
Epcot's real purpose
remains unfinished.

01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:21.839
You're inside my head!

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:26.093
Not your head, Jim.
In your imagination.

01:03:26.094 --> 01:03:28.804
But we don't want to
control it like they do.

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:31.390
We simply monitor things,

01:03:31.391 --> 01:03:34.340
so we can know what they're
up to and keep tabs.

01:03:36.563 --> 01:03:38.105
Who is that?

01:03:38.106 --> 01:03:39.982
That's you.

01:03:39.983 --> 01:03:41.483
What?!

01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:43.235
Only that's the real you,

01:03:43.236 --> 01:03:46.989
in a part of your imagination
you've never sought to use.

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:49.116
Turn it off, please! Please!

01:03:49.117 --> 01:03:51.861
Somethings not right.

01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:58.959
Didn't your boss relay the
message when you spoke to him?

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:02.212
My boss? What are
you talking about?

01:04:02.213 --> 01:04:03.839
He was instructed to remind you...

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.507
you were to take the boy.

01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:09.511
And Security was to meet you, after
the ride, at the Land Pavilion.

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:13.432
Do you know how much
depends on this?!

01:04:13.433 --> 01:04:17.102
We even had to shut down
the Buzz Lightyear!

01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:19.881
Excuse me for a moment.

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:36.238
Geosporic.

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:40.568
Oh, yeah, yeah, it's over there.

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:38.801
Jim?

01:05:43.356 --> 01:05:45.649
Holy crap!

01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:48.193
You're a robot.

01:05:48.194 --> 01:05:52.474
I was trying to help you...

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:17.014
- Yeah?
- Jim, listen to me.

01:06:17.015 --> 01:06:18.974
- Don't let your imagination run wild.
- What did you do with her?!

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:21.560
It's a transitional period.

01:06:21.561 --> 01:06:22.728
Just tell me where she is!

01:06:22.729 --> 01:06:25.522
I can't really discuss
it right now.

01:06:25.523 --> 01:06:28.066
Come on, you son of a bitch!
Sorry old boy. I'm just a messenger.

01:06:28.067 --> 01:06:29.693
Where are you?! Goddammit you!

01:06:29.694 --> 01:06:34.065
- Best of luck!
- Wait, no!

01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:53.493
Sorry. Sorry.

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:12.394
Sara?

01:07:18.409 --> 01:07:19.576
Run faster.

01:07:19.577 --> 01:07:22.651
Sara, is that you?!

01:07:26.334 --> 01:07:29.408
Sweetie, honey, where are you?

01:07:35.677 --> 01:07:37.386
You can't get me.

01:07:37.387 --> 01:07:39.755
Sara?

01:07:59.117 --> 01:08:01.110
Over here!

01:08:28.395 --> 01:08:30.844
Jim!

01:08:36.154 --> 01:08:38.180
Get off my dad! Someone help!

01:08:39.698 --> 01:08:42.117
What's wrong with you Mr?!

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:44.786
You made me... drop my turkey leg!

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:45.787
- It's emu!
- Huh?

01:08:45.787 --> 01:08:50.193
Oh Christ.

01:10:15.878 --> 01:10:18.246
Sara, thank God.

01:10:20.758 --> 01:10:22.634
Huh?

01:10:22.635 --> 01:10:26.346
Okay, we're almost ready!

01:10:26.347 --> 01:10:28.340
Where is she?

01:10:29.809 --> 01:10:31.893
What's going on?

01:10:31.894 --> 01:10:33.895
How did you get in here?

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:36.648
- Why are you dressed like that?
- What do you mean?

01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:38.775
- You took her didn't you?
- Benji, come here!

01:10:38.776 --> 01:10:41.528
Sorry, I really have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:10:41.529 --> 01:10:42.529
If you even touched her!

01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:45.782
Okay, now you're starting to scare me.
I think you should leave before...

01:10:45.783 --> 01:10:47.951
- Before what?
- Before my husband gets back.

01:10:47.952 --> 01:10:48.952
Husband?!

01:10:48.953 --> 01:10:51.496
- You're not even married, are you?
- Get out!

01:10:51.497 --> 01:10:54.696
- What's in the bedroom?
- I'm warning you!

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:08.263
Sara.

01:11:08.264 --> 01:11:11.258
Oh, God!

01:11:15.521 --> 01:11:17.439
You're okay?

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:19.900
Hi, Daddy.

01:11:19.901 --> 01:11:22.527
- That was fun!
- Fun?

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:24.446
Un-huh. Can we do it again?

01:11:24.447 --> 01:11:26.281
- Again?!
- Sorry, sweetie.

01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:28.742
I don't think your dad
would like it too much.

01:11:28.743 --> 01:11:30.285
But I'm Still thirsty!

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:34.289
- Did she give you something?
- Relax, it's just sparkling apple juice.

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:37.459
It's just pretend.

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:38.710
Are you out of your mind?

01:11:38.711 --> 01:11:42.631
- You don't just take someone's kid.
- I always bring them back.

01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:44.966
- Bring them back?
- Some people don't even notice.

01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:45.967
Jesus Christ.

01:11:45.968 --> 01:11:49.846
Wait! Jim, wait!

01:11:49.847 --> 01:11:52.090
Have you even seen
someone decapitated?

01:11:52.934 --> 01:11:56.338
- What?
- It's not like in the movies.

01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:08.865
That's a pretty dress.

01:12:08.866 --> 01:12:11.326
It happens here, occasionally.

01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:13.354
Last time on Thunder Mountain.

01:12:14.038 --> 01:12:16.039
I can't feel my teeth.

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:18.750
People just come here 'cos
they wanna feel safe.

01:12:18.751 --> 01:12:20.243
They're afraid!

01:12:21.546 --> 01:12:24.339
But you can't escape it, you know.

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:26.959
Bad things happen everywhere.

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:29.845
Especially here.

01:12:29.846 --> 01:12:31.763
- You're a witch.
- No!

01:12:31.764 --> 01:12:35.517
I'm a princess. Or at
least, I used to be.

01:12:35.518 --> 01:12:38.895
Happy day all of you! I love you!

01:12:38.896 --> 01:12:42.607
I'm so happy to be here with you!

01:12:42.608 --> 01:12:44.734
My beautiful princes
and princesses!

01:12:44.735 --> 01:12:47.863
Hello, Princess Minnie,
you beautiful angel.

01:12:47.864 --> 01:12:49.865
Keep smiling.

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:53.869
Another beautiful princess.
Hello darling.

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:57.080
I used to be one of
them a long time ago.

01:12:57.081 --> 01:13:01.042
Back when I was young
and beautiful.

01:13:01.043 --> 01:13:04.754
And it was magical.

01:13:04.755 --> 01:13:07.883
'Til one day I saw
this little girl.

01:13:07.884 --> 01:13:11.052
She was so perfect,
like your daughter.

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:13.513
Like Sara?

01:13:13.514 --> 01:13:16.725
So I wrapped my arms around her.

01:13:16.726 --> 01:13:19.060
But then something happened.

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:22.397
When you're a princess,
they teach you to smile.

01:13:22.398 --> 01:13:27.652
Be cheery, merry, jovial.
And you can never be sad.

01:13:27.653 --> 01:13:30.655
Never ever!

01:13:30.656 --> 01:13:33.617
Then something happened.
I couldn't let go.

01:13:33.618 --> 01:13:35.911
Help! I can't breathe!

01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:39.915
Oh no, princesses must never cry!

01:13:39.916 --> 01:13:41.416
Hey, what are you doing
to my daughter?!

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:42.709
- Let go of her!
- Stop it!

01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:45.420
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Let her go!

01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:48.548
But you can't be
happy all the time.

01:13:48.549 --> 01:13:51.793
It's just not possible.

01:13:52.553 --> 01:13:57.959
And you know smiling's not
good... for the wrinkles.

01:14:01.687 --> 01:14:04.940
And I hate happy endings.

01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:07.525
Hate's a bad word!

01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:10.145
That's mine!

01:14:11.656 --> 01:14:13.823
You're sick, you know that?!

01:14:13.824 --> 01:14:16.451
Haven't you ever had
a fantasy, Jim?

01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:17.953
Daddy, let's go home.

01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:19.955
Thank you for playing
with me, Sara.

01:14:19.956 --> 01:14:22.082
You're a very sweet little girl.

01:14:22.083 --> 01:14:25.585
- Like a princess?
- Yes, darling... wait!

01:14:25.586 --> 01:14:27.963
Your balloon!

01:14:27.964 --> 01:14:29.839
- You don't want to forget it.
- Look daddy!

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:33.835
Goodbye, Jim!

01:14:36.097 --> 01:14:38.682
We welcome you aboard
our highway in the sky.

01:14:38.683 --> 01:14:40.016
And hope you've enjoyed
the Magic Kingdom.

01:14:40.017 --> 01:14:43.019
We're traveling to Disney's
contemporary resort.

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:46.982
During our travels, please
hold onto the handrails

01:14:46.983 --> 01:14:48.543
and stay clear of the door...

01:15:46.625 --> 01:15:48.209
I love you. You know that?

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:50.453
Uh-huh.

01:17:43.325 --> 01:17:46.274
What?

01:18:06.724 --> 01:18:09.851
Everyone's so worried
about cat flu now.

01:18:09.852 --> 01:18:13.506
You can be a host and
not even know it.

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:19.724
Cat flu...

01:18:39.965 --> 01:18:42.050
Vitamin C...

01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:43.885
Vitamin C.

01:18:43.886 --> 01:18:44.786
Vitamin C...

01:18:56.398 --> 01:18:58.596
Ugh.

01:19:20.089 --> 01:19:22.708
Elliot.

01:19:23.926 --> 01:19:26.749
I'm sick.

01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:29.055
I need help.

01:19:29.056 --> 01:19:32.300
Help.

01:19:33.102 --> 01:19:35.470
Elliot.

01:20:22.234 --> 01:20:25.433
You've got quite an imagination!

01:20:27.281 --> 01:20:30.434
Just like old W himself.

01:20:31.285 --> 01:20:35.406
He died while all this was
still in its early stages.

01:21:11.325 --> 01:21:13.398
Ah. Ah!

01:21:30.594 --> 01:21:32.587
How much time?

01:21:35.516 --> 01:21:37.884
We're on the floor now.

01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:07.508
Seven... six... five...
four... three... two... one!

01:26:34.648 --> 01:26:36.190
Checking in, or...?

01:26:36.191 --> 01:26:38.639
That we are.

01:26:54.292 --> 01:26:55.793
Allow me to help you
with your luggage.

01:26:55.794 --> 01:26:57.662
Thank you.
