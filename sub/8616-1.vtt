WEBVTT

01:45.488 --> 01:49.450
46-99402.

01:49.700 --> 01:55.498
Transfer to 53-01138.

02:00.211 --> 02:01.337
What'd we just do?

02:01.587 --> 02:04.757
The Republican Party just made
a donation to the Black Panthers.

02:05.007 --> 02:07.427
- Farm out.
- Right arm.

02:07.677 --> 02:10.847
- Who's next?
- Let's see.

02:11.097 --> 02:14.350
Richard Nixon's personal checking account
is in here.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.352
This is a challenge.

02:16.602 --> 02:20.106
Marty, we have to find somebody
truly worthy to give his money to.

02:20.356 --> 02:24.777
How about the National Association
to Legalize Marijuana?

02:25.027 --> 02:26.779
Perfect. How much should he give?

02:27.029 --> 02:30.825
He's a generous man. I'd say,
all he's got. God, I'm hungry!

02:31.075 --> 02:32.910
Marty...

02:33.161 --> 02:35.913
you're sure we will not
get into trouble for this?

02:36.164 --> 02:40.543
Cosmo, trust me.

02:46.841 --> 02:49.552
Posit: The phone company
has too much money.

02:49.802 --> 02:51.888
- Good one.
- Consequence?

02:52.138 --> 02:53.389
They're corrupt. Result?

02:53.639 --> 02:56.809
The system perpetuates itself
at the expense of the people.

02:57.059 --> 03:01.063
- Conclusion?
- Ma Bell needs to donate some money.

03:01.314 --> 03:03.149
We're gonna change the world.

03:03.399 --> 03:07.487
I just wish we could get course credit
for this. Gosh!

03:07.737 --> 03:11.282
You gotta eat. You want some food?

03:11.532 --> 03:14.452
Loser goes.

03:14.494 --> 03:17.663
I never lose.

03:21.626 --> 03:25.129
Pepperoni pizza, please.
Shaken, not stirred.

03:25.379 --> 03:30.093
- Power to the people, Cos.
- Power to the people, Marty.

03:32.053 --> 03:36.265
One cannot trust anybody these days.

04:13.719 --> 04:17.557
No, don't do this.

04:56.095 --> 04:59.474
Marty! Marty!

05:16.741 --> 05:18.743
Martin.

05:18.993 --> 05:22.371
Martin.

05:31.172 --> 05:34.133
It's time.

05:35.593 --> 05:36.761
How're we doing?

05:37.011 --> 05:40.932
Carl's in position on the fire escape.
Mother's in the cable vault.

05:41.182 --> 05:45.186
Whistler is reading.

05:51.317 --> 05:53.194
We're up.

05:53.444 --> 05:54.862
What's with the lobby?

05:55.113 --> 05:57.782
Still just the one guard.

05:58.032 --> 06:02.662
Okay, Mother,
try the ones coming off the blue trunk.

06:05.998 --> 06:08.042
Nope.

06:08.292 --> 06:13.256
Try the ones coming off the white trunk.
These don't sound right.

06:15.550 --> 06:17.343
<i>Hold on.</i>

06:17.593 --> 06:20.221
We even have photos
of the guy leaving the embassy...

06:20.471 --> 06:22.723
through the back service entrance.

06:22.974 --> 06:26.477
Hey, Crease, you on?

06:26.769 --> 06:27.812
Yeah, I'm on.

06:28.062 --> 06:31.274
<i>Were you still in the CIA in '72?</i>

06:31.524 --> 06:32.525
Yeah, why?

06:32.775 --> 06:34.735
Did you know the Deputy
Director of Planning...

06:34.986 --> 06:39.031
was in Managua, Nicaragua,
the day before the earthquake?

06:39.282 --> 06:42.660
What are you saying?
The CIA caused the Managua earthquake?

06:42.910 --> 06:46.873
I can't prove it, but...

06:47.206 --> 06:50.710
I can't talk to that guy.

06:51.461 --> 06:55.006
Hold on, Mother. Go back one.

06:55.339 --> 06:56.841
Bingo!

06:57.091 --> 07:01.012
Securing bridge clips.

07:02.096 --> 07:05.099
Preparing to sever master alarm circuit.

07:05.349 --> 07:07.602
Five, four...

07:07.852 --> 07:11.689
<i>I looked in that box just now.</i>

07:11.939 --> 07:15.401
<i>There wasn't anything there.</i>

07:54.941 --> 07:56.109
Nice bank?

07:56.359 --> 08:01.531
You wouldn't believe what I had to do
to get a safe deposit box.

08:32.437 --> 08:36.982
Shit. We're gettin' too old for this.

08:38.734 --> 08:41.863
<i>- Westguard Security.
- Yeah, I got a fire at Centurion Bank.</i>

08:42.113 --> 08:47.243
<i>We got the alarm. Are there any
secondary indications? Smoke or flame?</i>

08:47.493 --> 08:48.536
No.

08:48.786 --> 08:52.165
<i>Probably a false alarm. We've been
getting them in your area all night.</i>

08:52.415 --> 08:56.711
<i>- See if it resets.
- Man, I don't know.</i>

09:04.594 --> 09:10.558
- Sure you know which one to cut?
- Yes! The alarm's always the green one.

09:10.933 --> 09:12.518
Good, Carl.

09:12.769 --> 09:17.231
I'm not waitin' any longer.
I'm callin' the fire...

09:19.192 --> 09:22.528
It stopped. Sorry.

09:22.779 --> 09:27.241
<i>- No problem. And, son?
- Sir?</i>

09:27.784 --> 09:31.287
<i>- Good work.
- Thank you, sir.</i>

09:33.039 --> 09:35.750
All yours, Bish.

09:44.592 --> 09:49.055
So, how much do you want?

09:49.138 --> 09:53.184
$80,000, $90,000, $100,000.

09:53.434 --> 09:54.727
Okay.

09:54.977 --> 09:58.189
May I ask why you're closing
your account with us today, sir?

09:58.439 --> 10:04.529
I just had this weird feeling
that my money wasn't safe here anymore.

10:22.422 --> 10:26.634
Gentlemen, your communication lines
are vulnerable.

10:26.884 --> 10:28.719
Fire exits need to be monitored.

10:28.970 --> 10:31.305
Your rent-a-cops are a tad undertrained.

10:31.556 --> 10:33.683
Outside of that,
everything seems to be fine.

10:33.933 --> 10:39.564
You'll get our full report in a few days.
But first, who's got my check?

10:39.599 --> 10:43.651
So, people hire you
to break into their places...

10:43.901 --> 10:49.031
to make sure no one
can break into their places?

10:49.115 --> 10:52.034
It's a living.

10:52.952 --> 10:55.538
Not a very good one.

10:55.788 --> 10:58.958
Thank you.

11:04.297 --> 11:05.381
Is that him?

11:05.631 --> 11:08.760
Yeah, that's him.

11:14.015 --> 11:16.100
Who's got the report for the bank sneak?

11:16.350 --> 11:18.936
- I'm gonna type it up later.
- You are?

11:19.187 --> 11:22.231
We haven't paid the typist since January,
so it's me or Whistler.

11:22.482 --> 11:25.193
- Better Whistler.
- We've got customers.

11:25.443 --> 11:29.071
- Shoes?
- Expensive.

11:29.363 --> 11:32.575
Look busy, guys.

11:33.993 --> 11:35.453
- Mr. Bishop. Dick Gordon.
- Hi.

11:35.703 --> 11:37.455
- Buddy Wallace.
- Hi.

11:37.705 --> 11:40.833
- We've heard great things about you.
- They're all true.

11:41.083 --> 11:42.083
Thanks, Carl.

11:42.251 --> 11:47.048
Let's go to the conference room.
You can tell us how we can help.

11:51.010 --> 11:54.222
- Okay.
- Thank you.

11:55.473 --> 11:58.559
- So here...
- Before we begin...

11:58.810 --> 12:01.312
there's something we'd like to clear up.

12:01.562 --> 12:05.525
Most firms of this type are staffed
with ex-law enforcement types.

12:05.775 --> 12:07.485
But your team...

12:07.735 --> 12:11.906
- I know, kind of different.
- Yes, you are.

12:16.202 --> 12:20.748
Darren Roskow, also known as "Mother".

12:20.998 --> 12:23.584
Eighteen months at Dannemora
for breaking and entering.

12:23.835 --> 12:28.506
Yeah, he was framed. But he's got
the best hands in the business.

12:28.756 --> 12:31.050
Carl Arbogast, age 19.

12:31.300 --> 12:35.805
Caught breaking into the Oakland School
District computer to change his grades.

12:36.055 --> 12:38.349
I know. We're the ones who caught him.

12:38.599 --> 12:41.644
Irwin Emery, also known as "Whistler".

12:41.894 --> 12:45.022
He had some little problem
with the phone company.

12:45.273 --> 12:47.316
Sixty-two counts?

12:47.567 --> 12:49.110
You want law enforcement?

12:49.360 --> 12:52.280
How about Donald Crease?
Twenty-two year veteran of the CIA.

12:52.530 --> 12:57.118
Terminated, 1987. Why was that?

12:57.368 --> 13:00.246
I don't know. I think a personality
conflict. Who are you?

13:00.496 --> 13:02.540
Relax, Marty.
We have to check these things.

13:02.790 --> 13:05.960
Everybody on your team has had
some sort of problem in their past.

13:06.210 --> 13:09.589
And then there's Martin Bishop.

13:12.091 --> 13:15.678
He doesn't seem to have a past.

13:16.971 --> 13:20.141
Sorry to waste your time.
I don't work for the government.

13:20.391 --> 13:22.977
We know.

13:24.270 --> 13:27.565
National Security Agency.

13:28.316 --> 13:31.235
You're the guys I hear breathing
on the other end of my phone.

13:31.486 --> 13:33.112
No, that's the FBI.

13:33.362 --> 13:35.490
We're not chartered
for domestic surveillance.

13:35.740 --> 13:39.744
I see. You just overthrow governments,
set up friendly dictators.

13:39.994 --> 13:41.454
No, that's the CIA.

13:41.704 --> 13:45.333
We protect government communications,
try to break the other fellow's codes.

13:45.583 --> 13:46.876
We're the good guys, Marty.

13:47.126 --> 13:50.338
I can't tell you what a
relief that is, Dick.

13:50.588 --> 13:53.341
All right, that's enough.

13:53.591 --> 13:55.176
Let's go.

13:55.426 --> 13:58.763
If you change your mind...

13:58.971 --> 14:02.475
call us at this number...

14:02.683 --> 14:05.436
Mr. Brice.

14:40.847 --> 14:43.724
Help me out?

14:43.975 --> 14:46.352
Spare a quarter? Help me out.

14:46.602 --> 14:48.771
The government's taken away my home.

14:49.021 --> 14:52.567
Talk to him.

14:58.781 --> 15:02.493
Well, if it isn't Robin Hood.

15:02.743 --> 15:08.082
I could've joined the NSA, but
they found out my parents were married.

15:08.332 --> 15:12.003
We're all friends here, right? Easy, easy.

15:12.253 --> 15:16.007
- Want some coffee or something?
- No.

15:16.466 --> 15:20.094
- Buddy, is that Janek's file?
- Yeah, Janek's file.

15:20.344 --> 15:22.555
This is a mathematician
named Dr. Gunter Janek.

15:22.805 --> 15:25.057
Works at a think tank called
the Coolidge Institute.

15:25.308 --> 15:28.478
Specializes in large-number theory,
prime numbers, factoring.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.271
- Cryptography.
- Very good.

15:30.521 --> 15:33.566
Last month, the good doctor
gets a grant, $380,000.

15:33.816 --> 15:35.651
Way out of profile for a guy like that.

15:35.902 --> 15:39.781
It's our job to be curious, so we traced
the money. Guess where it comes from?

15:40.031 --> 15:42.158
- I know you're not gonna say Russia.
- Yeah.

15:42.408 --> 15:43.785
Give me a break.

15:44.035 --> 15:46.579
We won, they lost.
It's been in a couple of papers.

15:46.829 --> 15:48.956
We still spy on them. They still spy on us.

15:49.207 --> 15:51.292
We intercepted a fax last week. Here.

15:51.542 --> 15:54.796
He's making some kind of box,
a little black box.

15:55.046 --> 15:58.800
The project's called Setec Astronomy.
We don't know what Setec stands for.

15:59.050 --> 16:01.344
- Security technology...
- Sensor techniques, who knows?

16:01.594 --> 16:05.556
It may be nothing or it may be something.
And we need to know.

16:05.807 --> 16:09.769
Your job is to find that little black box.
Let us take a look at it.

16:10.019 --> 16:11.229
No way.

16:11.479 --> 16:13.022
Sorry, Marty.

16:13.272 --> 16:16.734
We don't have a lot of choice here.

16:16.984 --> 16:18.361
- Do it yourself.
- We can't.

16:18.611 --> 16:21.239
By law, we're not allowed
to do this kind of operation.

16:21.489 --> 16:23.407
Then get the FBI.

16:23.658 --> 16:25.493
Yeah, right, the FBI.

16:25.743 --> 16:29.330
The FBI can't work for us without approval
from a congressional committee.

16:29.580 --> 16:31.457
- We don't have the time.
- So why me?

16:31.707 --> 16:35.586
- Frankly, because we...
- Yeah, frankly.

16:35.795 --> 16:39.048
Marty, sit down, please.

16:40.216 --> 16:42.593
Frankly, because it's kind of illegal.

16:42.844 --> 16:46.556
You've stayed underground more than 20
years. You know how not to get caught.

16:46.806 --> 16:51.144
- We know you can keep your mouth shut.
- Job pays $175,000, payable on delivery.

16:51.394 --> 16:55.857
You can distribute it among the poor,
if you like.

16:56.357 --> 16:58.109
- Pass.
- We also clean up your record.

16:58.359 --> 17:00.486
Quash the outstanding warrant
for your arrest.

17:00.736 --> 17:02.405
Your pal Cosmo got 12 years.

17:02.655 --> 17:04.656
That was without flight
to evade prosecution.

17:04.906 --> 17:08.994
We all know what happened
to him in there.

17:11.497 --> 17:14.541
If I say no?

17:15.126 --> 17:17.252
Don't say no.

17:17.502 --> 17:21.549
What good would you do anybody
in prison?

17:22.633 --> 17:25.928
I don't believe this.
You lied to us all these years.

17:26.179 --> 17:28.306
- Even lied to us about your name.
- Sorry, okay?

17:28.556 --> 17:33.144
I'm sorry, but when you're wanted by the
feds, you don't go telling everybody.

17:33.394 --> 17:36.647
We're not everybody, Martin,
we're your partners. You tell us.

17:36.898 --> 17:42.153
Fine. Exactly why was it
you had to leave the CIA?

17:44.280 --> 17:46.949
We all have our little secrets, don't we?

17:47.200 --> 17:49.619
Look, you guys have a decision to make.

17:49.869 --> 17:51.287
This is not a test.

17:51.537 --> 17:54.832
The penetration is live,
the target is unaware.

17:55.082 --> 17:58.920
Sneaking a foreign intelligence service
that might kill us is not what we do.

17:59.170 --> 18:03.049
The probable level of security is very low.

18:03.299 --> 18:07.095
But if you guys don't want to take
that chance just to keep me out of jail...

18:07.345 --> 18:10.223
fine, I understand, don't do it.

18:10.473 --> 18:14.519
Well, Bish, I can't speak for the other
guys, but I'm in it for the money.

18:14.769 --> 18:18.189
- I don't care if you go to jail.
- Me neither. I'm in.

18:18.439 --> 18:22.485
Could we maybe just go back
to the "they might kill us" part?

18:22.735 --> 18:26.531
If I thought that was likely, I wouldn't
bring this to you. But there is a risk.

18:26.781 --> 18:30.910
It pays $175,000!

18:31.619 --> 18:34.163
I'm in.

18:37.458 --> 18:39.961
You guys'll be chalk outlines without me.

18:40.211 --> 18:43.089
All right, what do we need?

18:43.339 --> 18:45.591
We start with a very light surveillance.

18:45.842 --> 18:48.386
Level three. First sign of baby-sitters,
we back off.

18:48.636 --> 18:50.805
He's giving a lecture tomorrow at U.C.

18:51.055 --> 18:55.309
I'm gonna be there and check him out.
Okay? Any questions?

18:55.560 --> 18:56.560
Let's do it.

18:56.644 --> 19:00.273
For the lecture, you want
to take Whistler or do you want me?

19:00.523 --> 19:05.570
No, that's okay, I thought I'd ask Liz.

19:47.653 --> 19:49.405
Who's this?

19:49.655 --> 19:52.825
Sort of an old friend.

19:53.034 --> 19:56.788
Practice! Practice, practice!

20:00.666 --> 20:03.461
- Hi.
- We're not getting back together.

20:03.711 --> 20:05.338
- Did I say anything?
- You will.

20:05.588 --> 20:07.090
I'm here on business, Liz.

20:07.340 --> 20:11.427
Bishop, you don't have a business,
you have a club. It's a boy's club.

20:11.677 --> 20:14.472
You have a clubhouse,
you probably have a secret handshake.

20:14.722 --> 20:16.265
Liz, I need your help.

20:16.516 --> 20:19.102
I will not be dragged back into your world.

20:19.352 --> 20:23.940
I have a new group of gifted children,
and I like the fact they're under 30.

20:24.190 --> 20:25.274
Excuse me.

20:25.525 --> 20:28.486
There's a mathematician named
Gunter Janek. You know him?

20:28.736 --> 20:30.154
I've read him. Now go away.

20:30.404 --> 20:34.659
- He's giving a master lecture at 3:30...
- How nice for him.

20:34.909 --> 20:38.037
- I thought I'd buy you dinner after.
- I am not going out with you.

20:38.287 --> 20:42.375
This isn't a date, dummy. This is a
scientific exploration, a tutorial.

20:42.625 --> 20:45.420
I need you...

20:46.337 --> 20:49.590
to explain it to me.

20:50.925 --> 20:53.678
Read a book.

20:53.803 --> 20:56.848
They found me, Liz.

20:57.181 --> 20:59.934
The government found me.

21:00.184 --> 21:02.520
They offered me a deal.
If I take their offer...

21:02.770 --> 21:07.316
they clear my record,
and I can get my name back.

21:16.117 --> 21:18.202
You and I are not getting back together.

21:18.453 --> 21:21.914
Don't flatter yourself.

21:22.373 --> 21:25.418
Pick me up at 3:00.

21:27.003 --> 21:28.504
Yes!

21:28.755 --> 21:32.175
While the number-field sieve
is the best method currently known...

21:32.425 --> 21:38.765
there exists an intriguing possibility
for a far more elegant approach.

21:39.015 --> 21:42.268
This guy's good.

21:42.685 --> 21:47.148
Over the rationals, and hence
contained in a single cyclotomic field.

21:47.398 --> 21:51.819
Using the Artin map,
we might induce homomorphisms...

21:52.987 --> 21:56.032
You seeing anybody?

21:59.202 --> 22:03.915
This isn't just about large-number theory.
It's about cryptography.

22:04.165 --> 22:06.417
You mean codes?

22:06.667 --> 22:10.338
I mean unbreakable codes.

22:10.922 --> 22:14.342
It would be a breakthrough
of Gaussian proportions...

22:14.592 --> 22:16.052
and allow us to acquire...

22:16.302 --> 22:22.391
the solution in a dramatically
more efficient manner.

22:22.767 --> 22:23.851
Are you seeing...

22:24.102 --> 22:28.981
Such an approach is purely theoretical.
So far, no one has been able...

22:29.232 --> 22:33.402
to accomplish such constructions...

22:33.611 --> 22:35.947
yet.

22:36.197 --> 22:38.407
The numbers are so unbelievably big...

22:38.658 --> 22:41.494
all the computers in the world
could not break them down.

22:41.744 --> 22:44.539
But maybe, just maybe...

22:44.789 --> 22:48.835
there's a shortcut.
- I'll bet you anything he's found it.

22:49.085 --> 22:52.422
If he has, you're in over your head.
I'll get my coat.

22:52.672 --> 22:55.758
Numbers themselves
may be our best tools...

22:56.008 --> 22:59.011
may be able to see things
in other numbers that we can't.

22:59.262 --> 23:01.514
Martin.

23:01.764 --> 23:03.933
Martin, how wonderful to see you.

23:04.183 --> 23:06.352
- Hi, Greg. How are you?
- Is it not fabulous?

23:06.602 --> 23:10.690
Today I can in public come and learn
your scientists' new secrets.

23:10.940 --> 23:14.110
Alas, I did not understand one bit
of what he was talking about.

23:14.360 --> 23:16.279
At least I...

23:16.529 --> 23:18.990
Goodness, can it be?

23:19.240 --> 23:20.240
Yeah.

23:20.324 --> 23:23.327
- Elizabeth!
- She's dying to talk to you too, Greg.

23:23.578 --> 23:27.039
Elizabeth.

23:28.750 --> 23:32.628
- Hello, Greg.
- Elizabeth and Martin.

23:32.879 --> 23:36.048
My heart leaps like gazelle
to see you back together again.

23:36.299 --> 23:38.676
Tell it to stop leaping.
We are not back together.

23:38.926 --> 23:41.929
No? What a pity.

23:42.180 --> 23:47.185
Wait. I have smashing idea. Martin!

23:47.435 --> 23:50.521
Kiev String Quartet plays
at the consulate on Thursday night.

23:50.772 --> 23:53.941
You will be my guests.

23:54.025 --> 23:57.069
Really, Greg,
I wouldn't know how to repay you.

23:57.320 --> 24:00.865
Martin, now that our countries
are such good friends...

24:01.115 --> 24:04.911
perhaps you will finally be able
to do occasional favor for me?

24:05.161 --> 24:09.415
- Gregor, you are shameless.
- See you Thursday night.

24:09.665 --> 24:11.584
What?

24:11.834 --> 24:13.419
New title.

24:13.669 --> 24:15.421
Cultural Attaché.

24:15.671 --> 24:17.090
Unbelievable!

24:17.340 --> 24:21.594
Last few years has been very confusing
for people in my line of work.

24:21.844 --> 24:24.472
I'll bet.

24:25.890 --> 24:29.227
I don't care what anybody says
about the new world order.

24:29.477 --> 24:31.104
I don't trust that guy.

24:31.354 --> 24:33.689
Who, Greg? He's harmless.

24:33.940 --> 24:37.443
Let the number itself tell us.

24:41.239 --> 24:42.406
If you'll excuse me...

24:42.657 --> 24:47.829
I have some work.
- You're gonna follow him, aren't you?

24:48.621 --> 24:50.540
It's okay. I'll get a cab.

24:50.790 --> 24:53.793
Can I call you?

24:54.502 --> 24:57.505
Just be careful.

25:19.819 --> 25:21.529
Janek just got in the elevator.

25:21.779 --> 25:23.990
- Going up.
- We will be ready for him.

25:24.240 --> 25:27.618
- How's the audio?
- Good. Mother's close.

25:27.869 --> 25:30.955
He's just wearing
four safety belts this time.

25:31.205 --> 25:33.166
What, no parachute?

25:33.416 --> 25:37.879
All right. Entry and lights on.

25:38.087 --> 25:40.548
- Describe it.
- Looks like a workroom.

25:40.798 --> 25:46.220
A bench with a soldering gun,
two spools of wire and a magnifying lamp.

25:46.471 --> 25:49.724
Sounds like he's making somethin'.

25:49.974 --> 25:52.852
Then a desk.

25:53.144 --> 25:57.148
Telephone, lamp, answering machine.

25:57.398 --> 25:59.567
A jar of pencils, but no little black box.

25:59.817 --> 26:02.487
It's gotta be there somewhere.
What's he doing?

26:02.737 --> 26:06.240
He's logging on the computer.

26:09.202 --> 26:10.787
This is good.

26:11.037 --> 26:16.250
He's gonna type in his password,
and we're gonna get a clear shot.

26:25.218 --> 26:27.470
<i>Dr. Rhyzkov, good evening.</i>

26:27.720 --> 26:31.307
Let's get an ID on Dr. Rhyzkov.
She was with him this afternoon.

26:31.557 --> 26:34.268
She was trying to tell him something
and it was making him...

26:34.519 --> 26:36.813
<i>Oh, Gunter.</i>

26:37.063 --> 26:40.858
<i>Let's do what we did in Mexico City.</i>

26:41.234 --> 26:43.444
I didn't know you could do that
in Mexico City.

26:43.694 --> 26:46.197
- Mr. Bishop, mind if I take a look?
- Carl.

26:46.447 --> 26:49.283
Grow up.

26:51.577 --> 26:55.706
<i>- Let me see.
- Oh, Gunter.</i>

27:02.630 --> 27:04.340
<i>Elena, really!</i>

27:04.590 --> 27:09.011
<i>I must finish my work.</i>

27:11.180 --> 27:14.684
Okay, back to work.

27:15.143 --> 27:17.979
Nope, here we go.
Now we're gonna get our password.

27:18.229 --> 27:21.941
<i>I leave message here on service,
but you do not call.</i>

27:22.191 --> 27:23.901
<i>I'm sorry, really.</i>

27:24.152 --> 27:28.281
Get out of the way. She's in the way.

27:29.407 --> 27:31.951
<i>- I don't believe this.
- I'm sorry.</i>

27:32.201 --> 27:35.663
<i>It's just, I have this work.</i>

27:37.540 --> 27:39.709
<i>I give you something to work, baby.</i>

27:39.959 --> 27:44.088
<i>Okay. Just for a little while.</i>

27:48.551 --> 27:50.762
<i>Oh, Gunter.</i>

27:51.012 --> 27:54.557
- What's goin' on?
- Nothing.

27:55.558 --> 27:56.976
<i>Elena, really!</i>

27:57.226 --> 28:01.272
<i>I must finish my work.</i>

28:01.522 --> 28:05.276
<i>I leave message here on service,
but you do not call.</i>

28:05.526 --> 28:07.779
Maybe there's a frame
where she doesn't block it.

28:08.029 --> 28:10.531
I'll blow it up.

28:10.782 --> 28:13.367
- Gentlemen.
- Who's Rhyzkov?

28:13.618 --> 28:17.580
Dr. Elena Rhyzkov,
visiting professor from Czechoslovakia...

28:17.830 --> 28:20.833
senior research fellow in astrophysics.

28:21.084 --> 28:26.214
- Bingo.
- Setec Astronomy, whatever that is.

28:26.464 --> 28:30.384
<i>I leave message here on service,
but you do not call.</i>

28:30.635 --> 28:33.638
<i>- There.
- I'm sorry.</i>

28:33.971 --> 28:37.141
- "W", "G"...
- Looks like the "H".

28:37.391 --> 28:39.031
- Where do you get "H"?
- Next to the "L".

28:39.268 --> 28:43.356
- Come on. Do it again.
- "H" isn't next to the "L".

28:45.483 --> 28:50.071
<i>I leave message here on service,
but you do not call.</i>

28:56.244 --> 28:57.829
Okay, that's definitely "W", "G".

28:58.079 --> 29:00.540
Definitely not. No, that's a "V".

29:00.790 --> 29:02.083
She's in the way.

29:02.333 --> 29:05.878
Fellas, Janek's little black box
is on his desk...

29:06.129 --> 29:10.091
between the pencil jar and the lamp.

29:10.216 --> 29:14.804
Whistler, I hate to tell you this,
but you're blind.

29:16.222 --> 29:17.890
Play the tape back again.

29:18.141 --> 29:22.979
- But you can't see anything.
- Don't look. Listen.

29:23.104 --> 29:25.523
Play it back.

29:25.773 --> 29:29.068
<i>I leave message here on service,
but you do not...</i>

29:29.318 --> 29:31.821
He's got a service.

29:32.071 --> 29:36.117
What's he need an answering machine for?

29:37.535 --> 29:41.038
There's our little black box.

29:47.837 --> 29:49.255
Okay, boss.

29:49.505 --> 29:53.384
This LTX-71 concealable mike is part
of the same system that NASA used...

29:53.634 --> 29:55.970
when they faked
the Apollo moon landings.

29:56.220 --> 29:59.015
The astronauts broadcast
around the world from a soundstage...

29:59.265 --> 30:01.851
at Norton Air Force Base,
San Bernardino, California.

30:02.101 --> 30:05.855
So it worked for them.
It shouldn't give us too many problems.

30:06.105 --> 30:08.649
Thanks.

30:09.150 --> 30:12.153
- You didn't have a delivery?
- I should have the invoice.

30:12.403 --> 30:16.032
No delivery is scheduled.
They didn't have anything on record.

30:16.282 --> 30:18.326
Did my wife drop a cake off for me?

30:18.576 --> 30:21.287
- There's no cake here.
- Party for Marge on the second floor.

30:21.537 --> 30:24.832
- She was supposed to drop a cake off.
- I don't know about it.

30:25.083 --> 30:26.459
There she is, late as usual.

30:26.709 --> 30:31.589
It states here that I am to deliver
36 boxes of Liquid Drano to this address.

30:31.839 --> 30:35.676
I don't care what that says.
You're not on the list, you can't get in.

30:35.927 --> 30:39.764
- I might lose my job.
- That's not my problem. Now beat it.

30:40.014 --> 30:42.058
I can't reach my card.
Could you buzz this?

30:42.308 --> 30:44.811
- Just buzz it. I can't reach my card.
- Wait one minute.

30:45.061 --> 30:50.066
We're late for a party on the second floor.
Push the goddamned buzzer.

30:50.316 --> 30:52.860
Thanks.

31:18.678 --> 31:23.307
Anybody remember how to defeat
an electronic keypad?

31:23.599 --> 31:26.477
Don't even joke about that.
Those things are impossible.

31:26.727 --> 31:29.522
Think I'm joking?
Looks like they just put it in.

31:29.772 --> 31:32.442
Oh, boy.

31:34.944 --> 31:39.031
This might help. An old buddy of mine
who was in Desert Storm sent it to me.

31:39.282 --> 31:42.994
'Course, he was on the other side.

31:43.327 --> 31:45.913
<i>Come on. There's got to be
a way around these things.</i>

31:46.164 --> 31:49.292
All right, all right.

31:53.254 --> 31:55.798
This might work.

31:56.048 --> 31:59.260
Yeah. Yeah.

32:00.553 --> 32:03.264
Right.

32:09.270 --> 32:13.357
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

32:15.818 --> 32:18.488
It worked.

32:46.140 --> 32:48.184
Got it.

32:48.434 --> 32:53.606
- Gunter? You're not...
- God, no. Here you go. Nice to see you.

32:54.649 --> 32:57.527
- Who the hell is that?
- Battle stations.

32:57.777 --> 33:01.072
Monitor the audio. Grab the mike.

33:01.107 --> 33:02.115
Okay.

33:02.365 --> 33:04.659
I'm gonna remove my hand now.
Please, don't scream.

33:04.909 --> 33:07.703
I promise, nothing will happen to you.

33:07.954 --> 33:10.373
Okay?

33:15.628 --> 33:18.381
Who are you?

33:19.340 --> 33:22.176
- He's a PI.
- You're a private investigator.

33:22.427 --> 33:26.597
- I'm a private investigator.
- But why?

33:26.848 --> 33:29.892
Who hired you?

33:30.643 --> 33:35.273
- Who hired you?
- Mrs. Janek.

33:35.440 --> 33:38.943
There is not Mrs. Janek.

33:39.944 --> 33:42.530
Yeah?

33:42.822 --> 33:45.575
You got us stumped.

33:45.825 --> 33:51.581
Oh, yeah? Who do you think paid
for your little love jaunt to Mexico City?

33:55.334 --> 33:57.920
That was good.

33:58.004 --> 33:59.297
Velma Janek.

33:59.547 --> 34:03.217
She lives in Montreal where she handles
her family's real estate holdings...

34:03.468 --> 34:06.763
vast real estate holdings:
Farms, banks, shopping malls.

34:07.013 --> 34:08.556
Two shopping malls.

34:08.806 --> 34:13.060
She supports Gunter but figured he
was cheating. That's why she hired me.

34:13.311 --> 34:16.481
Bastard liar!

34:17.231 --> 34:19.358
- I'll kill him!
- No, no, no!

34:19.609 --> 34:21.985
No, don't. Get a hold
of yourself, Dr. Rhyzkov.

34:22.235 --> 34:23.905
Get a hold of yourself.

34:24.155 --> 34:27.074
You gotta not tell him you know.

34:27.324 --> 34:30.203
We weren't here. We didn't talk.
You don't know me.

34:30.453 --> 34:32.371
You don't know anything about a wife.

34:32.621 --> 34:36.000
You just give me one good reason why.

34:36.250 --> 34:39.420
I'll give you a reason.

34:40.797 --> 34:44.342
Give you a really good reason.

34:45.134 --> 34:47.053
It's just what she'd want you to do.

34:47.303 --> 34:49.013
It's just what she'd want you to do.

34:49.263 --> 34:53.016
It's just what she'd want you to do.

34:53.184 --> 34:56.228
I don't understand.

34:56.521 --> 34:58.773
Yeah, sometimes
I don't understand myself.

34:59.023 --> 35:02.610
Look, I might lose my license for this...

35:02.860 --> 35:06.197
but my client is
a vindictive, bitter woman.

35:06.447 --> 35:10.993
She's been withholding marital favors
for years and now she's out to ruin him.

35:11.244 --> 35:13.454
And she's using you to get to her.

35:13.704 --> 35:17.875
And she's using me to get to you.

35:18.501 --> 35:21.462
I know that's confusing,
but don't you see what's happening here?

35:21.712 --> 35:26.175
You and me,
we're pawns in this ugly little game.

35:26.426 --> 35:29.595
- If you love him...
- If you love him...

35:29.846 --> 35:32.849
If you love him...

35:33.683 --> 35:38.229
if you really love him...

35:38.438 --> 35:41.065
then just keep on loving him.

35:41.315 --> 35:46.737
Never let him know that you know what
he thinks you don't know that you know.

35:46.988 --> 35:48.739
You know?

35:48.990 --> 35:50.741
And give him head whenever he wants.

35:50.992 --> 35:54.454
Give him help.

35:55.121 --> 36:00.001
Be a beacon in his sad and lonely life.

36:00.251 --> 36:03.087
Can you do that for Gunter?

36:03.337 --> 36:06.966
- Yes, yes, I can. I can.
- Okay, good.

36:07.216 --> 36:10.261
Now get outta here.

36:17.310 --> 36:19.228
Give him head?

36:19.479 --> 36:22.523
Be a beacon?

36:55.431 --> 36:57.350
The key meeting took place July 1, 1958.

36:57.600 --> 37:00.436
The Air Force brought this space visitor
to the White House...

37:00.686 --> 37:02.438
for an interview with Eisenhower.

37:02.688 --> 37:06.526
Ike said, "Give us technology,
we'll give you all the cow lips you want."

37:06.776 --> 37:08.861
Don't listen to this man. He's certifiable.

37:09.112 --> 37:11.030
Your husband knows
about cattle mutilations.

37:11.280 --> 37:15.326
He's ex-CIA. He knows the government's
been suppressing for years.

37:15.576 --> 37:16.786
Understood, understood.

37:17.036 --> 37:19.497
One thing I don't quite get, though...

37:19.747 --> 37:25.294
was you and Cosmo,
you were taking all these big chances...

37:25.545 --> 37:27.839
what for?

37:28.089 --> 37:32.760
We were young. And there was a war on.

37:34.345 --> 37:37.974
- It was a good way to meet girls.
- I'll bet.

37:38.224 --> 37:42.061
How come you didn't get caught?

37:44.856 --> 37:47.316
I went out for pizza.

37:47.567 --> 37:50.111
Then I went to Canada.

37:50.361 --> 37:52.655
I was lucky. He wasn't.

37:52.905 --> 37:55.158
Did he ever forgive you?

37:55.408 --> 37:58.244
I hope so.

37:58.619 --> 38:01.622
He died in prison.

38:08.546 --> 38:13.176
So, what are you guys gonna do
with your share of the money?

38:13.426 --> 38:15.845
Don?

38:16.387 --> 38:19.140
We have never been to Europe together.

38:19.390 --> 38:22.727
And we are going.

38:22.977 --> 38:26.773
- Madrid, Lisbon.
- Athens and Scotland.

38:27.023 --> 38:29.942
- And Tahiti.
- Yes, yes.

38:30.193 --> 38:33.112
- Mother?
- Well, you know...

38:33.362 --> 38:37.575
I've never actually had a really cool
car that I could fit comfortably into.

38:37.825 --> 38:40.453
So I think I'm gonna buy me a Winnebago...

38:40.703 --> 38:46.793
with a big kitchen, water bed.
Big kitchen.

38:47.293 --> 38:49.128
Carl?

38:49.378 --> 38:51.255
I'd like to have a deep relationship...

38:51.506 --> 38:56.260
with a beautiful woman, who melts
from the very first time our eyes meet.

38:56.511 --> 38:59.555
We're not getting paid that much, Carl.

38:59.806 --> 39:02.934
Well, you know, someone like Liz.

39:03.184 --> 39:07.396
You're definitely
not getting paid that much.

39:07.980 --> 39:10.608
Whistler?

39:11.150 --> 39:12.985
Peace on earth, goodwill toward men.

39:13.236 --> 39:15.029
Right on.

39:15.279 --> 39:16.823
And women.

39:17.073 --> 39:20.326
- All right.
- Hear, hear!

39:23.579 --> 39:25.665
- That's not a word, "scrunchy".
- Yes, it is.

39:25.915 --> 39:28.209
- Scrunchy is not a word.
- Scrunchy is a word.

39:28.459 --> 39:30.378
- Since when?
- Know what happens to your face?

39:30.628 --> 39:33.089
- It's not a word.
- Right now your face is scrunchy.

39:33.339 --> 39:37.468
All right. We gotta take it as a word.

39:45.601 --> 39:48.646
- I have...
- I didn't invent the word.

39:48.896 --> 39:50.982
- Carl?
- Yes?

39:51.232 --> 39:53.526
What does it say where this is?

39:53.776 --> 39:56.946
Hold on a second here.

39:57.989 --> 40:01.075
"System out."

40:02.535 --> 40:03.786
Guys...

40:04.036 --> 40:07.457
I really think you should
leave that thing alone.

40:07.707 --> 40:13.087
Yeah, I know. I just wanted
to see something. Don't worry, Don.

40:14.255 --> 40:18.718
- How are they spelling Setec?
- S-E-T-E-C. Setec.

40:18.968 --> 40:22.263
Special extraterrestrial?

40:22.513 --> 40:25.850
Earthling counter.

40:26.184 --> 40:29.312
Is that right? Two, four, five.

40:29.562 --> 40:33.399
And she begins to go,
and this one bull turns around...

40:33.649 --> 40:37.153
and looks at me
like right dead in my eye.

40:37.403 --> 40:39.822
- Setec.
- What?

40:40.072 --> 40:42.492
Setec Astronomy.

40:42.742 --> 40:46.871
I just love it when a man says that to me.

40:46.996 --> 40:50.458
Setec doesn't mean anything.

40:52.168 --> 40:54.837
Excuse me.

41:20.696 --> 41:22.156
Carl...

41:22.406 --> 41:29.038
can you get me some cable
and that I/O interface, please?

41:37.588 --> 41:40.466
"Monterey's coast."

41:40.716 --> 41:44.887
Does "Monterey's coast"
mean anything to you guys?

41:45.138 --> 41:48.141
- No.
- No.

41:50.852 --> 41:54.105
Here, help me with this.

42:02.447 --> 42:06.242
Carl, get the diagnostics.

42:11.998 --> 42:16.169
How about "my Socrates note"?

42:16.586 --> 42:19.172
No.

42:32.268 --> 42:36.063
- No, I don't...
- No. No.

42:45.531 --> 42:48.868
Got it. Move to another one.

42:58.669 --> 43:01.735
Give me another one.

43:01.770 --> 43:04.801
Stay in that quadrant.

43:12.725 --> 43:17.396
It's kind of the same thing.
Try another quadrant.

43:19.899 --> 43:22.068
Mother, what was that? Go back one.

43:22.318 --> 43:24.987
All right.

43:25.738 --> 43:28.825
Holy cow.

43:29.409 --> 43:32.787
What the hell is this?

43:47.427 --> 43:50.680
"Too many secrets."

43:53.433 --> 43:58.229
Bish, I think you better come over here.

43:58.479 --> 44:01.107
- Carl, got your black book?
- Yes.

44:01.357 --> 44:06.028
Give me the number
for something impossible to access.

44:06.779 --> 44:08.739
Okay. What about this?

44:08.990 --> 44:11.242
Federal Reserve Transfer Node,
Culpepper, Virginia.

44:11.492 --> 44:14.579
- Yeah, sure. Good luck.
- 900 billion a day go through there.

44:14.829 --> 44:17.165
That'll do. Punch it in.

44:17.415 --> 44:21.377
Okay. We won't get in.

44:21.627 --> 44:24.756
It's encrypted.

44:29.427 --> 44:31.387
See?

44:31.637 --> 44:34.974
Mother, that last contact.

44:43.483 --> 44:46.694
Look at this, boys.

44:46.819 --> 44:51.074
Anybody want to shut down
the Federal Reserve?

44:51.157 --> 44:53.242
- Don't screw around with that thing!
- Wait.

44:53.493 --> 44:58.581
- Carl, what else you got?
- National power grid?

44:59.248 --> 45:02.168
Okay.

45:05.671 --> 45:09.467
Here we come. Hey, Mother.

45:09.717 --> 45:12.720
Probing.

45:15.598 --> 45:18.768
Unbelievable.

45:19.644 --> 45:24.774
Anybody want to black out New England?
Carl, what else?

45:25.024 --> 45:28.236
Air traffic control system.

45:36.327 --> 45:39.080
Okay, Mother.

45:43.418 --> 45:46.421
Oh, my God.

45:46.504 --> 45:48.005
How is this possible?

45:48.256 --> 45:51.134
Cryptography systems are based
on mathematical problems...

45:51.384 --> 45:54.429
so complex they cannot be solved
without a key.

45:54.679 --> 45:57.974
Janek figured out a way to solve
those problems without the key...

45:58.224 --> 46:01.978
and he hard-wired it into that chip.
- Turn it off.

46:02.228 --> 46:05.898
- Want to crash some passenger jets?
- I said turn it off.

46:06.149 --> 46:08.860
Turn it off.

46:18.578 --> 46:20.538
So it's a code-breaker.

46:20.788 --> 46:26.753
No, it's the code-breaker.

46:28.171 --> 46:31.132
No more secrets.

46:32.008 --> 46:36.053
Honey, you and Melissa get your things.

46:40.308 --> 46:43.811
- Night-night.
- Good night.

46:47.899 --> 46:50.735
What time is the hand-off?

46:50.985 --> 46:53.786
9:00 a. m.

46:53.821 --> 47:00.286
Well, between now and then, we are going
to institute some security around here.

47:02.288 --> 47:03.456
This is where I get off.

47:03.706 --> 47:07.043
Nice to see you again. I'm out of here.

47:07.293 --> 47:10.463
Don't take this personally, Liz...

47:10.713 --> 47:13.841
but you were the only one
who knew Martin's secret.

47:14.092 --> 47:16.636
Somebody talked.

47:16.886 --> 47:21.099
So make yourself comfortable.
We're all staying right here tonight.

47:21.349 --> 47:22.809
No.

47:23.059 --> 47:26.521
I'm getting my bag, and I'm leaving.

47:26.771 --> 47:30.066
So relax, Crease.

47:30.858 --> 47:36.906
I'll relax when we get that damn thing
out of here. Until then, you stay.

47:40.118 --> 47:42.412
What?

47:42.662 --> 47:48.543
There isn't a government on this planet
that wouldn't kill us all for that thing.

47:57.552 --> 48:01.055
- Sorry.
- I see.

48:01.305 --> 48:03.141
Carl, would you get the alarm?

48:03.391 --> 48:05.893
- Mother, lock everything down.
- Unplug that thing.

48:06.144 --> 48:07.603
- Kill the lights.
- You bet.

48:07.854 --> 48:11.441
Thank you for the trust, fellas.

48:51.063 --> 48:54.901
I really enjoyed sleeping
with all you guys. Take care.

48:55.151 --> 48:58.488
- Bye, Liz.
- You too, Liz.

49:08.247 --> 49:11.959
I hope the hand-off goes well.

49:13.711 --> 49:18.257
I'd hate for you to have
something new to run from.

49:22.553 --> 49:26.974
Martin? Time.

49:29.894 --> 49:32.688
Yeah.

50:10.268 --> 50:13.729
Morning. Any problems?

50:13.980 --> 50:16.566
- Nope.
- Want a cappuccino?

50:16.816 --> 50:19.277
No.

50:40.423 --> 50:43.217
Got his check?

50:47.388 --> 50:49.474
Hey, Martin!

50:49.724 --> 50:53.728
- Telephone!
- Just a minute.

50:53.978 --> 50:57.607
It's your mother.

51:09.911 --> 51:15.833
She's old. Excuse me.

51:27.136 --> 51:30.139
- Get in the car.
- What?

51:30.389 --> 51:33.184
Get in the car.

51:34.435 --> 51:35.978
I didn't get the money.

51:36.229 --> 51:39.023
Now!

51:41.359 --> 51:43.986
What are you doing?
I didn't get the money.

51:44.237 --> 51:47.198
Janek's dead.

51:47.949 --> 51:49.200
They killed him.

51:49.450 --> 51:52.286
The NSA doesn't kill people, Martin.
Who are they?

51:52.537 --> 51:56.165
You said there isn't a government
on earth that wouldn't kill for that thing.

51:56.416 --> 51:59.210
Not ours. Who were those guys?

51:59.460 --> 52:02.839
There's one way to find out.

52:21.983 --> 52:26.696
They took away my home. Help me out?

52:26.946 --> 52:31.033
The government took away my home.

52:31.951 --> 52:34.912
My God.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.627
Don't tell me you can't do it
because I know you can.

52:41.878 --> 52:44.839
And don't tell me you won't do it
because I've got to have it.

52:45.089 --> 52:47.175
I need to know, and I need to know now.

52:47.425 --> 52:50.928
Guys, that federal building's been
scheduled for demolition since August.

52:51.179 --> 52:54.056
Housed the Federal Trade Commission,
and Dept. Of Agriculture.

52:54.307 --> 52:55.308
Been vacant for a month.

52:55.558 --> 52:57.727
The NSA never had an office
in San Francisco.

52:57.977 --> 53:00.396
Their West Coast operations are out
of Los Angeles.

53:00.646 --> 53:04.157
Oh, God. Yeah, thanks.

53:04.192 --> 53:07.820
Janek's grant is from the NSA.

53:09.322 --> 53:11.532
How could you be so goddamn stupid?

53:11.783 --> 53:14.869
Two guys show up, say they're
government, and you just buy it.

53:15.119 --> 53:18.831
They probably were government...

53:20.124 --> 53:23.086
just not ours.

53:26.339 --> 53:31.219
Everybody pack up whatever you can.
This place isn't safe.

53:31.344 --> 53:36.349
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to a concert.

54:00.039 --> 54:02.625
Keep smiling.

54:02.875 --> 54:08.256
- Martin, have you lost your mind?
- Excuse yourself.

54:09.090 --> 54:13.469
Darling, would you excuse me
for a moment?

54:26.899 --> 54:31.404
- Give me back Janek's box, Greg.
- Martin, I don't have it.

54:31.654 --> 54:34.949
- Now you must believe me.
- No.

54:35.199 --> 54:37.702
You set me up, Greg.
No, I do not believe you.

54:37.952 --> 54:40.496
We had nothing to do
with this Janek business.

54:40.747 --> 54:43.040
Not for lack of trying, mind you.

54:43.291 --> 54:45.543
Your codes are entirely
different from ours.

54:45.793 --> 54:50.923
We never had any luck in breaking them
so Lord knows, I wanted that box...

54:51.174 --> 54:54.510
but we did not take it.

54:58.347 --> 55:01.350
Then who did?

55:03.394 --> 55:06.272
What I will tell you now,
I cannot tell you in this building.

55:06.522 --> 55:09.567
Do you understand?

55:09.859 --> 55:12.737
Come.

55:15.573 --> 55:18.493
Martin.

55:19.577 --> 55:22.538
You must trust me.

55:29.754 --> 55:33.633
- Him?
- No.

55:33.800 --> 55:37.261
- Him?
- No.

55:41.641 --> 55:43.893
- Him?
- No.

55:44.143 --> 55:47.021
I'm afraid these books are not
as current as they used to be.

55:47.271 --> 55:49.065
You still keep tabs on all our agents.

55:49.315 --> 55:51.526
These are just the ones
we thought we could turn.

55:51.776 --> 55:56.322
You know, sexual problems,
financial troubles.

55:56.572 --> 56:00.159
Then we had financial troubles.

56:00.701 --> 56:03.913
That's him. The older guy.

56:04.163 --> 56:08.543
A loathsome man named Buddy Devries,
a. k.a. Buddy Weber...

56:08.793 --> 56:12.255
Buddy Wallace.
- Wallace. That's him.

56:12.505 --> 56:15.716
We tried to recruit him in '83.

56:15.967 --> 56:19.137
Drinking problem, married three times.

56:19.387 --> 56:23.015
Left the NSA four years ago.

56:23.224 --> 56:25.726
Oh, my.

56:25.977 --> 56:28.771
What?

56:30.690 --> 56:32.859
What?

56:33.109 --> 56:39.365
You disappeared once before, my friend.
I suggest you do it again.

56:39.574 --> 56:44.036
Why? Who's he workin' for?

56:46.581 --> 56:51.002
Your FBI is such a pain in the ass.

56:55.047 --> 56:57.300
Who's he workin' for?

56:57.550 --> 57:01.304
Martin, I can offer you
asylum inside this car.

57:01.554 --> 57:04.932
Technically, it's part of the consulate.
Do you wish our protection?

57:05.183 --> 57:09.645
What? Who is Wallace working for?

57:12.607 --> 57:15.526
Mr. Bishop? My name is
Special Agent Bestrop, FBI.

57:15.777 --> 57:18.780
Please, step out of the vehicle.

57:19.030 --> 57:21.908
- Do you wish our protection?
- Mr. Bishop...

57:22.158 --> 57:25.703
get out of the vehicle now.

57:30.458 --> 57:34.545
You won't know who to trust.

57:38.424 --> 57:43.888
Mr. Bishop, step over here, please.
Hands on the wall, sir.

57:54.148 --> 57:56.150
Is this loaded?

57:56.400 --> 57:59.070
Yes.

58:22.510 --> 58:25.513
Too many secrets.

59:37.752 --> 59:41.964
- Oh, shit.
- What are you doin' up?

01:00:34.033 --> 01:00:36.828
Pain?

01:00:39.122 --> 01:00:41.916
Yeah.

01:00:47.588 --> 01:00:50.633
Try aspirin.

01:00:55.805 --> 01:00:58.725
Cosmo.

01:01:02.895 --> 01:01:05.398
I'm sorry if he hurt you.

01:01:05.648 --> 01:01:09.902
I'm afraid Wallace doesn't
like you very much.

01:01:11.404 --> 01:01:13.573
You ought to have that guy
checked for rabies.

01:01:13.823 --> 01:01:17.577
Rabies occurs only
in warm-blooded animals.

01:01:17.827 --> 01:01:20.955
Anyway, I couldn't have you talking
to the Russians.

01:01:21.205 --> 01:01:24.876
Five years ago, yes, we could trust them
not to go running to the FBI...

01:01:25.126 --> 01:01:29.797
or if they did, we could trust the FBI
not to believe them. Today...

01:01:30.048 --> 01:01:32.216
we can't trust anybody.

01:01:32.467 --> 01:01:35.053
What the hell's goin' on here?

01:01:35.303 --> 01:01:39.640
Cosmo, what happened?

01:01:39.891 --> 01:01:45.938
The world changed on us, Marty,
and without our help.

01:01:46.105 --> 01:01:49.400
What happened?

01:01:54.572 --> 01:01:56.532
There I was in prison...

01:01:56.783 --> 01:02:01.913
and one day I help some nice older
gentlemen make some free phone calls.

01:02:02.163 --> 01:02:07.669
They turn out to be, let us say,
good family men.

01:02:08.961 --> 01:02:13.091
- Organized crime?
- Don't kid yourself.

01:02:13.341 --> 01:02:15.551
It's not that organized.

01:02:15.802 --> 01:02:17.387
Anyway, they arranged for me...

01:02:17.637 --> 01:02:20.890
to get an early release
from my unfortunate incarceration...

01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:24.769
and I began to perform
a variety of services.

01:02:25.019 --> 01:02:29.023
For starters, I reorganized
their entire financial operation:

01:02:29.273 --> 01:02:31.901
Budgets, payroll,
money laundering, you name it.

01:02:32.151 --> 01:02:35.446
The whole network is protected
by a very powerful encryption system...

01:02:35.697 --> 01:02:37.323
so the government can't read it.

01:02:37.573 --> 01:02:41.619
But if the feds get Janek's box...

01:02:41.911 --> 01:02:46.833
Disaster. Therefore, we must have it.

01:02:47.083 --> 01:02:52.380
- To protect the organization.
- Yes.

01:02:53.548 --> 01:02:56.759
No, I don't buy it.

01:02:57.010 --> 01:02:59.846
I know you.

01:03:00.972 --> 01:03:04.308
God, it's good to see you.

01:03:15.903 --> 01:03:19.699
We were going to change the world,
Marty, remember?

01:03:19.949 --> 01:03:23.786
Did you ever get around
to actually doing it? No, I guess not.

01:03:24.037 --> 01:03:27.582
- Well, I think I can.
- Really?

01:03:27.832 --> 01:03:30.543
Yes.

01:03:33.504 --> 01:03:36.215
What's wrong with this country, Marty?

01:03:36.466 --> 01:03:38.760
Money. You taught me that.

01:03:39.010 --> 01:03:42.221
Evil defense contractors had it,
noble causes did not.

01:03:42.472 --> 01:03:46.768
Politicians are bought and sold like
so much chattel. Our problems multiply.

01:03:47.018 --> 01:03:50.188
Pollution, crime, drugs, poverty,
disease, hunger, despair.

01:03:50.438 --> 01:03:53.733
We throw gobs of money at them.

01:03:53.983 --> 01:03:56.778
The problems always get worse.
Why is that?

01:03:57.028 --> 01:04:00.823
Money's most powerful ability is to allow
bad people to do bad things...

01:04:01.074 --> 01:04:03.409
at the expense of those
who don't have it.

01:04:03.659 --> 01:04:04.369
I agree.

01:04:04.619 --> 01:04:08.665
- Who did you say you were working for?
- That's just my day job.

01:04:08.915 --> 01:04:13.169
While in prison, I learned everything
in this world, including money...

01:04:13.419 --> 01:04:18.675
operates not on reality...
- But the perception of reality.

01:04:20.551 --> 01:04:23.888
Posit: People think a bank
might be financially shaky.

01:04:24.138 --> 01:04:26.516
- Consequence:
- People start to withdraw their money.

01:04:26.766 --> 01:04:31.729
- Result: Soon, it is financially shaky.
- Conclusion: You can make banks fail.

01:04:31.979 --> 01:04:36.651
I've already done that.
Maybe you've read about a few?

01:04:36.686 --> 01:04:37.686
Think bigger.

01:04:37.902 --> 01:04:38.945
- Stock market?
- Yes.

01:04:39.195 --> 01:04:41.656
- Currency market? Commodities market?
- Yes.

01:04:41.906 --> 01:04:44.909
Small countries?

01:04:46.452 --> 01:04:50.873
I might even be able to crash
the whole damn system.

01:04:51.124 --> 01:04:54.961
Destroy all records of ownership.
Think of it, Marty.

01:04:55.211 --> 01:04:58.923
No more rich people, no more poor people,
everybody's the same.

01:04:59.173 --> 01:05:02.885
Isn't that what we said we always wanted?

01:05:03.136 --> 01:05:05.513
Cos, you haven't gone crazy
on me, have you?

01:05:05.763 --> 01:05:09.058
Who else is going
to change the world, Marty?

01:05:09.308 --> 01:05:12.311
Greenpeace?

01:05:17.567 --> 01:05:20.653
You are crazy.

01:05:25.575 --> 01:05:27.577
Tomorrow they'll retrieve
your fingerprints...

01:05:27.827 --> 01:05:30.371
from the gun that killed
a Russian consular officer.

01:05:30.621 --> 01:05:34.417
The following day, those prints will be run
through an FBI computer...

01:05:34.667 --> 01:05:38.004
and they will come up with a name.

01:05:41.799 --> 01:05:43.843
Martin Brice...

01:05:44.093 --> 01:05:47.513
my old and good friend, who promised
me we would not get in trouble...

01:05:47.764 --> 01:05:49.057
and who, I might add, didn't.

01:05:49.307 --> 01:05:51.976
Then they'll check this database
in Washington, D. C...

01:05:52.226 --> 01:05:55.063
which I'm now able to access,
thanks to you.

01:05:55.313 --> 01:06:01.444
Of course, no one knows
where Martin Brice is, do they?

01:06:01.479 --> 01:06:06.074
But what if this indicated...

01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:11.245
an alias?

01:06:11.662 --> 01:06:17.001
Don't. Don't do it, Cos.

01:06:17.168 --> 01:06:20.088
Pain?

01:06:21.964 --> 01:06:24.967
Try prison.

01:06:28.554 --> 01:06:31.224
Ciao.

01:06:32.892 --> 01:06:36.312
- Oh, no, not the head.
- Just relax.

01:06:36.562 --> 01:06:39.816
No more secrets, Marty.

01:07:31.492 --> 01:07:34.620
- I've had a bad night.
- Really?

01:07:34.871 --> 01:07:37.665
- You look terrific.
- You look awful.

01:07:37.915 --> 01:07:40.460
I should think so,
considering what I've been through.

01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:43.588
- What happened?
- You tell me.

01:07:43.838 --> 01:07:49.010
You got hit over the head twice
and got thrown out of a speeding car.

01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:52.472
Here, let me do this.

01:07:55.391 --> 01:07:58.353
I'm sorry.

01:07:58.519 --> 01:08:01.689
It's okay. L...

01:08:03.274 --> 01:08:06.778
I'm sorry.

01:08:14.744 --> 01:08:18.538
The paper said that Greg was killed.

01:08:19.332 --> 01:08:21.709
I called your number,
and someone else answered.

01:08:21.959 --> 01:08:25.837
I didn't recognize the voice.

01:08:36.724 --> 01:08:40.353
I can't do this alone, Liz.

01:08:40.687 --> 01:08:43.689
I'm here.

01:09:02.667 --> 01:09:03.751
We have to meet.

01:09:04.002 --> 01:09:06.879
<i>The FBI says the fingerprints
found in the embassy car...</i>

01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:10.383
<i>match those taken from the office
of a government researcher...</i>

01:09:10.633 --> 01:09:13.094
<i>found murdered earlier this week
in Palo Alto.</i>

01:09:13.344 --> 01:09:16.430
<i>The connection was made after
a Bay Area radio station received...</i>

01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:19.308
<i>an anonymous tip
linking the two killings.</i>

01:09:19.559 --> 01:09:22.854
I'll bet it was anonymous!
The son of a bitch.

01:09:23.104 --> 01:09:25.982
All right, it's time we
call the authorities.

01:09:26.232 --> 01:09:29.777
Great. Now that we're accessories
to espionage and murder.

01:09:30.028 --> 01:09:33.781
All the more reason to turn ourselves
in now while we can still cut a deal.

01:09:34.032 --> 01:09:38.118
With what? We got bupkus! They'll give
us 20 years in the electric chair.

01:09:38.368 --> 01:09:42.332
You think I like it? I've got a family!
We have no other choice.

01:09:42.582 --> 01:09:44.959
Yes, we do.

01:09:45.209 --> 01:09:49.339
We make the call, but we make it our way.

01:09:49.589 --> 01:09:50.589
Unload the van.

01:09:50.715 --> 01:09:55.762
We got these band wideners here, Whis.
Where do you want 'em?

01:09:57.972 --> 01:10:02.602
Thanks. Nice apartment.

01:10:04.187 --> 01:10:06.773
I'll bounce this call
through nine relay stations...

01:10:07.023 --> 01:10:09.275
around the world and off two satellites.

01:10:09.525 --> 01:10:12.403
It'll be the hardest trace
they've ever heard.

01:10:12.653 --> 01:10:15.531
This'll measure stress
in the voice on the other end.

01:10:15.782 --> 01:10:19.035
Not as accurate as a
polygraph, but it'll do.

01:10:19.285 --> 01:10:24.040
- Unbelievable.
- Let's do it.

01:10:33.424 --> 01:10:37.011
<i>Fort Meade, Maryland. Good afternoon.</i>

01:10:37.261 --> 01:10:38.721
Try Director of Ops.

01:10:38.971 --> 01:10:42.266
National Security Agency,
Director of Operations, please.

01:10:42.517 --> 01:10:46.312
<i>- What extension, please?
- I'm sorry. I forget the number.</i>

01:10:46.562 --> 01:10:49.357
Could I have Director of Operations?
It's very important.

01:10:49.607 --> 01:10:52.276
<i>What extension, please?</i>

01:10:52.527 --> 01:10:54.445
Try Research.

01:10:54.696 --> 01:10:56.948
Gimme Research. It's an emergency.

01:10:57.198 --> 01:11:00.743
<i>I need an extension or a name.</i>

01:11:02.245 --> 01:11:05.915
Setec Astronomy.

01:11:06.207 --> 01:11:09.669
<i>One moment, please.</i>

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:12.422
They've started the trace.

01:11:12.672 --> 01:11:14.424
<i>Who is this, please?</i>

01:11:14.674 --> 01:11:17.135
It's my dime. I'll ask the questions.
Who are you?

01:11:17.385 --> 01:11:22.432
<i>- Let's say my name is Mr. Abbott.
- True.</i>

01:11:22.682 --> 01:11:26.060
- They made the second leg.
- Mr. Abbott...

01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:28.646
are you interested in Setec Astronomy?

01:11:28.896 --> 01:11:32.942
<i>I'm interested in all kinds of astronomy.</i>

01:11:35.361 --> 01:11:38.031
- Cute.
- They've got the satellite in Tokyo.

01:11:38.281 --> 01:11:41.367
These guys are good.

01:11:43.161 --> 01:11:45.872
I need to know if you're someone
who can make a deal.

01:11:46.122 --> 01:11:48.791
<i>- Go on.
- Can you deal?</i>

01:11:49.042 --> 01:11:51.085
<i>- Yes.
- True.</i>

01:11:51.336 --> 01:11:54.130
They're across Transcom.
You've got about 20 seconds, Bish.

01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:57.550
If I come in, can you guarantee my safety?

01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:01.012
<i>Do you have the item?</i>

01:12:01.971 --> 01:12:04.349
- No.
- Fifteen seconds.

01:12:04.599 --> 01:12:07.685
<i>- Can you guarantee my safety?
- Where is the item?</i>

01:12:07.935 --> 01:12:10.396
- Can you guarantee my safety?
- Five seconds.

01:12:10.646 --> 01:12:14.317
- Yes, I can guarantee your safety.
- Bish, he's lying.

01:12:14.567 --> 01:12:16.903
- Hang up. They've almost got us.
- He's lying!

01:12:17.153 --> 01:12:21.699
- Hang up, Bish! Hang up!
- He's lying! He's lying!

01:12:30.541 --> 01:12:32.919
There's gotta be a way to cut a deal.

01:12:33.169 --> 01:12:34.545
Too late.

01:12:34.796 --> 01:12:37.507
If we had the box, yes. Without it, no.

01:12:37.757 --> 01:12:39.676
So let's get this friggin' thing.

01:12:39.926 --> 01:12:43.471
- I don't know where it is.
- What did it sound like?

01:12:43.721 --> 01:12:46.599
- No idea where they took you?
- No.

01:12:46.849 --> 01:12:49.060
They threw me in a trunk,
drove around in circles.

01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:53.398
It could be 100 miles away,
underground, in a sky-rise. Forget it.

01:12:53.648 --> 01:12:56.234
- Bish, what did it sound like?
- What?

01:12:56.484 --> 01:13:01.155
The road. When you were in the trunk,
what did the road sound like?

01:13:01.406 --> 01:13:04.367
Well, I don't...
Highway. A regular highway.

01:13:04.617 --> 01:13:08.871
Did you go over
any speed bumps? Gravel?

01:13:09.122 --> 01:13:12.166
How about a bridge?

01:13:12.291 --> 01:13:16.462
- Bridge, yeah.
- Four bridges in the Bay Area.

01:13:16.713 --> 01:13:19.298
Was the Golden Gate fogged in last night?

01:13:19.549 --> 01:13:23.219
- Yes.
- Did you hear a foghorn?

01:13:23.594 --> 01:13:26.389
No.

01:13:26.889 --> 01:13:29.100
- Scratch the Golden Gate.
- That leaves three.

01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:32.562
What did it sound like?
Did you go through a tunnel?

01:13:32.812 --> 01:13:35.773
I'm not... No.

01:13:36.024 --> 01:13:37.483
Scratch the Bay.

01:13:37.734 --> 01:13:42.238
That leaves two.
San Mateo and Dunbarton.

01:13:42.405 --> 01:13:45.658
What did it sound like?

01:13:47.952 --> 01:13:50.913
Lower.

01:13:52.457 --> 01:13:55.126
Lower.

01:13:59.881 --> 01:14:02.383
There was a recurring sound.

01:14:02.633 --> 01:14:07.638
Like seams in the concrete.

01:14:13.686 --> 01:14:17.565
But further apart.

01:14:20.193 --> 01:14:22.904
Yeah.

01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:43.841
- Now what?
- Bumps. Rough ones.

01:14:44.092 --> 01:14:45.927
- Railroad tracks.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:14:46.177 --> 01:14:50.431
A right on Antrim and a left on 84.

01:14:50.682 --> 01:14:54.602
And then what did you hear?

01:14:54.644 --> 01:14:58.815
- A cocktail party.
- What?

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:03.027
Drove through what sounded...

01:15:03.277 --> 01:15:07.407
It sounded like a cocktail party.

01:15:07.657 --> 01:15:09.659
There was chattering.
It was right at the end.

01:15:09.909 --> 01:15:12.245
Great. Now we got to look
for a cocktail party...

01:15:12.495 --> 01:15:14.372
on the other side of the railroad track.

01:15:14.622 --> 01:15:17.875
What's the exit
where the railroad tracks are?

01:15:18.126 --> 01:15:18.835
Crescent.

01:15:19.085 --> 01:15:21.629
Mother, stay on Crescent,
get off at the reservoir.

01:15:21.879 --> 01:15:23.881
Okay.

01:15:24.132 --> 01:15:27.593
There's a cocktail party at the reservoir?

01:15:27.844 --> 01:15:32.765
Yeah. Yeah.

01:15:34.809 --> 01:15:40.189
Very good, Bish. Remind me to make you
an honorary blind person.

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:43.359
Great.

01:15:44.110 --> 01:15:47.488
Where's this road go?

01:15:47.739 --> 01:15:51.826
Nowhere. Looks like it ends
right around that hill.

01:15:52.076 --> 01:15:57.665
- What's behind the hill?
- Nothing. It's private property.

01:15:59.417 --> 01:16:02.545
Private.

01:16:30.239 --> 01:16:33.701
Forget it. It's a toy company.

01:16:33.951 --> 01:16:36.746
Toy company, my ass. That's laser fencing.

01:16:36.996 --> 01:16:41.542
There's high voltage on the perimeter.
The whole building says "go away".

01:16:41.793 --> 01:16:45.963
It's Cosmo. I know it.
The toy company's a front.

01:16:46.214 --> 01:16:51.219
Mother, get the directional.
Carl, get the video. Let's go.

01:16:55.431 --> 01:17:00.687
- Second floor, northwest two.
- That's a bathroom.

01:17:01.312 --> 01:17:04.691
Second floor, northwest three.

01:17:04.941 --> 01:17:08.486
- That's an emergency exit.
- How do you know that?

01:17:08.736 --> 01:17:13.783
I can hear the emergency
floodlight batteries recharging.

01:17:15.118 --> 01:17:17.870
Hold it right there.
Crease, what's this mean?

01:17:18.121 --> 01:17:20.832
"My voice is my passport. Verify me."

01:17:21.082 --> 01:17:25.586
Some sort of voiceprint ID.
I'll check it out.

01:17:29.215 --> 01:17:33.845
- What am I listening to now, Mother?
- Third floor, southwest corner.

01:17:34.095 --> 01:17:36.639
It's bursting with ultrasonic.

01:17:36.889 --> 01:17:40.018
I've never heard sensors
that powerful before.

01:17:40.268 --> 01:17:44.856
Bish, someone is very serious
about keeping people out of that room.

01:17:45.106 --> 01:17:47.942
Yeah.

01:17:57.410 --> 01:17:58.661
There's the corner room...

01:17:58.911 --> 01:18:01.080
with the motion detectors
Whistler heard.

01:18:01.331 --> 01:18:03.458
That's Cosmo's office. I saw the sensors.

01:18:03.708 --> 01:18:05.293
They keep the lights on all night...

01:18:05.543 --> 01:18:10.131
so we must assume sensors are on, too.
It won't be easy getting in there.

01:18:10.381 --> 01:18:15.136
Run this on ahead.
Let's figure out who works next door.

01:18:16.846 --> 01:18:20.433
It's fascinating what $50 can get you
at the county recorder's office.

01:18:20.683 --> 01:18:24.103
- What do you got?
- PlayTronics' corporate headquarters.

01:18:24.354 --> 01:18:27.065
- The complete blueprints.
- Not bad.

01:18:27.315 --> 01:18:30.735
- Not bad, Carl.
- Thanks.

01:18:30.985 --> 01:18:32.195
Where'd you get the $50?

01:18:32.445 --> 01:18:36.157
- I took it from Mother's wallet.
- Good.

01:18:36.407 --> 01:18:40.578
No, Mom, today's not a good day
to come over.

01:18:40.995 --> 01:18:42.789
Okay, what have we got here?

01:18:43.039 --> 01:18:46.668
It's called a Man-Trap. I borrowed
this demo from the manufacturer.

01:18:46.918 --> 01:18:50.672
It's a digital voice-recognition monitor
hooked up to an access booth.

01:18:50.922 --> 01:18:58.221
NSA uses this to keep people out of
restricted areas at Fort Meade. Card?

01:19:01.849 --> 01:19:05.978
- Now speak right into this box.
- Hi.

01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:08.523
My name is Martin Bishop.

01:19:08.773 --> 01:19:12.735
My voice is my passport. Verify me.

01:19:13.986 --> 01:19:15.196
You can't pass through...

01:19:15.446 --> 01:19:18.282
unless your voiceprint matches
the one encoded on the card.

01:19:18.533 --> 01:19:21.536
- So we need someone's card.
- And their voice.

01:19:21.786 --> 01:19:25.081
- Can we beat this with tape?
- Has to be up close and personal.

01:19:25.331 --> 01:19:28.084
Otherwise you'll be caught
in a steel-reinforced booth...

01:19:28.334 --> 01:19:30.712
while the guards
with the shotguns are called.

01:19:30.962 --> 01:19:31.962
That's great.

01:19:32.130 --> 01:19:33.673
What about motion detectors?

01:19:33.923 --> 01:19:35.508
I'm picking one up this afternoon.

01:19:35.758 --> 01:19:40.054
That makes beating this look easy.

01:19:40.304 --> 01:19:43.641
Hey, Bish, I think we've found our guy.

01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:47.687
Okay, I've blown up the image a little.
Here's the room next to Cosmo's.

01:19:47.937 --> 01:19:51.315
Now it's the end of the day.
Watch who comes out.

01:19:51.566 --> 01:19:54.485
Let me zoom in on the front door.

01:19:54.736 --> 01:19:57.363
A lady in a green skirt...

01:19:57.613 --> 01:19:59.907
and this guy with the cap.

01:20:00.158 --> 01:20:02.535
Nobody comes out for another 18 minutes.

01:20:02.785 --> 01:20:04.329
- So it's one of those two.
- Right.

01:20:04.579 --> 01:20:08.249
Here's the next evening. Again...

01:20:08.499 --> 01:20:13.296
the office next to Cosmo's.
Lights go out.

01:20:15.298 --> 01:20:17.342
The guy in the cap. Anybody else?

01:20:17.592 --> 01:20:21.471
Nobody else comes out for 22 minutes.
That's who works next door.

01:20:21.721 --> 01:20:25.475
We'll use his office to get into Cosmo's.
Can we get plates?

01:20:25.725 --> 01:20:28.436
Let me see.

01:20:29.896 --> 01:20:32.648
Zooming in.

01:20:32.899 --> 01:20:37.153
Another bump. Enhancing.

01:20:37.695 --> 01:20:42.200
There's your plate. 180 IQ.

01:20:43.076 --> 01:20:48.206
Cute. All right, Carl, let's do this guy.

01:20:48.456 --> 01:20:50.583
His name's Werner Brandes.

01:20:50.833 --> 01:20:54.045
Single, 6'1", 174 pounds,
must wear glasses to drive...

01:20:54.295 --> 01:20:56.673
no outstanding tickets or warrants.

01:20:56.923 --> 01:20:59.759
He leaves work
between 6:00 and 7:00 every night...

01:21:00.009 --> 01:21:02.553
takes the same route home,
obeys the speed limit...

01:21:02.804 --> 01:21:07.058
comes to a complete stop at every stop
sign and signals when he changes lanes.

01:21:07.308 --> 01:21:09.727
He's a very safe driver.

01:21:09.977 --> 01:21:14.107
$750 limit on his Visa, pays his bills.

01:21:14.357 --> 01:21:16.609
No bad debts, no bum checks.

01:21:16.859 --> 01:21:21.155
No firearms. Member, International
Microchip Designers Association...

01:21:21.406 --> 01:21:23.825
and chairman of the social committee.

01:21:24.075 --> 01:21:26.995
Great. The world's most boring human.

01:21:27.245 --> 01:21:32.250
How the hell are we going to get
close enough to record him?

01:21:33.251 --> 01:21:36.421
Oh, Mother.

01:21:36.546 --> 01:21:41.759
Sorry, Liz. Standard procedure.
Trash from the guy's house.

01:21:41.801 --> 01:21:46.055
And thank you for bringing it into mine.

01:21:48.808 --> 01:21:52.270
Okay, let's see here.
Phone bill, no long distance.

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:56.149
Club Med brochure.

01:21:56.482 --> 01:22:00.653
A ticket stub to a Barry Manilow concert.

01:22:01.904 --> 01:22:04.240
Here it is. Here we go.

01:22:04.490 --> 01:22:09.704
"Dear Compudater: Welcome to
the world of automated compatibility."

01:22:09.954 --> 01:22:13.416
- He's a computer dater.
- I love it. Let's get him a date.

01:22:13.666 --> 01:22:17.295
What was the name of that gal we used
on the cereal company sneak last year?

01:22:17.545 --> 01:22:20.381
Sandy Krieger? Forget it. Married a cop.

01:22:20.631 --> 01:22:24.635
How about Barbara? Now, she was cute.

01:22:24.886 --> 01:22:27.930
Yeah, but she'd never do it.
She regards this work as juvenile.

01:22:28.181 --> 01:22:31.476
That's why she divorced me.
How about your friend Jessie?

01:22:31.726 --> 01:22:34.354
- Yeah, she's buff.
- Fellas.

01:22:34.604 --> 01:22:40.109
Fellas, look at this man's trash.
He's not looking for buff.

01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:42.612
It's the nicest garbage I've ever seen.

01:22:42.862 --> 01:22:44.906
The man who folded this tube of Crest...

01:22:45.156 --> 01:22:50.870
is looking for someone meticulous,
refined, anal.

01:22:55.875 --> 01:22:58.670
What?

01:23:17.772 --> 01:23:20.191
Werner? Hi.

01:23:20.441 --> 01:23:22.902
I'm Doris.

01:23:23.152 --> 01:23:25.530
Hi.

01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:27.865
Are you ready for the dim sum bar?

01:23:28.116 --> 01:23:30.410
I'm not really in any hurry.

01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:34.622
All right. I'll be right back.

01:23:58.855 --> 01:24:01.649
So.

01:24:01.899 --> 01:24:05.278
What an interesting name you have.

01:24:05.528 --> 01:24:09.157
How exactly do you pronounce it?

01:24:17.457 --> 01:24:21.169
This is what's in Cosmo's office.

01:24:24.172 --> 01:24:26.507
The best motion sensor on the market.

01:24:26.758 --> 01:24:29.886
Watch this.

01:24:31.137 --> 01:24:34.349
It also responds to thermal differentials.

01:24:34.599 --> 01:24:36.309
Does this have a happy ending?

01:24:36.559 --> 01:24:40.355
We can wrap you in a full body suit
of neoprene, heat-resistant rubber...

01:24:40.605 --> 01:24:43.608
or raise the temperature
in Cosmo's office to 98.6 degrees...

01:24:43.858 --> 01:24:47.236
which is probably what we'll do.
The neoprene would suffocate you.

01:24:47.487 --> 01:24:49.947
Either way, you've got a top speed of...

01:24:50.198 --> 01:24:53.368
two inches per second.

01:24:53.618 --> 01:24:56.162
Any faster than that...

01:24:56.412 --> 01:24:58.581
and big guys with guns.

01:24:58.831 --> 01:25:01.959
- You'll probably do fine.
- Since when am I the one...

01:25:02.210 --> 01:25:05.338
This is the same answering machine
Janek used for his box.

01:25:05.588 --> 01:25:09.092
That's what you'll be carrying
across the floor at two inches per second.

01:25:09.342 --> 01:25:13.388
I got that for you because I figured
you'd just want to practice with it.

01:25:13.638 --> 01:25:16.224
Remember to go real slow!

01:25:16.474 --> 01:25:19.018
Slow.

01:25:20.687 --> 01:25:24.649
You get all the fun stuff.

01:25:41.666 --> 01:25:43.459
So, what about travel?

01:25:43.710 --> 01:25:47.588
Where do you like to go?
Europe? Mexico?

01:25:47.839 --> 01:25:50.258
I don't know.
I've never been out of the country.

01:25:50.508 --> 01:25:52.093
I think they want us to leave.

01:25:52.343 --> 01:25:55.304
Sit down, Werner.

01:25:56.431 --> 01:25:57.932
Talk to me.

01:25:58.182 --> 01:26:03.104
You know what?
I really love the sound of your voice.

01:26:03.354 --> 01:26:04.981
Really?

01:26:05.231 --> 01:26:08.276
I always thought it was kind of nasal
and pinched.

01:26:08.526 --> 01:26:10.737
No, not at all. It's lovely.

01:26:10.987 --> 01:26:14.490
And there's this one word.

01:26:14.741 --> 01:26:18.911
I've always loved the sound of this word.

01:26:19.162 --> 01:26:21.080
- Oh, no!
- No, what? What?

01:26:21.331 --> 01:26:24.500
- You wouldn't. Never mind.
- I would. What? What, please?

01:26:24.751 --> 01:26:26.586
All right.

01:26:26.836 --> 01:26:32.759
I would really like to hear you
say the word...

01:26:33.009 --> 01:26:35.970
"passport".

01:26:38.598 --> 01:26:41.225
Passport?

01:26:44.395 --> 01:26:46.939
You know, you're right. We ought to leave.

01:26:47.190 --> 01:26:50.068
Doris?

01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:53.613
Would you like to have breakfast with me?

01:26:53.863 --> 01:26:56.240
Sure, fine.

01:26:56.491 --> 01:27:00.203
Shall I phone you or nudge you?

01:27:01.788 --> 01:27:04.540
Check, please.

01:27:13.925 --> 01:27:17.178
<i>Hi. My name is Werner Brandes.</i>

01:27:17.428 --> 01:27:22.475
<i>My voice is my passport.
Verify me. Thank you.</i>

01:27:43.079 --> 01:27:46.624
Is that the gardener?
I thought they already left.

01:27:46.874 --> 01:27:49.836
I guess not.

01:27:58.678 --> 01:28:02.473
May I use your john, please?

01:29:10.917 --> 01:29:15.088
Listen, a few minutes ago,
a gardener came...

01:29:17.256 --> 01:29:20.301
Skip it. I see him.

01:29:25.973 --> 01:29:27.433
Okay, fellas, I'm outta here.

01:29:27.684 --> 01:29:31.896
Carl, have a nice ride.

01:30:09.142 --> 01:30:12.103
It's hot in here.

01:30:12.770 --> 01:30:16.065
Maybe I'll just open this window a bit.

01:30:16.315 --> 01:30:21.321
I'll join you as soon as I'm through
pounding these breasts.

01:30:21.904 --> 01:30:24.782
Do you know,
the best thing about this meal...

01:30:25.033 --> 01:30:28.202
besides it's absolutely fabulous...

01:30:28.453 --> 01:30:30.830
is that it only has 400 calories.
- Oh, great.

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:33.291
- I'm concerned about what we eat.
- You are.

01:30:33.541 --> 01:30:37.003
What would you say is the ideal diet?

01:30:37.253 --> 01:30:40.631
I sort of eat on the run.

01:30:40.882 --> 01:30:41.966
I'm really busy, so...

01:30:42.216 --> 01:30:47.263
The ideal diet, don't laugh,
is the bottom of a monkey cage.

01:30:47.513 --> 01:30:51.184
- I'm sorry?
- Look at the bottom of a monkey cage.

01:30:51.434 --> 01:30:53.644
Is someone answering your door?

01:30:53.895 --> 01:30:57.982
Just a second. I'm not expecting anyone.

01:31:00.443 --> 01:31:03.529
No. Nobody there.

01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:07.200
- I'm sorry.
- We're all alone.

01:31:07.450 --> 01:31:11.996
I'll just close the window. It's okay now.

01:31:12.031 --> 01:31:13.456
It's true. I read that once.

01:31:13.706 --> 01:31:15.708
I don't know.
What were we talking about?

01:31:15.958 --> 01:31:20.338
You have fruit, greens...

01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:26.219
Good evening. PlayTronics.

01:31:51.327 --> 01:31:52.620
Cattle mutilations are up.

01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:56.916
- Don't.
- Sorry.

01:32:23.901 --> 01:32:25.361
Here we go.

01:32:25.611 --> 01:32:28.364
Martin, we've got video. All eight of them.

01:32:28.614 --> 01:32:30.283
You're coming in fine.

01:32:30.533 --> 01:32:34.704
You are clear all the way up
to the Man-Trap.

01:33:10.073 --> 01:33:13.242
<i>Hi, my name is Werner Brandes.</i>

01:33:13.493 --> 01:33:18.039
<i>My voice is my passport. Verify me.</i>

01:34:50.882 --> 01:34:54.427
There's a three-foot area in the corner,
just outside the sensor's range.

01:34:54.677 --> 01:34:57.221
Good. Hold on. Whistler?

01:34:57.472 --> 01:35:01.976
- Carl, how's the weather?
- 98.6 and holding.

01:35:02.226 --> 01:35:06.189
Beauty. We got body temp, Crease.

01:35:06.439 --> 01:35:08.941
Go.

01:35:29.212 --> 01:35:32.256
Once again, I am so sorry about dinner.

01:35:32.507 --> 01:35:34.342
No, it was really delicious.

01:35:34.592 --> 01:35:37.762
No, no. I overcooked the carrots.

01:35:38.012 --> 01:35:42.975
No, I liked them really squishy like that.

01:35:43.226 --> 01:35:46.270
- That's cute.
- Watch.

01:35:46.521 --> 01:35:49.357
Watch this.

01:35:52.735 --> 01:35:55.655
Play dead.

01:35:56.739 --> 01:35:58.324
Great!

01:35:58.574 --> 01:36:01.077
I designed the voice recognition chip.

01:36:01.327 --> 01:36:03.204
What a thing to do!

01:36:03.454 --> 01:36:06.749
- Could I just make a quick phone call?
- Sure.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:10.128
- It's in the bedroom.
- Upstairs?

01:36:10.378 --> 01:36:14.882
Yeah, just go upstairs
and then walk straight forward.

01:36:15.133 --> 01:36:19.303
The first one is a closet.

01:36:20.054 --> 01:36:21.597
Pooch.

01:36:21.848 --> 01:36:25.977
Look what you've done to Doris' purse.

01:36:56.549 --> 01:37:01.304
What do you say we go for a ride, Doris?

01:37:18.571 --> 01:37:20.406
I don't believe this!

01:37:20.657 --> 01:37:22.950
What are you saying?
The NSA killed Kennedy?

01:37:23.201 --> 01:37:27.455
No, they shot him, but they didn't
kill him. He's still alive.

01:37:27.705 --> 01:37:29.666
That's it. I've had it.

01:37:29.916 --> 01:37:31.876
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

01:37:32.126 --> 01:37:36.047
- Do your job. I don't want to talk.
- Okay, fine.

01:37:36.297 --> 01:37:40.468
It was the same people
who framed Pete Rose.

01:37:41.219 --> 01:37:44.514
Boy, this was fun. Wanna go back?

01:37:44.764 --> 01:37:49.477
- No, we're almost there.
- Almost where?

01:37:54.524 --> 01:37:56.609
- Forget it. Forget it.
- No, Crease.

01:37:56.859 --> 01:38:01.072
Werner just pulled up.
He's got Liz with him.

01:38:02.573 --> 01:38:07.787
Martin? I think you'd better hurry.

01:38:10.164 --> 01:38:15.169
The one thing I can't do is hurry.

01:38:38.818 --> 01:38:40.945
"I want you to say it
for me just one time."

01:38:41.195 --> 01:38:44.324
"Passport.
You have such a beautiful voice."

01:38:44.574 --> 01:38:46.200
I'm Dr. Brandes. I work on three.

01:38:46.451 --> 01:38:49.829
I believe this phony is involved
in some plot to break into my office.

01:38:50.079 --> 01:38:55.001
Hold it! Hold it!
Let me see your entry card.

01:38:55.251 --> 01:38:59.422
- You took my card.
- What card? See?

01:38:59.672 --> 01:39:02.717
Sir, we have a problem.

01:39:25.281 --> 01:39:29.202
- What?
- Call the police.

01:39:30.745 --> 01:39:34.207
I think that someone
is trying to break into my office!

01:39:34.457 --> 01:39:38.086
Let's take a look at his office.

01:40:22.213 --> 01:40:24.590
Well?

01:40:24.841 --> 01:40:27.802
Well, everything seems to be in order.

01:40:28.052 --> 01:40:31.222
- Does it?
- Yes, sir.

01:40:33.808 --> 01:40:37.437
- Very sorry to have troubled you, miss.
- Not as sorry as I am.

01:40:37.687 --> 01:40:40.773
Werner.

01:40:47.113 --> 01:40:49.615
They're letting her go.

01:40:49.866 --> 01:40:52.410
- We'll call you a cab.
- Thank you.

01:40:52.660 --> 01:40:56.456
This is my last computer date.

01:40:57.332 --> 01:41:00.293
Wait.

01:41:00.710 --> 01:41:06.007
A computer matched her with him?
I don't think so.

01:41:09.344 --> 01:41:12.513
Marty.

01:41:20.188 --> 01:41:23.816
Why is it so hot in here?

01:41:32.533 --> 01:41:35.995
Marty!

01:41:41.918 --> 01:41:44.003
We've got six guards in the front lobby...

01:41:44.253 --> 01:41:47.006
four in the south corridor,
five upstairs north.

01:41:47.256 --> 01:41:49.676
- Guards in the boiler room.
- Oh, God.

01:41:49.926 --> 01:41:53.304
Carl, listen carefully. You've got trouble.

01:41:53.554 --> 01:41:55.306
Heating duct's over the furnace.

01:41:55.556 --> 01:41:58.476
You'll be all right.
Find the heating ducts above the furnace.

01:41:58.726 --> 01:42:01.145
That'll lead you to the elevator.

01:42:01.396 --> 01:42:03.856
There's a fire escape
at the end of the north corridor.

01:42:04.107 --> 01:42:06.401
- There are fire walls.
- Have him go south.

01:42:06.651 --> 01:42:10.363
No, go directly north, 30 yards.

01:42:10.613 --> 01:42:12.490
Once you're there, let me know.

01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:16.035
Blue team, move to corridor one.
Green team, secure north corridor.

01:42:16.285 --> 01:42:21.416
He'll be in a crawl space. Break through.

01:42:34.262 --> 01:42:35.471
Crease?

01:42:35.722 --> 01:42:38.016
I'm in northeast three, over the corridor.

01:42:38.266 --> 01:42:41.769
<i>- I think it's a dead end.
- Don't move.</i>

01:42:42.020 --> 01:42:43.938
Don't worry, we'll get you out of there.

01:42:44.188 --> 01:42:49.485
We've got guards at every stairwell.
Can you hear if there's any...

01:42:54.490 --> 01:42:56.200
Oh, no.

01:42:56.451 --> 01:43:00.413
What? Don't say "oh, no".

01:43:03.541 --> 01:43:04.541
This is Wallace.

01:43:04.709 --> 01:43:09.005
I'm in northeast three.
I'm gonna check it out.

01:43:10.423 --> 01:43:13.468
Martin, we lost...

01:43:20.099 --> 01:43:23.144
Do you read me?

01:43:33.196 --> 01:43:35.615
Damn!

01:43:39.118 --> 01:43:42.080
<i>Stop shooting.</i>

01:43:42.455 --> 01:43:45.166
Marty?

01:43:45.416 --> 01:43:47.710
I know you are in the building...

01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:51.547
<i>and I know you can hear me.</i>

01:43:51.589 --> 01:43:54.008
<i>God.</i>

01:43:55.051 --> 01:43:58.596
<i>You should not have come back, Marty.</i>

01:43:58.846 --> 01:44:01.474
<i>I won and you lost.</i>

01:44:01.724 --> 01:44:05.561
<i>If our friendship meant anything to you,
that's the way you should have left it.</i>

01:44:05.812 --> 01:44:09.732
<i>But you always had to be
the one to win, didn't you?</i>

01:44:09.983 --> 01:44:15.029
<i>You were the one who got away
with things, while I never did.</i>

01:44:15.238 --> 01:44:20.868
<i>You always had to get the girl, didn't you?</i>

01:44:24.288 --> 01:44:27.250
So I never did...

01:44:29.627 --> 01:44:32.964
at least not until now.

01:44:36.926 --> 01:44:40.013
She's lovely, Marty.

01:44:43.599 --> 01:44:45.893
<i>Please.</i>

01:44:46.144 --> 01:44:49.981
Marty, please bring me the box.

01:44:50.773 --> 01:44:52.233
<i>You must know...</i>

01:44:52.483 --> 01:44:57.238
<i>they will never let either of you live
if you try to get out.</i>

01:44:57.488 --> 01:45:00.491
<i>I am your way out.</i>

01:45:01.326 --> 01:45:04.704
I'm your only way out.

01:45:06.039 --> 01:45:09.417
<i>If I wanted you dead...</i>

01:45:09.709 --> 01:45:12.712
<i>you'd be dead.</i>

01:45:12.837 --> 01:45:14.714
<i>Marty...</i>

01:45:14.964 --> 01:45:18.134
I cannot kill you.

01:45:18.968 --> 01:45:21.971
I cannot kill you.

01:45:24.724 --> 01:45:28.186
You have to trust me.

01:45:31.522 --> 01:45:34.859
Guys, I'm goin' in.

01:45:35.068 --> 01:45:38.196
Do you hear me, Carl?

01:45:39.238 --> 01:45:41.783
Yes.

01:46:03.471 --> 01:46:04.222
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:46:04.472 --> 01:46:08.976
- How are you?
- Fine. How are you?

01:46:12.855 --> 01:46:15.900
So you have my box.

01:46:20.154 --> 01:46:22.949
We have a deal.

01:46:23.032 --> 01:46:26.285
Right?

01:46:29.831 --> 01:46:31.332
Wait a second.

01:46:31.582 --> 01:46:34.419
Wait a minute!

01:46:34.627 --> 01:46:38.339
Goddamn it, you gave me your word!

01:46:46.556 --> 01:46:49.767
I cannot kill my friend.

01:46:52.103 --> 01:46:55.356
Kill my friend.

01:46:58.276 --> 01:47:00.069
You son of a bitch.

01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:04.657
You didn't really think we were gonna
let you go, did you?

01:47:04.907 --> 01:47:08.536
You didn't really think I was gonna
let you have this box, did you?

01:47:08.786 --> 01:47:11.331
- What?
- Now.

01:47:11.581 --> 01:47:14.459
Now? What are you talking about now?

01:47:14.709 --> 01:47:19.297
- Now!
- You're damn right, now!

01:47:19.547 --> 01:47:23.092
- Carl, now!
- Geronimo!

01:47:29.223 --> 01:47:32.268
Let go of him.

01:47:34.103 --> 01:47:36.230
I mean it. I'm an excellent marksman.

01:47:36.481 --> 01:47:39.859
Woman! Move!

01:47:40.109 --> 01:47:43.446
Sure. Sure.

01:47:45.114 --> 01:47:48.242
Get up.

01:47:55.333 --> 01:47:59.045
- What the hell were you waiting for?
- That's not easy, what I just did.

01:47:59.295 --> 01:48:03.007
- Guys, could we get out of here?
- Yeah.

01:48:03.675 --> 01:48:06.260
Here.

01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:10.973
- Up, up, up!
- I'm up!

01:48:11.224 --> 01:48:13.851
Hurry!

01:48:20.566 --> 01:48:25.863
Crease, we're on the roof. There's
a fire escape on the side. Is it clear?

01:48:26.114 --> 01:48:28.950
Yes, clear.

01:48:30.451 --> 01:48:31.703
Where are you?

01:48:31.953 --> 01:48:34.580
<i>On a hill overlooking
the northeast corner of the lot.</i>

01:48:34.831 --> 01:48:38.334
- There!
- Beautiful. Come and get us.

01:48:38.584 --> 01:48:43.840
Hurry up. We've only got a few minutes
before anybody knows we're gone.

01:48:44.340 --> 01:48:47.802
Comin' to get you.

01:48:49.762 --> 01:48:54.642
Put your hands where
I can see 'em and step outta the van.

01:48:54.809 --> 01:48:57.979
You too, Midnight.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:23.379
Bish, they've got Crease and Mother.

01:49:24.213 --> 01:49:26.966
Shit!

01:49:28.509 --> 01:49:31.387
Whistler, you've got to do it.

01:49:31.637 --> 01:49:32.637
Do what?

01:49:32.847 --> 01:49:37.185
You gotta drive.
I'll talk you through it. Now, hurry.

01:49:37.435 --> 01:49:40.271
Drive what?

01:49:57.997 --> 01:49:59.165
Okay, Bish.

01:49:59.415 --> 01:50:01.459
There's a gate about 30 yards behind you.

01:50:01.709 --> 01:50:05.338
<i>Put it in reverse and floor it.</i>

01:50:05.713 --> 01:50:09.300
Did I ever tell you
why I had to leave the CIA?

01:50:09.550 --> 01:50:12.178
No.

01:50:15.973 --> 01:50:17.850
What's reverse?

01:50:18.101 --> 01:50:19.977
One down.

01:50:20.228 --> 01:50:23.481
My temper.

01:50:28.361 --> 01:50:31.197
Mess with me, I'll split your head!

01:50:31.447 --> 01:50:36.953
Crease, where's Whistler going?

01:50:37.328 --> 01:50:40.164
Bish? I'm going backwards.

01:50:40.415 --> 01:50:44.377
You're doin' fine. Doin' fine.

01:50:45.878 --> 01:50:47.672
Now, hit the brakes!

01:50:47.922 --> 01:50:50.591
Now!

01:50:51.050 --> 01:50:54.178
Okay, put the gearshift down two notches.

01:50:54.429 --> 01:50:58.391
Down two notches.

01:50:58.474 --> 01:51:02.061
<i>Turn left. Floor it.</i>

01:51:02.312 --> 01:51:07.275
- I'm going forward.
- Straighten out.

01:51:08.401 --> 01:51:12.697
- What was that?
- Okay, keep comin'.

01:51:12.947 --> 01:51:16.659
Oh, God, I'm driving!

01:51:19.829 --> 01:51:23.916
No, don't do that. I'm driving!

01:51:25.335 --> 01:51:27.795
Go left!

01:51:28.046 --> 01:51:30.256
My left. Right.

01:51:30.506 --> 01:51:34.010
Go right! Right!

01:51:37.013 --> 01:51:40.183
It's okay.

01:51:41.476 --> 01:51:44.103
Beautiful! Keep comin'. Keep comin'.

01:51:44.354 --> 01:51:48.483
Now, you're gonna go down
a very gentle slope.

01:51:48.733 --> 01:51:52.320
Okay, fine. Great. No problem.

01:51:58.242 --> 01:52:00.370
Doin' okay. Five more seconds...

01:52:00.620 --> 01:52:03.539
and stop.

01:52:06.584 --> 01:52:10.338
I think I'll stop right here.

01:52:11.047 --> 01:52:13.007
Whistler, that was great!

01:52:13.257 --> 01:52:15.051
- Whistler!
- That was great!

01:52:15.301 --> 01:52:17.804
I'm taking the wheel. In the back.

01:52:18.054 --> 01:52:21.140
Where's Martin?

01:52:23.309 --> 01:52:26.312
Marty.

01:52:28.272 --> 01:52:32.068
Would you step away from the ladder?

01:52:49.502 --> 01:52:51.838
You will give me the box right now...

01:52:52.088 --> 01:52:55.800
or I will kill you right now.

01:52:59.095 --> 01:53:01.806
No.

01:53:02.932 --> 01:53:04.017
Jesus!

01:53:04.267 --> 01:53:06.811
Just give me the box, Marty.

01:53:07.061 --> 01:53:09.647
- I thought you couldn't kill me.
- I missed on purpose!

01:53:09.897 --> 01:53:13.693
- Now give me the box.
- Take the damn thing! I don't want it.

01:53:13.943 --> 01:53:16.571
You win, I lose.
That's what you want, isn't it?

01:53:16.821 --> 01:53:20.325
- Say it! Say it!
- Yes.

01:53:25.163 --> 01:53:26.456
I'm sorry, Cos.

01:53:26.706 --> 01:53:28.791
- You could have shared this with me.
- I know.

01:53:29.042 --> 01:53:31.794
- You could have had the power.
- I don't want it.

01:53:32.045 --> 01:53:34.297
Don't you know the places
we can go with this?

01:53:34.547 --> 01:53:38.676
- Yeah, I do. There's nobody there.
- Exactly.

01:53:38.926 --> 01:53:41.929
The world isn't run by weapons anymore,
or energy or money.

01:53:42.180 --> 01:53:46.059
It's run by ones and zeroes, little
bits of data. It's all just electrons.

01:53:46.309 --> 01:53:48.311
I don't care.

01:53:48.561 --> 01:53:51.064
I don't expect other people
to understand this...

01:53:51.314 --> 01:53:54.067
but I do expect you to understand this.

01:53:54.317 --> 01:53:56.778
We started this journey together.

01:53:57.028 --> 01:54:00.323
It wasn't a journey, Cos.

01:54:00.782 --> 01:54:02.909
It was a prank.

01:54:03.159 --> 01:54:06.329
There's a war out there,
old friend, a world war.

01:54:06.579 --> 01:54:08.748
And it's not about
who's got the most bullets.

01:54:08.998 --> 01:54:10.917
It's about who controls the information:

01:54:11.167 --> 01:54:13.961
what we see and hear,
how we work, what we think.

01:54:14.212 --> 01:54:17.215
It's all about the information.

01:54:17.465 --> 01:54:21.386
If I were you, I'd destroy that thing.

01:54:22.428 --> 01:54:25.056
Don't go.

01:54:28.977 --> 01:54:31.813
Don't go.

01:54:35.817 --> 01:54:39.445
You do what you have to do, Cos.

01:54:39.529 --> 01:54:41.656
But if you want to stop me...

01:54:41.906 --> 01:54:45.660
you'll have to pull the trigger.

01:54:46.244 --> 01:54:49.080
You.

01:55:40.715 --> 01:55:43.343
I can't believe we actually made it back.

01:55:43.593 --> 01:55:47.430
I can't believe we did the greatest sneak
in history and can't tell anybody.

01:55:47.680 --> 01:55:50.850
You know what I can't believe?
Tomorrow's Thursday!

01:55:51.100 --> 01:55:53.853
- Not one word.
- All of you, step over here.

01:55:54.103 --> 01:55:56.272
Hands over your head. Move!

01:55:56.522 --> 01:55:59.275
Move!

01:56:00.902 --> 01:56:03.863
Mr. Bishop.

01:56:10.328 --> 01:56:15.333
I'm Bernard Abbott,
National Security Agency.

01:56:15.583 --> 01:56:18.252
We spoke on the phone.

01:56:18.503 --> 01:56:23.841
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:28.137
It's interesting, don't
you think, you guys...

01:56:28.388 --> 01:56:31.057
that the NSA is here?

01:56:31.307 --> 01:56:34.143
I thought the FBI was supposed
to do this kind of thing.

01:56:34.394 --> 01:56:37.855
Absolutely. This is outside
the NSA's jurisdiction.

01:56:38.106 --> 01:56:42.735
Unless the NSA didn't want anybody
to know about Janek's little black box.

01:56:42.986 --> 01:56:45.571
I keep thinking
about something Greg told me.

01:56:45.822 --> 01:56:48.825
He said our codes were based
on an entirely different system...

01:56:49.075 --> 01:56:54.455
than the Russian codes,
so this box really wouldn't work on them.

01:56:54.706 --> 01:56:57.625
The only thing it would be good for
is spying on Americans.

01:56:57.875 --> 01:57:01.004
Sure, with a box like that
they could read the FBI's mail.

01:57:01.254 --> 01:57:04.757
- Or the CIA's.
- Or the White House's.

01:57:05.008 --> 01:57:09.929
No wonder they don't want
to share with the other children.

01:57:09.964 --> 01:57:13.057
What do you want, Mr. Bishop?

01:57:13.307 --> 01:57:15.852
Clear up my record.

01:57:16.102 --> 01:57:19.480
- Get outta my life.
- I don't have much choice, do I?

01:57:19.731 --> 01:57:24.152
Not unless you wanna read
about it in "Newsweek".

01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:28.781
- Deal. The box.
- Not so fast.

01:57:30.616 --> 01:57:33.286
- I want a Winnebago.
- What?

01:57:33.536 --> 01:57:35.705
Fully equipped, big kitchen, water bed...

01:57:35.955 --> 01:57:37.915
AM-FM, CD, microwave.

01:57:38.166 --> 01:57:39.876
This is not a car dealership, pal.

01:57:40.126 --> 01:57:43.296
He wants a Winnebago.

01:57:47.216 --> 01:57:49.385
All right, a Winnebago.

01:57:49.635 --> 01:57:53.556
Thank you. Burgundy interior.

01:57:53.806 --> 01:57:56.559
Now the box.

01:57:56.684 --> 01:58:00.938
I have never taken my wife to Europe.

01:58:01.189 --> 01:58:04.025
I'm sorry to hear it. Give me the box.

01:58:04.275 --> 01:58:08.863
You will buy me two round-trip,
first-class tickets to Athens...

01:58:09.113 --> 01:58:13.076
Lisbon, Madrid and Scotland.

01:58:13.326 --> 01:58:16.579
- Don't forget Tahiti.
- And Tahiti.

01:58:16.829 --> 01:58:19.916
- Tahiti is not in Europe.
- Excuse me.

01:58:20.166 --> 01:58:22.335
When you get the box,
give us geography lessons.

01:58:22.585 --> 01:58:26.172
Until then, this man goes to Tahiti.

01:58:26.339 --> 01:58:30.385
Fine! Tahiti!

01:58:31.219 --> 01:58:33.346
Carl?

01:58:33.596 --> 01:58:38.059
The young lady with the Uzi, is she single?

01:58:38.309 --> 01:58:41.270
Carl. Excuse us.

01:58:42.730 --> 01:58:46.943
This is the brass ring.
You gotta think bigger thoughts.

01:58:47.193 --> 01:58:50.905
I just want her telephone number.

01:58:52.156 --> 01:58:54.951
Please.

01:58:56.452 --> 01:58:58.830
- How about a lunch? You can chaperon.
- No.

01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:03.459
- I will not do this.
- Abby, come on.

01:59:03.710 --> 01:59:06.337
- The FBI'd give him twins.
- No!

01:59:06.587 --> 01:59:09.382
Wait a second.

01:59:10.383 --> 01:59:15.930
You can have anything you want,
and you're asking for my phone number?

01:59:16.055 --> 01:59:18.891
Yes.

01:59:18.933 --> 01:59:21.936
273-9164...

01:59:22.186 --> 01:59:25.989
area code 415.

01:59:26.024 --> 01:59:28.151
- I'm Carl.
- I'm Mary.

01:59:28.401 --> 01:59:30.236
I'm going to be sick.

01:59:30.486 --> 01:59:34.657
- Are we done here?
- Not yet. Whistler.

01:59:36.993 --> 01:59:39.996
I want peace on earth
and goodwill toward men.

01:59:40.246 --> 01:59:42.832
- This is ridiculous.
- He's serious.

01:59:43.082 --> 01:59:45.418
I want peace on earth
and goodwill toward men.

01:59:45.668 --> 01:59:49.505
We are the United States Government.
We don't do that sort of thing.

01:59:49.756 --> 01:59:52.675
You're just gonna have to try.

01:59:52.925 --> 01:59:56.304
All right, I'll see what I can do.

01:59:56.554 --> 01:59:58.973
Thank you very much.

01:59:59.223 --> 02:00:02.310
That's all I ask.

02:00:03.269 --> 02:00:05.396
How about you? What do you want?

02:00:05.647 --> 02:00:09.025
I'm fine.

02:00:11.486 --> 02:00:14.864
May I have the box?

02:00:24.165 --> 02:00:27.835
You know it doesn't work. It never did.

02:00:28.086 --> 02:00:29.629
That's not important, is it?

02:00:29.879 --> 02:00:33.675
What's really important is that
none of this ever happened.

02:00:33.925 --> 02:00:37.804
This box doesn't exist.

02:00:38.429 --> 02:00:40.139
I never saw it before.

02:00:40.390 --> 02:00:43.267
Remember that.

02:00:52.151 --> 02:00:54.404
Bishop?

02:00:54.654 --> 02:00:58.366
All you did was say it was broken.

02:00:58.616 --> 02:01:04.205
Can't they still just hook it up
and do terrible things with it?

02:01:05.707 --> 02:01:07.375
Nope.

02:01:07.625 --> 02:01:10.670
<i>In a surprise announcement,
the Republican National Committee...</i>

02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:12.755
<i>has revealed it is bankrupt.</i>

02:01:13.006 --> 02:01:17.010
<i>A spokesman said they had plenty
of money in their accounts last week...</i>

02:01:17.260 --> 02:01:20.304
<i>but today they just don't know
where the money has gone.</i>

02:01:20.555 --> 02:01:22.140
<i>But not everybody's going begging.</i>

02:01:22.390 --> 02:01:26.060
<i>Amnesty International, Greenpeace
and the United Negro College Fund...</i>

02:01:26.311 --> 02:01:28.271
<i>announced record earnings this week...</i>

02:01:28.521 --> 02:01:33.109
