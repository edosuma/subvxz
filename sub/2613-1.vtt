00:47.416 --> 00:48.958
(Dogs yelp)

00:49.085 --> 00:51.124
Hey!

00:51.253 --> 00:53.709
How'd you guys get out?

00:57.051 --> 00:59.043
(Barking)

01:07.853 --> 01:09.846
(Dogs bark and whine)

01:15.569 --> 01:17.562
What's the matter, boys?

01:19.281 --> 01:20.989
Whoa, take it easy!

01:21.117 --> 01:23.109
Hey!

01:41.721 --> 01:43.215
- Thanks.
- Sure.

01:44.557 --> 01:46.300
Uh-uh.

01:48.227 --> 01:49.970
Have you been inside?

01:51.856 --> 01:53.480
What have you got?

02:03.409 --> 02:04.689
There you go, Detective.

02:04.827 --> 02:06.321
Thanks.

02:06.454 --> 02:09.288
Little tired this morning. Pulling a double.

02:09.414 --> 02:10.446
Yeah. Join the club.

02:12.293 --> 02:14.369
Good morning, Catherine.

02:14.503 --> 02:16.994
Good morning, Gil.

02:18.174 --> 02:20.712
So this is Tony Braun's house.

02:20.843 --> 02:22.836
Son of Sam Braun

02:22.970 --> 02:26.054
He was Steve Wynn before Steve Wynn

02:26.182 --> 02:30.049
You bet your ass.
Sam came to Vegas when Vegas was dying.

02:30.186 --> 02:33.103
Built three casinos in a year.

02:33.230 --> 02:35.223
Had ties to Bugsy Siegel.

02:39.320 --> 02:41.645
Wish I had Tony Braun's gardener
working for me.

02:41.781 --> 02:44.022
Guy sniffed it out from the jump.

02:44.158 --> 02:47.029
Blinds were drawn shut, side gate unlooked,

02:47.161 --> 02:48.192
dogs let out

02:48.329 --> 02:50.156
A plus B plus C

02:50.289 --> 02:52.329
equals 911 .

03:03.177 --> 03:05.715
All seems very neat and peaceful, doesn't it?

03:11.268 --> 03:13.475
Chasing the dragon.

03:13.604 --> 03:16.391
Pinch of H, heat the foil, inhale the fumes.

03:20.736 --> 03:22.728
With a Xanax back.

03:25.032 --> 03:27.274
100 pills,

03:27.410 --> 03:30.245
prescription filled yesterday.

03:30.370 --> 03:32.529
So the rumours about old Tony boy are true?

03:32.666 --> 03:34.207
Drug overdose?

03:34.333 --> 03:36.326
It sure seems that way.

03:37.878 --> 03:40.915
If only life were that simple.

04:23.549 --> 04:26.005
Eight rolls two copies.
Case is hot Put a rush on it.

04:26.135 --> 04:27.510
OK.

04:41.734 --> 04:43.193
Lose an earring?

04:45.237 --> 04:46.613
Looks like somebody did.

04:52.828 --> 04:55.948
He's got adhesive residue on his wrists.

04:56.082 --> 04:58.655
He was restrained. Some sort of tape.

04:58.793 --> 05:00.951
- That would be the obvious.
- He had company.

05:01.087 --> 05:02.795
Welcome?

05:02.922 --> 05:04.582
Or unwelcome?

05:04.715 --> 05:08.131
Where's the purge?
Car blows its engine, there's an oil leak.

05:08.260 --> 05:11.795
Guy OD's, where's the body fluid?
Urine, vomit, excrement?

05:11.931 --> 05:13.342
Did somebody clean him up?

05:18.145 --> 05:21.146
Interesting lovebites on chest.

05:21.273 --> 05:23.978
Curious, isn't it?

05:25.986 --> 05:27.529
And he's posed.

05:30.365 --> 05:32.240
When did you know
this was a homicide?

05:32.367 --> 05:33.827
- Initially?
- Yeah.

05:33.953 --> 05:35.447
When I saw the TV on.

05:39.542 --> 05:40.573
(Dog barks)

05:43.838 --> 05:47.705
I'll tell you one thing. lf those were my dogs,
l wouldn't be leaving this gate open.

05:47.842 --> 05:51.258
Yeah, a dog owner on heroin.
How responsible can he be?

05:51.387 --> 05:55.550
The gardener said it's the first time in five years
that he found this gate unlocked.

05:56.726 --> 05:59.014
What's so different about this morning?

05:59.145 --> 06:01.849
The last morning of Tony Braun's life?

06:01.981 --> 06:05.397
Either somebody in the house opened it,
or somebody had a key,

06:05.526 --> 06:07.519
because this lock hasn't been forced.

06:07.653 --> 06:10.322
There's no pry marks, no metal shavings.

06:10.448 --> 06:12.855
So, why was the gate open?

06:14.701 --> 06:17.027
A heroin addict's confetti.

06:17.163 --> 06:19.155
Nothing like going on a binge.

06:29.425 --> 06:31.418
This is black tar heroin.

06:32.553 --> 06:35.222
It's the difference
between a Cadillac and a Pinto.

06:35.347 --> 06:37.755
- How would you know?
- It's my job.

06:38.934 --> 06:41.935
I count at least six balloons,
and that's just in the bedroom.

06:42.063 --> 06:44.185
The dealer must have come down the chimney.

06:44.315 --> 06:46.307
It's like Christmas in July here.

06:49.779 --> 06:52.103
Not that Braun even needed any more drugs.

06:52.239 --> 06:54.565
Looks like the guy had a pill for everything.

06:54.700 --> 06:56.527
Can you get a print off those balloons?

06:57.661 --> 06:59.452
I can get a print off air.

07:04.168 --> 07:05.366
Any luck?

07:05.503 --> 07:07.791
I've gone through every garbage can
in the house.

07:07.922 --> 07:10.757
- What about the cans outside?
- First thing I checked. Zip.

07:44.250 --> 07:45.246
(Barking)

08:15.990 --> 08:17.532
Hey, doc.

08:19.034 --> 08:21.027
Leg fell asleep.

08:23.497 --> 08:26.830
I always wondered which one of us coroners
would get to carve Tony.

08:30.463 --> 08:32.336
His lifestyle was no secret.

08:32.465 --> 08:34.457
Sex, drugs and a big bankroll.

08:35.592 --> 08:37.835
No needle marks on his arms.

08:37.970 --> 08:40.924
The guy plays golf. Short-sleeved shirts.

08:41.057 --> 08:43.630
Check between the toes, groin area.

08:43.768 --> 08:45.392
Whatever he did went up his nose.

08:48.021 --> 08:49.730
Nasal cavity looks like raw hamburger.

08:53.819 --> 08:57.734
These abrasions around his mouth? What?

08:57.865 --> 08:59.359
Hard to shave when you're stoned?

08:59.492 --> 09:01.484
Or they're pressure marks.

09:01.619 --> 09:04.157
For example, if someone
places a pillow or an object

09:04.288 --> 09:07.041
against someone's nose and mouth
in a struggle.

09:09.085 --> 09:10.876
Petechial haemorrhaging

09:11.003 --> 09:12.960
also suggestive of suffocation.

09:13.089 --> 09:15.377
Not always.

09:15.508 --> 09:18.877
For as much as pathology's
an absolute science, it isn't.

09:19.011 --> 09:23.922
Vessels can rupture under innocent
circumstances, such as a violent cough.

09:24.058 --> 09:27.925
These three circular red marks on his chest.

09:28.062 --> 09:29.224
They're not bug bites.

09:29.354 --> 09:31.846
No neurotoxins present.

09:32.983 --> 09:34.359
But that's not to say

09:34.485 --> 09:38.898
some overanxious paramedic trying to save
a legend's life didn't cause them in the moment.

09:39.031 --> 09:40.229
CPR wasn't performed.

09:40.365 --> 09:41.646
Then I don't know what they are.

09:41.784 --> 09:44.619
It's hard to OD just inhaling heroin.

09:44.745 --> 09:46.322
I know he was restrained,

09:46.455 --> 09:52.825
which leads me to believe someone forced him
to ingest lethal amounts of heroin and Xanax.

09:55.172 --> 09:57.331
Excuse me!

09:57.466 --> 09:59.092
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

09:59.218 --> 10:01.924
Boy, are you lucky my lawyer's on a golf course.

10:02.054 --> 10:03.762
I've been standing out Here

10:03.889 --> 10:08.183
in the heat, for hours, answering these
stupid questions. Here's your answer, OK?

10:08.310 --> 10:10.350
This is my house. OK?

10:10.479 --> 10:13.314
This is half my house, anyway.

10:13.441 --> 10:15.267
Who's this?

10:15.401 --> 10:18.437
Braun's squeeze She's an ex-stripper
- Hey! Hey!

10:18.571 --> 10:21.774
- Perhaps you met in a professional capacity.
These are my things!

10:21.907 --> 10:24.778
And uh...where has she been
the past 12 hours?

10:24.910 --> 10:26.321
Well let's see.

10:26.454 --> 10:30.451
On my God!
- Quote: "Out." End quote.

10:30.583 --> 10:33.916
When Tony's drug dealer showed up
she split She slept at a friend's

10:34.045 --> 10:38.291
She didn't like the way Tony acted
when he was cruising on magic carpets.

10:38.424 --> 10:39.669
Listen.

10:39.800 --> 10:43.383
If anything is missing from here,
I'm gonna add you to my lawyer's To Sue list.

10:43.512 --> 10:45.220
Why don't you just put the camera away

10:45.347 --> 10:46.510
before you get arrested?

10:46.640 --> 10:49.214
You can't arrest me in my own house.

10:49.351 --> 10:51.889
Right now, your house is our crime scene.

10:52.020 --> 10:53.349
Uh...

10:53.481 --> 10:55.473
We can do whatever we want.

10:55.608 --> 10:57.980
That includes fingerprinting you.

10:58.110 --> 11:00.815
Why? Didn't do anything.

11:00.946 --> 11:03.651
- Thumb to pinkie.
- Oh, look...

11:03.783 --> 11:08.777
I just lost my boyfriend, OK? You're a woman.
I'm just looking out for my end here.

11:08.913 --> 11:10.656
You know?

11:11.624 --> 11:13.663
Things start to disappear...

11:13.793 --> 11:18.040
If Tony were here, he'd tell you himself.
"Just make sure Janine's taken care of."

11:18.172 --> 11:19.583
That's a lawyer's call.

11:19.715 --> 11:21.091
Hey, I'm in the will.

11:22.259 --> 11:23.754
Of course you are.

11:31.351 --> 11:32.514
Can I help you?

11:32.645 --> 11:35.562
- Is Sam Braun in?
- He's not seeing anyone today.

11:35.689 --> 11:39.770
Would you let him know
that Catherine Willows is here to see him?

11:45.449 --> 11:48.023
Just one second, please.

11:59.714 --> 12:00.912
Mugs?

12:12.768 --> 12:15.057
I remember the first time I saw you.

12:15.187 --> 12:17.394
You didn't have any clothes on.

12:17.523 --> 12:19.516
Yeah, well, that was a long time ago.

12:19.650 --> 12:22.686
I would have taken you home right then
if I could have.

12:24.196 --> 12:26.652
I know, but you were married,
and I was a baby.

12:27.783 --> 12:29.776
It would have never worked.

12:30.911 --> 12:33.485
Hey, Sam, how are you holding up?

12:33.622 --> 12:34.618
Hey, Dad!

12:34.749 --> 12:38.497
I got the press clogging up valet.
Should I call security, just handle it, or what?

12:38.627 --> 12:39.659
I'll take care of it.

12:39.795 --> 12:43.164
You go back to the pit.
Make sure nobody's robbing us blind.

12:45.926 --> 12:47.800
You know,

12:47.928 --> 12:51.132
back in...uh...in '67,

12:52.266 --> 12:54.757
I was in my 20s,

12:54.894 --> 12:57.598
and I was drinking in a dive in downtown Buffalo.

12:58.731 --> 13:03.274
At the end of the bar was this pro quarterback,
drinking double Scotches two at a time,

13:03.402 --> 13:05.359
midnight to seven in the morning.

13:05.488 --> 13:07.314
It's Sunday. Game day, mind you.

13:08.449 --> 13:09.777
So you know what I did?

13:09.909 --> 13:11.866
Called my bookie, bet against him.

13:13.204 --> 13:14.484
Guess what.

13:16.957 --> 13:20.042
I'll be damned if he didn't throw
six touchdown passes.

13:20.169 --> 13:23.205
Yeah. Sounds like Tony.

13:24.965 --> 13:28.714
You know, even when Tony was juicing,

13:28.844 --> 13:32.463
he could run circles
round these college Harvard types.

13:35.142 --> 13:38.558
And I'm not saying that just cos he was my kid.

13:38.687 --> 13:42.934
Tony was the best damn casino exec
this town has ever seen.

13:44.985 --> 13:46.978
Just between you and me,

13:48.823 --> 13:50.780
I couldn't hold a candle to him.

13:53.160 --> 13:55.153
And now he's dead.

13:56.956 --> 13:58.664
Overdose.

13:58.791 --> 14:00.784
Sam,

14:02.795 --> 14:04.503
the bigger the pedestal,

14:05.715 --> 14:08.170
the bigger the target.

14:12.555 --> 14:17.715
Nobody shoots at that target
without going through me.

14:17.852 --> 14:19.761
Well, that's business.

14:20.896 --> 14:22.688
What about personal?

14:26.110 --> 14:27.438
What do you mean?

14:27.570 --> 14:31.104
Did you ever talk to Tony
about any of his girlfriends?

14:31.240 --> 14:34.443
Which one? They were all
trying to pick the gold out of his teeth.

14:34.577 --> 14:36.569
Janine Haywood.

14:36.703 --> 14:38.531
She's the worst.

14:39.665 --> 14:41.872
And he loved her the most. Can you believe it?

14:42.002 --> 14:43.875
Yeah. I do.

14:48.924 --> 14:53.218
If I know her type, now that she has the gold,

14:53.345 --> 14:56.431
she'll be going after the silver.

15:10.237 --> 15:13.404
(Fizzing)

16:04.834 --> 16:08.368
OK. On the left,
Braun prints we got from the coroner.

16:08.504 --> 16:10.295
And on the right,

16:10.423 --> 16:12.499
gold-digger prints I got from Janine Haywood.

16:12.633 --> 16:15.836
Here's where it gets interesting.
I took six prints off this bottle.

16:15.970 --> 16:17.512
- And?
- They belong to one person.

16:17.638 --> 16:20.722
Good thing or...bad thing?

16:20.850 --> 16:22.130
It's good if you're us,

16:23.894 --> 16:25.887
bad if you're Janine Haywood.

16:27.064 --> 16:29.187
Hm.

16:32.153 --> 16:35.189
- Have you seen Brass?
- Not tonight, no. Why?

16:35.322 --> 16:41.740
Oh...print off air. Orange balloon, cyanoacrylate.
Dead bang. Drug dealer.

16:42.872 --> 16:44.663
Ooh! Ooh! Watch it! Evidence.

16:44.790 --> 16:46.450
- Where'd you get it?
- Cracker box.

16:46.584 --> 16:49.917
It was all stuck together.
I don't want to ruin any potential prints,

16:50.046 --> 16:53.212
but I saw this TV dinner commercial,
and it hit me.

16:53.340 --> 16:55.333
I'm gonna put it in the freezer.

16:57.636 --> 17:01.136
- Did you try this coffee?
- Mm-mm.

17:01.265 --> 17:03.008
The last cup I had tasted like motor oil.

17:03.142 --> 17:04.969
Oh, don't touch it! That's my pot!

17:06.479 --> 17:07.559
Your pot?

17:07.688 --> 17:09.977
Yeah, you know, for my own private stash.

17:10.107 --> 17:11.648
Blue Hawaiian.

17:11.776 --> 17:14.444
$40 a pound, only grown
a couple of times a year on the Big Island,

17:14.569 --> 17:16.361
hand-picked to perfection.

17:16.489 --> 17:20.022
Good. You're using my water,
so I guess that makes it community coffee.

17:20.159 --> 17:21.321
You want a cup, Nick?

17:21.452 --> 17:22.863
No. Thanks.

17:22.994 --> 17:25.829
- What's the matter with your leg?
- I don't know, man.

17:25.955 --> 17:28.244
Something back at that house
must have bitten me.

17:28.376 --> 17:31.412
Oh, is that alcohol on a bug bite?

17:31.545 --> 17:34.665
Like butter on burns, man. Wives' tale.

17:34.799 --> 17:37.372
This guy told me
to put haemorrhoid cream on my acne.

17:37.510 --> 17:39.883
It worked, didn't it?

17:43.182 --> 17:45.175
This is pretty good.

17:46.227 --> 17:48.634
Let me see the bite before you get gangrene.

17:49.855 --> 17:51.397
- Chigger bite.
- Yeah?

17:51.524 --> 17:54.394
Probably picked it up
in the ferns in Braun's back yard.

17:54.527 --> 17:58.394
See if Catherine's got clear nail polish.
It'll seal it off, keep it from itching.

18:00.199 --> 18:03.698
- What happened with that doggy door?
- Something two-legged went through it.

18:03.828 --> 18:06.532
We got mostly partials.
The Print Lab's working on it.

18:06.665 --> 18:09.369
Be sure to check it
against Janine Haywood's prints.

18:10.835 --> 18:13.871
Braun's stomach contents.

18:14.004 --> 18:15.914
No food, plenty of drugs.

18:16.048 --> 18:17.627
- Xanax?
- And heroin.

18:17.758 --> 18:19.585
I thought he inhaled it.

18:19.719 --> 18:21.592
- Inhaled and ingested.
- He ate it?

18:21.721 --> 18:22.669
Got there somehow.

18:23.848 --> 18:27.051
- Where are all the undissolved pills?
- Didn't find any.

18:28.227 --> 18:30.765
Most ODs die before digestion's complete, right?

18:30.896 --> 18:35.891
It's my guess someone mashed up the Xanax,
dissolved them in red wine, which I did find.

18:36.026 --> 18:39.561
OK. So what do we know
that we can write home about?

18:39.696 --> 18:43.232
Well, Braun was a heroin addict,
using heavy just before he died,

18:43.367 --> 18:46.119
which means he was probably meek as a lamb.

18:46.245 --> 18:49.163
It wouldn't have taken much
to bind his hands with duct tape.

18:49.290 --> 18:51.117
And make him drink hemlock.

18:51.250 --> 18:53.159
It's a lot easier

18:53.294 --> 18:56.330
to pour liquid down a guy's throat
than it is to make him swallow 100 pills.

18:56.464 --> 18:58.124
It wasn't 100 pills.

18:58.257 --> 19:00.629
- How many?
- Educated, unofficial guess,

19:00.760 --> 19:03.132
no more than 50.

19:07.933 --> 19:09.926
Based on your pupes,
I could take you in now.

19:10.061 --> 19:13.097
Hey, man, I'm in mourning. It's tears you see.

19:13.230 --> 19:16.480
I lost a customer. It's like losing my job, kind of.

19:16.609 --> 19:19.645
- You're Braun's grocery store?
- But I deliver.

19:19.779 --> 19:22.614
- So when did you last deliver?
- The night before he croaked.

19:22.740 --> 19:27.034
About nine o'clock. Ask his woman.
She fine, too.

19:27.161 --> 19:29.319
She told us, soon as you got there, she left.

19:29.455 --> 19:31.448
Oh, she didn't go that fast.

19:31.582 --> 19:34.998
I dropped off some balloons,
Braun paid me, she gave me a tip.

19:35.127 --> 19:36.835
What, "Shave the soul patch"?

19:36.962 --> 19:40.213
Ha! No.

19:40.342 --> 19:42.879
- 30 Xanadus.
- Xanax?

19:43.010 --> 19:45.335
I told you, I dropped them
down the bathroom sink.

19:45.471 --> 19:47.713
First time I heard that.

19:47.848 --> 19:51.549
Look, I took two, gave Tony two,

19:51.685 --> 19:54.889
and I accidentally dropped 15 or 20
down the sink.

19:55.022 --> 19:56.730
It was an accident. You know?

19:56.857 --> 19:58.055
An accident?

19:58.192 --> 20:00.398
Haven't you ever spilt a drink?

20:00.528 --> 20:04.027
Not lately.
We found 50 Xanax in Tony's stomach.

20:04.156 --> 20:05.650
Don't pin that on me. I left.

20:05.783 --> 20:08.819
I'll tell you what you left.
Your prints all over the bottle.

20:08.953 --> 20:11.325
I went to the pharmacy! Waited in line,

20:11.455 --> 20:13.993
picked up the prescription, signed for it,

20:14.125 --> 20:15.749
brought it back to the house.

20:15.876 --> 20:20.206
You know Tony did nothing for himself
except work and get high.

20:20.339 --> 20:22.711
- It got you a new Mercedes, didn't it?
- Yes, it did.

20:24.051 --> 20:26.922
It'll buy me the dress for Tony's funeral too.

20:27.054 --> 20:29.724
When you left your half a house,
where did you go?

20:29.807 --> 20:31.883
- A friend's.
- Well, let's get her on the line.

20:32.017 --> 20:33.560
She's out of town.

20:33.685 --> 20:36.058
Let me guess. She's incommunicado?

20:36.188 --> 20:39.392
If that means you can't reach her, yeah.

20:41.652 --> 20:43.645
Oh! Mind the dummy.

20:45.406 --> 20:48.360
It's been 24 minutes, Greg.
When's this thing gonna be done?

20:48.492 --> 20:52.572
Well, with all due respect, sir,
it's not a baked potato. It's Braun's blood.

20:52.704 --> 20:56.750
And with all the impurities in his system,
it might take a little extra time.

20:56.876 --> 20:59.247
Did I ever tell you I used to live in New York?

20:59.378 --> 21:01.786
Is this gonna be a short story or a novel?

21:01.922 --> 21:05.089
(Beeping)
- Excuse me.

21:05.217 --> 21:09.678
You know, heroin has a nine-minute half-life.
After that it metabolises into morphine.

21:09.805 --> 21:11.086
What's the 6-MAM count?

21:11.223 --> 21:12.931
158 nanograms per mil.

21:13.059 --> 21:14.968
Definitely not lethal.

21:15.102 --> 21:18.471
The same with Xanax.
Quarter-mil tabs, 100 micrograms per litre.

21:18.606 --> 21:22.935
Again, not lethal. There's addicts walking around
Times Square with more drugs in their system.

21:24.111 --> 21:26.400
So Braun should still be walking around.

21:30.076 --> 21:33.076
And the er...point of your New York story was...?

21:33.204 --> 21:36.454
Oh, I was just gonna tell you
about another way to take heroin.

21:36.582 --> 21:40.283
A suppository up the coolee.
You just stand on your head and let gravity...

21:41.921 --> 21:43.629
Forget it.

21:51.180 --> 21:54.763
Braun didn't die of a drug overdose,
accidental or otherwise.

21:54.892 --> 21:57.134
I figured. So why did I bring the dummy?

22:00.064 --> 22:01.973
Braun's shirt.

22:02.108 --> 22:05.144
Robbins opened him up.
His lungs were compressed.

22:05.277 --> 22:08.896
Remember Burke and Hare,
the 19th-century Scottish body snatchers?

22:09.031 --> 22:12.115
Made a living intoxicating innocent victims
and suffocating them,

22:12.243 --> 22:13.986
sold the cadavers to teaching hospitals?

22:14.120 --> 22:17.952
Got away with it, too,
till a student discovered his fiancée on a slab.

22:18.082 --> 22:20.834
Is this part of the Sherlock Holmes Fan Club kit?

22:22.420 --> 22:24.163
Janine Haywood...

22:24.296 --> 22:28.045
said that she left the house
when the drug dealer arrived.

22:28.175 --> 22:29.338
I think she came back.

22:29.468 --> 22:32.718
So Braun would have been
on his third or fourth balloon by then?

22:34.932 --> 22:39.060
It would have been easy to tape his wrists,
mash up 50 pills...

22:42.689 --> 22:44.813
..force-feed him a Xanax cocktail.

22:44.942 --> 22:47.611
Everything was going great
till the gardener showed up.

22:47.694 --> 22:50.815
And then I think her plan turned to panic.

22:50.948 --> 22:54.530
It takes time to OD.
Time Janine didn't have.

22:58.164 --> 23:00.489
Burke would kneel on his victim's chest,

23:00.624 --> 23:02.582
covering his mouth and nostrils.

23:02.710 --> 23:06.328
When you're doing drugs, you're a slob.

23:06.464 --> 23:08.705
When you're being manhandled,
you're even sloppier.

23:11.177 --> 23:12.505
Like this.

23:20.394 --> 23:21.853
He was Burked.

23:21.979 --> 23:23.354
(Phone rings)

23:26.734 --> 23:27.896
Hello?

23:28.026 --> 23:31.692
just outside Blue Diamond
- Where?

23:31.822 --> 23:33.861
Brass? You're breaking up

23:36.660 --> 23:39.578
Said he was in Blue Diamond,
digging something up.

23:42.708 --> 23:44.452
(Sirens)

23:49.048 --> 23:50.672
<i>NEW ORDER: Crystal</i>

23:50.800 --> 23:52.377
<i>We're like crystal</i>

23:52.510 --> 23:55.427
<i>Yeah</i>

23:55.554 --> 23:56.883
<i>We break easy</i>

23:57.014 --> 23:58.556
<i>Ooh-ooh</i>

23:58.682 --> 24:01.434
<i>I'm a poor man</i>

24:01.560 --> 24:03.103
<i>If you leave me</i>

24:03.229 --> 24:04.391
<i>Ooh-ooh...</i>

24:06.273 --> 24:08.562
Hey! Hey, what's going on?

24:08.692 --> 24:11.361
Anybody ever tell you to call before you dig?

24:11.445 --> 24:12.774
I got permission to be here.

24:12.905 --> 24:14.814
Oh, is that right?

24:14.949 --> 24:17.654
From who? A dead man?

24:17.785 --> 24:19.576
You got a name?

24:19.703 --> 24:21.945
My name's Curt Ritten. Look, Tony Braun?

24:22.081 --> 24:23.908
He was a friend of mine right?

24:24.041 --> 24:25.322
This is his property.

24:25.459 --> 24:29.327
He calls me a month ago, he says,
!If anything should happen to me, start digging,

24:29.463 --> 24:32.001
take care of what's mine at all cost."

24:32.133 --> 24:34.588
- That's what I'm doing.
- Do me a favour, Curt Ritten.

24:34.719 --> 24:38.467
Put down the shovel.
OK.

24:38.597 --> 24:40.590
- Stand over there.
- OK.

24:40.725 --> 24:43.097
Maybe Janine had a helper.

24:48.065 --> 24:51.600
Hey, guys?
You might want to check out the basement.

25:43.829 --> 25:47.697
A sable cloud turns forth its silver lining
to the night.

25:49.293 --> 25:51.286
That's a lot of motive.

25:54.090 --> 25:56.082
And a lot of silver.

26:33.212 --> 26:36.795
OK. Three rolls of tape,
found in a truck owned by Curt Ritten.

26:36.924 --> 26:38.205
Nice!

26:38.342 --> 26:40.880
Let's see if that's where my print came from.

26:42.012 --> 26:43.720
No match.
Aw!

26:43.848 --> 26:48.426
Listen to you! Would you rather hit a home run
in the fourth or the bottom of the ninth?

26:49.562 --> 26:52.053
Let me ask you something.
Braun collected silver.

26:52.189 --> 26:53.648
Coins bullion...

26:53.774 --> 26:55.150
23 tons of it.

26:55.276 --> 26:57.268
Why bury it in Blue Diamond?

26:57.403 --> 27:02.479
Cos he was smart. For the past 20 years,
the value of silver's gone to nothing.

27:02.616 --> 27:07.824
A commodity broker's gonna charge you
a storage fee per troy ounce.

27:07.955 --> 27:12.498
There's only one thing worse
than losing T-8% on silver a year.

27:12.626 --> 27:15.544
That's losing 9-10%
because of some stupid storage fee.

27:15.671 --> 27:18.625
What good's collecting silver coupons
when you're dead?

27:18.758 --> 27:20.300
Depends on who's doing the clipping.

27:22.053 --> 27:26.346
Oh, we got a positive association! Roll to tape.

27:26.474 --> 27:28.098
Curt to Tony.

27:29.518 --> 27:31.926
- Are you arresting me for digging?
- No.

27:32.063 --> 27:34.102
Burglary, theft and conspiracy, to start.

27:34.231 --> 27:39.771
Tony asked me to move his silver collection to
his ranch in Wyoming. I'm doing what I was told.

27:39.904 --> 27:41.647
Mr Ritten? It appears

27:41.781 --> 27:45.232
we may have physical evidence
connecting you to the murder of Tony Braun.

27:45.367 --> 27:47.775
Look, I had nothing to do with the drugs.

27:47.912 --> 27:51.411
I swear to you, I haven't messed around
with that stuff in a long time.

27:51.540 --> 27:55.787
I was always telling Tony, as a friend,
to get off of it. To walk away.

27:55.920 --> 28:00.416
- How'd you know where the silver was buried?
- I built the vault for him! I'm a contractor.

28:00.549 --> 28:02.838
- That's what I do.
- Ever work at his house?

28:02.968 --> 28:09.137
No. We did talk about me building a basement
for him once. It never got off the ground.

28:09.266 --> 28:11.639
- So you've been to his house?
- We were friends.

28:11.769 --> 28:13.477
I've been to his house plenty of times.

28:13.604 --> 28:16.558
I was there a couple of weeks ago.
We watched the Notre Dame game.

28:16.690 --> 28:20.439
Did you ever leave anything there
or bring anything over to his house?

28:20.569 --> 28:23.855
Yeah, I brought a six-pack and some chips.

28:23.989 --> 28:26.148
Sour cream.

28:26.283 --> 28:31.159
Tools of the trade, Curt.
Construction items. Hammer.

28:31.288 --> 28:32.533
- Duct tape
- No.

28:32.666 --> 28:35.998
Why would I do that?
I got no idea what you're talking about.

28:36.127 --> 28:38.166
Whatever you don't tell us, we'll find it.

28:47.888 --> 28:49.964
It's the quickest warrant I ever got.

28:50.099 --> 28:53.135
Yeah. The Braun family. Long arms.

28:56.647 --> 29:00.597
I thought you said that Ritten's wife
lives in Carson City?

29:00.735 --> 29:04.186
She does. They both do.
He just stays here when he's working.

29:05.489 --> 29:07.482
Or digging up silver.

29:10.411 --> 29:12.403
(Door opens)

29:22.882 --> 29:24.340
Mrs Ritten?

29:26.218 --> 29:28.211
Criminalistics.

29:31.724 --> 29:33.099
Police officer.

29:37.855 --> 29:39.100
Oh!

29:39.231 --> 29:40.726
Jeez!

29:40.858 --> 29:42.436
You scared me!

29:42.568 --> 29:43.683
How'd you get in here?

29:43.819 --> 29:45.563
I don't have to ask you that question.

29:47.073 --> 29:49.777
How can this be, Mandy?
We found the tape in the guy's truck.

29:49.909 --> 29:52.779
You're telling us the prints on that tape
aren't his or hers?

29:52.912 --> 29:56.115
If their names are Curt Ritten
and Janine Haywood, the answer's no.

29:56.248 --> 29:58.918
- This is ridiculous.
- This thing must have a virus.

29:59.001 --> 30:02.619
- Maybe you have the wrong suspects.
- That's easy for you to say.

30:02.755 --> 30:04.629
All you do is scan prints all day and hit Enter.

30:04.757 --> 30:06.299
Look, I'm not your beast of burden.

30:06.425 --> 30:08.465
Sara, this is your thing.

30:08.594 --> 30:11.797
Mandy? Give me something dandy.

30:11.931 --> 30:13.473
I'll give you something dandy.

30:13.599 --> 30:16.766
Your doggy door prints.
Goodbye. I have to go on a break now.

30:22.400 --> 30:24.973
- See what I mean?
- Your prints came back unknown too?

30:25.111 --> 30:28.314
No. Came back Walt Braun.

30:28.447 --> 30:31.781
- Who is he?
- He's Tony Braun's brother.

30:31.909 --> 30:37.069
He's a pit boss at the Tangiers,
which is why his prints are on file. Gaming card.

30:37.206 --> 30:40.492
He's family. Why's he using the doggy door,
not the front door?

30:40.626 --> 30:45.038
Huh. Go figure. The more evidence shows up,
the more this case doesn't make sense.

30:45.172 --> 30:49.252
We got two suspects in custody
and neither of their prints are on the duct tape.

30:49.385 --> 30:51.461
Or on the doggy door.

30:51.595 --> 30:53.588
- But the brother's are.
- Mm-hm.

30:53.723 --> 30:55.845
- So call the Print Lab.
- It's been done.

30:55.975 --> 30:58.181
They're not Walt Braun's prints on the tape.

30:58.310 --> 31:00.303
Came back unknown.

31:00.438 --> 31:01.980
Hey.

31:02.106 --> 31:05.142
I've got Detective Vega rounding up Walt Braun.

31:05.276 --> 31:08.442
Apparently this Janine Haywood
really got around.

31:09.822 --> 31:12.574
When she wasn't at Braun's house
playing girlfriend.

31:12.699 --> 31:15.369
she was over at Vault Boy's flat,
playing mistress

31:15.453 --> 31:18.026
Which gives neither of them a credible alibi

31:18.456 --> 31:21.789
Flimsy alibis don't prove murder.
What else have we got?

31:21.917 --> 31:24.622
- Nothing probative.
Let the girlfriend go?

31:24.754 --> 31:28.205
Curt Ritten goes back to lockup till he posts bail.

31:28.340 --> 31:31.377
Forget Curt. Forget Janine.
Forget the suspects. It's simple.

31:31.510 --> 31:33.836
We got to figure out how a piece of duct tape

31:33.971 --> 31:37.672
from a roll in Ritten's truck
ended up wrapped round the wrists of our victim.

31:37.808 --> 31:39.302
Without Curt's prints on it.

31:43.147 --> 31:45.816
- Curt, we're out of here.
- You're gonna take this too?

31:45.941 --> 31:47.649
Hun? I come down here

31:47.777 --> 31:51.525
with a cheque to bail my husband out,
and you say to him, "We're out of here"?

31:51.655 --> 31:53.565
No, honey, you're out of here.

31:53.699 --> 31:55.193
- Bonnie, take it easy
- Easy?

31:55.326 --> 31:57.069
How many men do you need? Huh?

31:57.203 --> 31:58.578
At least I can take care of mine.

31:58.704 --> 32:04.244
I've stuck by you through bankruptcies, flings,
lies, and I've had it, OK? So you choose.

32:04.377 --> 32:06.250
Me or her!

32:06.379 --> 32:08.252
Sorry, Janine.

32:08.381 --> 32:11.216
Yeah. Heard that before.

32:13.010 --> 32:14.718
Call me.

32:15.846 --> 32:17.922
Bail processing is this way.

32:26.148 --> 32:27.772
Been there.

32:27.900 --> 32:32.229
You came down here to ask me about a doggy
door? I could have told you over the phone.

32:32.362 --> 32:35.233
It's a quirk.
I like to discuss fingerprints in person.

32:35.365 --> 32:37.904
- Tony and I went to dinner.
- How long ago?

32:38.035 --> 32:40.111
A while back.

32:40.246 --> 32:43.080
- Be more specific.
- Uh, about a month and a half ago.

32:43.207 --> 32:44.915
We ate at Piero's

32:45.042 --> 32:47.450
Talked a little business. I dropped him off.

32:47.878 --> 32:49.289
Walt!

32:49.422 --> 32:50.584
Come here for a second, will you?

32:51.006 --> 32:52.584
My key still works here.

32:52.717 --> 32:55.967
- How come it doesn't work on the front door?
- I changed the locks.

32:56.345 --> 32:57.839
So I use the doggy door,

32:58.222 --> 33:01.425
walk through the house, open the door...
let Tony in.

33:01.559 --> 33:04.263
A guy with that kind of money
doesn't have a security alarm?

33:04.395 --> 33:06.720
When you're a Braun,
there's nothing you can't replace.

33:06.856 --> 33:09.062
You can't replace your brother.

33:11.235 --> 33:12.813
What's the matter with your leg?

33:12.945 --> 33:14.818
I don't know. Something must have bit me.

33:14.947 --> 33:17.948
- Mind if I take a look?
- What are you, a dermatologist?

33:18.075 --> 33:21.491
I'm an entomologist, actually.
I know all about bugs.

33:21.620 --> 33:24.657
Sure. Can you tell me what to put on it?
It's killing me.

33:25.833 --> 33:27.624
Chigger bites.

33:28.961 --> 33:32.412
You might want to try some nail polish,
keep it from itching.

33:32.548 --> 33:34.790
Would you mind if I took a photograph,

33:34.925 --> 33:37.416
- for my bite collection?
- Whatever rubs your Buddha.

33:44.810 --> 33:46.139
We're almost done.

33:46.270 --> 33:48.310
Mr Braun, where do you live?

33:48.439 --> 33:50.147
Shoshone Hi-Rise. JW Brown Road.

33:50.274 --> 33:52.480
And you work here?
Yean.

33:52.610 --> 33:54.852
I'm a glorified pit boss.

33:54.987 --> 33:58.356
In the last 48 hours, have you been
anywhere else besides those two places?

33:58.491 --> 34:00.649
No. My life's pretty routine.

34:04.288 --> 34:06.281
It might just get a little more routine.

34:12.420 --> 34:14.828
Nick? I need your leg. Show me your bite.

34:14.965 --> 34:17.041
- It's no worries. I got some cream.
- Hey!

34:17.176 --> 34:18.801
All right. It's no big deal, really.

34:30.313 --> 34:32.556
What time did you log in at the Braun house?

34:32.690 --> 34:33.889
9:15 that morning.

34:34.025 --> 34:36.315
How long after that
did you start in the back yard?

34:36.445 --> 34:40.277
- About a half-hour.
- You're not the only one with chigger bites.

34:40.408 --> 34:42.364
Who is this?

34:42.493 --> 34:43.868
Walt Braun.

34:43.994 --> 34:45.737
It's now 9:30 at night.

34:45.871 --> 34:50.034
Approximately 36 hours ago, you were bitten.
Three hours earlier than that,

34:50.167 --> 34:53.252
Tony Braun was murdered.
Chiggers run a predictable course.

34:53.379 --> 34:57.708
A chigger attaches itself to a hair follicle
and injects a digestive enzyme

34:57.842 --> 35:00.926
into the skin,
which ruptures the surrounding cells,

35:01.303 --> 35:04.055
allowing the chigger to suck them up,

35:04.181 --> 35:06.933
leaving behind a red, itchy bump.

35:07.059 --> 35:09.846
- So?
- Walt Braun lied.

35:09.979 --> 35:13.763
We now have an entomological timeline
that places him at the house

35:13.899 --> 35:15.892
on the day his brother was murdered.

35:16.026 --> 35:17.106
Ah, I don't know, boss.

35:17.236 --> 35:18.896
I mean, ask yourself the question.

35:19.029 --> 35:23.941
Are doggy door prints and chigger bites
enough to get a man for murder?

35:34.962 --> 35:36.540
What have we got?

35:36.672 --> 35:40.373
Well, I got motive.
According to the family lawyer, the drug addict...

35:40.509 --> 35:42.716
Now, Jim, that's just a little callous.

35:42.845 --> 35:47.139
Call it what it is. I mean, I know you're friends
with the family, but the guy used heroin.

35:47.266 --> 35:50.220
He was a drug addict
who waited to inherit the old man's fortune.

35:50.352 --> 35:51.266
And the brother?

35:51.395 --> 35:54.065
- Walt's out of the picture. He's out in the cold.
- He is?

35:54.148 --> 35:58.193
Yeah. But Tony promised to take care of him.
Whatever he got, he'd split 50:50.

35:58.319 --> 36:00.774
All in silver included,

36:00.905 --> 36:02.067
until about a month ago.

36:02.198 --> 36:05.152
But Tony changed his mind,
which changed the will.

36:05.284 --> 36:09.234
So wait a second. Janine, the stripper,
claims that half of everything is hers.

36:09.372 --> 36:11.494
That's actually more than wishful thinking?

36:11.624 --> 36:16.286
Bet Walt wasn't too happy about that,
his 50:50 going 75:25 the wrong way.

36:16.420 --> 36:19.207
Curt was digging up the silver
to protect Janine's interest.

36:19.341 --> 36:23.420
- What's in front of us that we're missing?
- What evidence do we have that's still open?

36:23.552 --> 36:26.886
I just got the references off Walt Braun,
gave the samples to Greg.

36:27.014 --> 36:29.885
A couple of things
on the priority list haven't been processed

36:30.017 --> 36:33.018
Tape lifts. Adhesive residue.
I got the earring back.

36:33.145 --> 36:34.521
Where'd you find that?

36:34.647 --> 36:36.521
Living room, near the body.

36:36.649 --> 36:39.104
- We have to deal with that.
- Test it against Janine.

36:39.235 --> 36:40.729
If you want to swab me, go ahead.

36:40.861 --> 36:43.435
But I can save you the Q-tip.
That's really not my style.

36:43.572 --> 36:47.107
- Ms Haywood, you have pierced ears.
- Yeah.

36:47.243 --> 36:49.401
He doesn't understand. I don't wear studs.

36:49.537 --> 36:53.119
Haven't worn studs since like...
God, seventh grade.

36:53.249 --> 36:54.494
Mm-hm.

36:54.625 --> 36:56.618
Can I see that picture?

36:58.879 --> 37:00.255
See?

37:00.381 --> 37:02.753
This is an earring back. It goes to a stud earring.

37:02.883 --> 37:04.959
I don't wear studs. I'm more of a dangle gal.

37:05.094 --> 37:08.130
I like chandeliers. They move with you.
They're on wires, no backs.

37:08.264 --> 37:10.422
Are you finished?

37:10.558 --> 37:12.431
Open your mouth.

37:14.686 --> 37:17.356
Don't bite down. Wouldn't want you to swallow it.

37:17.440 --> 37:18.934
How about your girlfriends?

37:19.066 --> 37:21.355
Or...Tony's girlfriends?

37:21.485 --> 37:23.063
Any of them wear studs?

37:23.195 --> 37:26.030
Look, Rule No. 1,
no women allowed in the house.

37:26.157 --> 37:30.320
Tony had a wandering eye,
he had a wad of cash. Who needed that drama?

37:30.453 --> 37:32.492
- What about the maid?
- Rule No. 2.

37:32.621 --> 37:36.702
Heavy-set, over 50,
no make-up, no jewellery, no English.

37:36.834 --> 37:40.583
- Wow! You got this whole thing down, huh?
- Yeah. This is my house.

37:40.713 --> 37:42.587
I didn't do anything wrong.

37:42.715 --> 37:44.921
I inherited Josie, and she cleans real good.

37:45.051 --> 37:50.175
- How often does she vacuum?
- Every day. Except on her day off.

37:50.306 --> 37:52.383
Hm. The day Tony died.

37:52.516 --> 37:54.509
Mm.

37:54.643 --> 37:57.217
Well, if the maid is
as good as Janine says she is...

37:57.354 --> 37:59.347
Then the earring back was lost that day.

38:01.358 --> 38:03.351
Here. Well, maybe not.

38:03.486 --> 38:07.270
The earring back - not Janine's.
But it was in the ear of a female.

38:07.406 --> 38:11.274
So I guess Rule No. 1 was broken.
There was a woman in the house.

38:11.410 --> 38:13.284
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

38:13.412 --> 38:16.413
Whoever's prints are on the duct tape
is missing an earring back.

38:16.540 --> 38:19.577
- Who's the only other woman in the story?
- She lives in Carson City.

38:19.710 --> 38:22.913
- She's here now.
- And she has access to Curt's truck.

38:23.047 --> 38:25.502
- The fight in the police department?
- Hell hath no fury.

38:27.510 --> 38:29.668
It's not mine. I don't wear earrings.

38:29.804 --> 38:33.552
You know, it's funny.
Just recently I had a little education in earrings.

38:33.682 --> 38:35.059
And I noticed

38:35.184 --> 38:37.058
- that you have pierced ears.
- So what?

38:37.186 --> 38:40.637
If you don't wear earrings for a while,
the holes will close up.

38:40.773 --> 38:43.346
Will you volunteer a DNA sample?

38:43.484 --> 38:46.319
It will confirm your story, or confirm ours.

38:46.445 --> 38:48.105
I'm not giving you anything.

38:48.239 --> 38:50.527
It's OK, Jim. We have enough.

38:50.658 --> 38:53.148
You should have let your husband rot in jail.

38:53.285 --> 38:55.776
We lifted your thumbprint

38:55.913 --> 38:58.202
from the cheque that you posted for his bail.

38:58.332 --> 39:02.661
We compared it to a set of unknown prints
we found on some duct tape at the crime scene.

39:02.795 --> 39:05.500
Just like a pair of earrings
identical

39:05.631 --> 39:08.384
So you were at Tony's house
the morning he died.

39:10.136 --> 39:11.844
Along with Walt Braun,

39:11.971 --> 39:14.296
whose prints we found on the doggy door.

39:33.576 --> 39:36.493
You know, sometimes, doing the job that we do,

39:36.620 --> 39:40.950
our biggest break
comes from the most innocent circumstance.

39:41.083 --> 39:43.075
It was the maid's day off.

39:43.210 --> 39:44.753
But not the gardener's.

39:44.879 --> 39:48.923
That's the thing about murder.
You never think to have a backup plan.

39:49.050 --> 39:51.754
The dogs led the gardener right to you.

39:53.554 --> 39:56.223
So you had to wing it,

39:56.640 --> 39:57.839
and finish him off.

39:58.934 --> 40:01.852
The gardener came to the window.

40:03.856 --> 40:05.979
But he didn't see you.

40:06.358 --> 40:08.731
So you removed the tape from Tony's wrists

40:08.861 --> 40:11.352
and made it look like an OD.

40:11.489 --> 40:13.446
What I don't get is,

40:13.574 --> 40:17.572
you and Walt Braun
didn't move in the same circles.

40:17.703 --> 40:19.696
How'd the two of you hook up?

40:22.958 --> 40:24.951
Newsflash, sweetheart.

40:26.212 --> 40:28.963
You can't make a deal
if you keep your mouth shut.

40:34.428 --> 40:36.302
That's the thing about my father.

40:37.431 --> 40:40.218
He could never give advice,

40:40.352 --> 40:43.221
but he had a million stories.

40:43.353 --> 40:46.189
"The Scorpion and the Frog."

40:48.067 --> 40:52.444
The Scorpion needed to get across the creek
and asked the frog for a ride.

40:53.739 --> 40:57.523
The frog says,
"I can't trust you, you're a scorpion."

40:57.660 --> 41:00.826
The scorpion says, "Sure you can,"

41:00.955 --> 41:04.075
and hops on the frog's back.

41:04.208 --> 41:06.746
Midway across, the scorpion stings the frog.

41:08.672 --> 41:11.078
The frog looks at him.

41:12.383 --> 41:14.340
"Why would you do that?

41:15.511 --> 41:18.180
Now we're both gonna die."

41:20.474 --> 41:22.467
The scorpion says,

41:25.271 --> 41:27.062
"I can't help it.

41:27.189 --> 41:28.933
I'm a scorpion."

41:31.360 --> 41:34.029
If Tony hadn't thrown a party,

41:35.656 --> 41:38.822
the two of us
would never have been standing at that bar.

41:39.201 --> 41:41.241
(Music and conversation)

41:53.799 --> 41:56.006
You're looking at my brother's trophy?

41:56.135 --> 41:58.804
No, my husband's bimbo.

41:59.889 --> 42:01.513
Walt Braun.

42:01.640 --> 42:03.218
Bonnie Ritten.

42:05.853 --> 42:08.640
And an opportunity presented itself.

42:10.107 --> 42:12.645
Tony had erased you from the will,

42:12.777 --> 42:16.359
and Bonnie wanted the people that hurt her
to pay.

42:17.823 --> 42:19.780
Ain't love grand?

42:26.123 --> 42:29.575
You know, this...this could have all been his.
His and Tony's.

42:32.129 --> 42:34.122
- It's not your fault.
- Sure it is.

42:36.884 --> 42:38.877
I committed the cardinal sin.

42:40.262 --> 42:42.255
I loved one son more than the other.

42:43.391 --> 42:45.383
It's human nature.

42:46.519 --> 42:48.511
We can't deny our feelings.

42:48.646 --> 42:51.766
But you can hide it. And I didn't.

42:53.901 --> 42:55.941
They're my sons.

42:56.070 --> 42:58.062
I made 'em, I raised 'em.

42:59.865 --> 43:01.858
Then one kills the other.

43:01.992 --> 43:03.368
Hey, Sam?

43:03.494 --> 43:05.700
You've still got me.

43:07.915 --> 43:09.908
You know, I should have married your mother.

43:10.042 --> 43:14.918
Well, considering I was six months old
when you guys lit the flame,

43:15.047 --> 43:17.336
a lot of time has passed.

43:17.466 --> 43:19.459
You had plenty of chances.

43:20.886 --> 43:23.212
It just wasn't in the cards, Catherine.

43:25.433 --> 43:27.721
Just wasn't in the cards.
