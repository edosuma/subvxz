WEBVTT

00:02.043 --> 00:03.294
<i>Previously on "The Ark"...</i>

00:03.294 --> 00:06.423
You’re building
a bioshelter farm on the ship!

00:06.423 --> 00:07.841
That’s amazing.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.551
All the other doctors
died in the event,

00:09.551 --> 00:12.595
and I’m left to deal
with all these injured people.

00:14.514 --> 00:16.683
- You work where on the ship?
- Waste Management.

00:16.683 --> 00:19.811
Yeah, well, not anymore.
Alicia Nevins, you are now
Chief Life Support.

00:19.811 --> 00:21.354
- I’m doing another EVA.
- Why?

00:21.354 --> 00:23.356
To figure out
what the hell hit us,
why else?

00:23.356 --> 00:25.025
There’s some kind of crystal
thing wedged in there.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.860
Lane, the glove’s fingers
are nearly off!

00:26.860 --> 00:29.654
Get with Angus on the new
element he’s been analyzing.

00:29.654 --> 00:31.239
It’s an early warning system

00:31.239 --> 00:32.782
in case we come within range
of the element again.

00:32.782 --> 00:34.868
What will it take
to get us back up
to near light speed?

00:34.868 --> 00:38.705
We only have one engine.
If it blows, we’re dead
in the water.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.165
We’re just gonna have
to push it as far as we can.

00:40.165 --> 00:41.541
I’ve seen
your medical records.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.710
They’re too perfect
to be real.

00:43.710 --> 00:47.255
There’s something on this ship
that you need to know about.

00:47.255 --> 00:52.093
<i>I will save this ship
for one simple reason--</i>

00:52.093 --> 00:53.678
<i>to save William Trust.</i>

00:53.678 --> 00:56.598
<i>Now it’s your duty
to keep Trust safe.</i>

01:00.727 --> 01:04.064
Okay, who wants to start
with department briefs. Felix?

01:04.064 --> 01:05.690
I have little to report.

01:05.690 --> 01:09.361
The crew seems
to have settled down
into a peaceful routine,

01:09.361 --> 01:12.072
which frankly
makes me nervous.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.824
Dr. Kabir?
Has Med Bay seen a similar calm?

01:16.951 --> 01:17.827
Dr. Kabir?

01:20.497 --> 01:22.874
Yes?

01:22.874 --> 01:24.501
Oh, uh, yes.

01:24.501 --> 01:26.711
Uh, Med Bay
is thankfully empty.

01:26.711 --> 01:29.881
I’ve only had
a few minor work-related
injuries come in, yeah.

01:29.881 --> 01:32.217
Good. Engineering?

01:32.217 --> 01:36.846
All good. Shuttle repairs
are complete and NEPS
are up and running at 50%.

01:36.846 --> 01:38.515
Oh, wait, wait. 50%?

01:38.515 --> 01:40.433
We won’t get to Prox B
for decades.

01:40.433 --> 01:43.311
Don’t worry.
We’ll run out of fuel
way before that.

01:43.311 --> 01:46.481
I had to eject too much
U-238 during the meltdown.

01:46.481 --> 01:48.900
- How long do we have?
- Why didn’t I know?

01:48.900 --> 01:50.527
Relax. Relax!

01:50.527 --> 01:54.364
Guys, Alicia and I have already
started looking for uranium 238,

01:54.364 --> 01:56.533
and we will find it,
right, Alicia?

01:56.533 --> 01:58.827
Uranium 238 is plentiful
in the universe.

01:58.827 --> 02:01.955
We’re running a spectral
analysis on every chunk
of rock we pass en route.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.374
You know, planets,
planetoids, moons.

02:04.374 --> 02:06.710
So far, nothing,
but I’m not worried yet.

02:06.710 --> 02:10.213
If we don’t find it soon,
we’ll run out of fuel

02:10.213 --> 02:12.257
sometime in the next
two weeks.

02:12.257 --> 02:16.011
Well, then, let’s stop
flapping our lips and get
back to searching, eh?

02:16.011 --> 02:17.220
Okay, this meeting
is adjourned,

02:17.220 --> 02:19.639
but before you guys
go back,

02:19.639 --> 02:22.726
Angus has a surprise
for us in the mess.

02:22.726 --> 02:24.352
All right, well,
you guys go ahead.
I’ll man the bridge.

02:24.352 --> 02:25.979
Let Cogner man the bridge.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.689
Angus will want you
in the mess hall.

02:33.528 --> 02:36.573
No one peek under the napkins.
Just take your seats.

02:42.245 --> 02:46.166
Ladies and gentlemen,
I’m proud to present,

02:46.166 --> 02:48.418
coming straight from Deck 3R,

02:48.418 --> 02:52.797
from a long engagement in
the world-famous bioshelter--

02:52.797 --> 02:55.800
Yes, things to do, places to be.
Get on with it, Angus.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.135
Right.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.554
I’m just trying
to bring some humor.

02:59.554 --> 03:01.806
Never mind.

03:01.806 --> 03:05.268
I present to you all,
the first small harvest

03:05.268 --> 03:07.979
from the bioshelter.

03:07.979 --> 03:09.314
You may remove your napkins.

03:12.650 --> 03:14.986
- Wow.
- This is just the start.

03:14.986 --> 03:16.571
We have lots more coming.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.048
What?

03:35.048 --> 03:36.508
I want to savor every bite.

03:36.508 --> 03:39.719
- Is there a problem with that?
- No, not at all.

03:39.719 --> 03:42.514
Oh, God, I forgot
what real food tastes like.

03:42.514 --> 03:44.224
Right?

03:44.224 --> 03:48.186
Right, well, you take
your time savoring, Alicia.

03:48.186 --> 03:51.189
Some of us have some
uranium to search for.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.692
I’ll be with you
in a few minutes, okay?

03:58.738 --> 04:00.031
Oh.

04:00.031 --> 04:03.868
No, no, no, no, no.
Not now.

04:03.868 --> 04:05.036
Not now, not now.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.774
Dr. Kabir,
I brought you some food.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.776
This is the first time in weeks
I’ve had even a second

04:36.776 --> 04:38.194
to put things
where they belong,

04:38.194 --> 04:40.238
get some semblance
of order in this place.

04:40.238 --> 04:41.781
You missed a special treat
in the mess hall.

04:41.781 --> 04:44.367
Angus shared his first harvest.
I brought you some.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.619
Thank you, Felix.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.247
- Are you okay?
- Yes, fine.

04:49.247 --> 04:51.916
- You need to eat.
- Really?

04:51.916 --> 04:53.543
They didn’t teach us
that in medical school.

04:53.543 --> 04:56.671
I’m fine.
Just a little stressed.

04:56.671 --> 04:59.424
- Haven’t been able to sleep.
- So go get some sleep now.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.301
Why does everyone keep
telling me to get some sleep?

05:01.301 --> 05:02.927
I’ll sleep
when I feel like it.

05:02.927 --> 05:04.929
You just said you’re stressed
because you haven’t slept.

05:04.929 --> 05:06.806
- There’s too much to do.
- There are no patients.

05:06.806 --> 05:09.517
- Yeah, but some could come--
- I’ll watch the shop,

05:09.517 --> 05:11.478
call you when you’re needed.
Take the food. Go.

05:11.478 --> 05:12.604
Now.

05:52.268 --> 05:55.021
Jelena. Jelena.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.690
What? I’m trying to sleep.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.400
Did you see who
I was with last night?

05:58.400 --> 06:00.902
Get over yourself, James.

06:00.902 --> 06:03.446
- I couldn’t give a shit
who you’re sleeping with--
- What? No, no.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.031
Did you see someone
bring me in here?

06:05.031 --> 06:07.409
I was asleep. Good-bye.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.413
Shit.

06:17.502 --> 06:19.087
Come on in.

06:23.341 --> 06:26.094
- You wanted me to come by?
- Have a seat.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.225
You’re wondering
why you’re here.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.810
Well, I kind of feel like

06:33.810 --> 06:35.353
I’ve been called to
the principal’s office.

06:35.353 --> 06:37.605
I asked you here because
I have the confession.

06:37.605 --> 06:41.443
- You do?
- I’ve been hiding contraband.

06:41.443 --> 06:44.404
- Contraband?
- It’s against the rules

06:44.404 --> 06:48.241
to bring any alcoholic
beverages on an ark, but...

06:48.241 --> 06:52.704
...I guess Captain Lester
was a rule-breaker.

06:52.704 --> 06:56.666
- Found that in her stash.
- Well.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.543
Captain Lester
had a good taste in Scotch.

06:58.543 --> 07:00.754
I wouldn’t know.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.839
I’m more of a Kentucky
bourbon girl myself.

07:02.839 --> 07:05.091
How dare you speak
such blasphemy?

07:05.091 --> 07:07.302
Mentioning Kentucky
swamp juice in the same room

07:07.302 --> 07:10.013
as a bottle of Glenn Verbog.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.390
I apologize.
I didn’t realize it was
a religion to you.

07:12.390 --> 07:16.853
Oh, I used to drink
this stuff with my old man
back in the days of NASA

07:16.853 --> 07:20.523
before the whole world
started falling apart.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.317
- He was an astronaut.
- Really?

07:22.317 --> 07:24.486
Did he ever go
anywhere off-world?

07:24.486 --> 07:26.613
Yeah, he went to
the moonbase a few times.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.325
He died there,

07:30.325 --> 07:33.453
when the Eastern Federation
sabotaged it.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.706
Oh. Spencer, I’m sorry.

07:36.706 --> 07:39.709
It was a long time ago.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.795
But it was the reason
I signed up for the GSA.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.547
Yeah, I wanted to continue what
my old man was trying to do,

07:44.547 --> 07:48.718
save humanity from itself
and all that noble crap.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.554
To noble crap.
To your father.

07:58.019 --> 08:01.022
Dr. Hall and I used
to drink together, too.

08:01.022 --> 08:04.067
Kentucky--

08:04.067 --> 08:06.486
the whiskey whose name
I shall not mention

08:06.486 --> 08:09.072
in the same room
as Glenn watchamacallit.

08:09.072 --> 08:11.700
- Dr. Hall?
- Yeah.

08:11.700 --> 08:14.077
He was the doctor that
oversaw the experimentations

08:14.077 --> 08:17.956
- on me and my sister.
- You must hate him.

08:17.956 --> 08:22.627
Actually, he was the closest
thing I ever had to a dad.

08:22.627 --> 08:27.382
- I miss him.
- What happened to him?

08:27.382 --> 08:29.843
Died. Sleeper Podbay 1.

08:29.843 --> 08:33.013
- He was on this ark?
- Yep.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.306
I mean, he’s probably
why I’m on it, too,

08:35.306 --> 08:39.978
though he never admitted to
having anything to do with it.

08:39.978 --> 08:41.563
Well, to Dr. Hall.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.820
So, I have to ask...

08:48.820 --> 08:51.489
Why I invited you here
to have a drink?

08:51.489 --> 08:53.742
Yeah.

08:55.410 --> 08:58.288
To say thank you.

08:58.288 --> 09:03.168
Ever since you went
and revealed all my secrets
and called that vote and...

09:03.168 --> 09:06.629
Oh, those are two main reasons
I’m surprised you invited me.

09:06.629 --> 09:10.842
No, with hindsight,
I think it was a good thing.

09:10.842 --> 09:13.762
Now that there’s
no secrets between us,

09:13.762 --> 09:18.767
you’ve become
a really good number two.

09:18.767 --> 09:23.855
So I wanted to say thank you.
To no secrets between us?

09:25.565 --> 09:26.941
Spencer?

09:30.195 --> 09:31.279
To no secrets.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.246
<i>All council members
to bridge.</i>

09:40.246 --> 09:41.998
I wonder what that’s about.

09:41.998 --> 09:45.168
Probably Brice’s well-honed
Scotch radar going off again.

09:46.795 --> 09:51.591
Oh, hello.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.259
What are you two
all smiley about?

09:53.259 --> 09:55.428
Uh, why did you
call us in here?

09:55.428 --> 09:56.930
Because I am very
pleased to say

09:56.930 --> 10:00.266
I have found a planet
that is rich in uranium-238.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.936
And best of all,
we don’t even have to detour.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.688
It’s directly on our route,
so we just...

10:04.688 --> 10:06.439
...fly down, grab it,

10:06.439 --> 10:08.942
get back up
to near light speed.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.652
Only one problem.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.115
It’s too far away.

10:15.115 --> 10:19.953
We don’t have enough U-238
to get to the U-238.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.246
Oh.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.839
I mean, could we open
the solar sails?

10:30.839 --> 10:32.132
No, the sails are designed

10:32.132 --> 10:34.009
for after we enter
the Proxima system.

10:34.009 --> 10:37.095
And they need the solar winds
from Alpha Centauri, the star.

10:37.095 --> 10:40.598
If we could find a closer star,
would that be any use?

10:40.598 --> 10:42.350
Maybe. Why?

10:42.350 --> 10:43.518
’Cause we’re about to pass

10:43.518 --> 10:44.853
a yellow binary dwarf system.

10:47.856 --> 10:49.441
If we apply
the Tisserand parameter

10:49.441 --> 10:51.943
to the momentum
of the fastest star
in the binary,

10:51.943 --> 10:55.530
it should accelerate us
towards the planet
where the fuel is.

10:55.530 --> 10:57.240
Ooh, and then
we can open the sails

10:57.240 --> 10:59.242
and gain a multiplier
of at least two.

11:01.828 --> 11:06.249
Uh, um, I have a degree
in astrophysics.

11:06.249 --> 11:10.045
Which really explains
why they assigned you
to waste management.

11:10.045 --> 11:13.089
Wait, are you talking about
a gravitational slingshot?

11:13.089 --> 11:14.883
Yes. It’s actually
quite simple.

11:14.883 --> 11:16.968
The momentum gravity
from the star should
act as a catapult,

11:16.968 --> 11:19.012
and get us going
really, really fast.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.513
And then the sails should
get us going even faster.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.099
- I think.
- You think?

11:23.099 --> 11:26.436
Um, give me a few hours
to do some calculations
just to be sure.

11:26.436 --> 11:29.564
- Well, then, get on it.
- All right, well, look,
while she’s doing that,

11:29.564 --> 11:30.982
I’m gonna go
and check the sails,

11:30.982 --> 11:34.235
make sure they weren’t
damaged when we were hit.

11:34.235 --> 11:39.491
I’m-- I’m going to check
the remaining fuel.

11:39.491 --> 11:40.950
Can’t you do that
from here?

11:42.494 --> 11:45.372
Lieutenant Brice,
are you okay?

11:45.372 --> 11:46.790
Yeah, why? What’s up?

11:46.790 --> 11:48.083
I left the mess hall
last night,

11:48.083 --> 11:52.170
found you passed out
in a corridor.

11:52.170 --> 11:54.839
So you’re the one who took me
to the crew quarters.

11:54.839 --> 11:58.301
- Yes.
- You didn’t call for help?

11:58.301 --> 12:00.679
I didn’t want to
get you in trouble.

12:00.679 --> 12:02.305
Thought you just needed
to sleep it off.

12:02.305 --> 12:06.101
- Where’d you get the booze?
- Booze?

12:06.101 --> 12:07.936
Isn’t that why
you passed out?

12:09.270 --> 12:12.524
Okay, uh, firstly,
I’m Scottish,

12:12.524 --> 12:14.401
so I don’t pass out
from booze.

12:14.401 --> 12:19.155
Secondly, this really is
none of your concern. Okay?

12:19.155 --> 12:22.867
Oh, so I should have
taken you to Med Bay,

12:22.867 --> 12:24.828
have Dr. Kabir check you?

12:26.162 --> 12:28.206
Now you listen to me
very closely.

12:28.206 --> 12:30.500
As I’ve just said,
this is none of your concern.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.712
And if you tell anybody
about this, I’ll make your life
on this ship a living hell.

12:33.712 --> 12:35.005
Are we clear?

12:39.676 --> 12:42.053
If you ever talk to me
like that again,

12:42.053 --> 12:44.514
I will knock out those
pretty teeth of yours,
are you clear?

12:44.514 --> 12:46.558
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
You hang on a second, girlie.

12:46.558 --> 12:48.059
Right? You don’t go
sticking your nose

12:48.059 --> 12:49.310
in something you donnae
got no goddamn idea

12:49.310 --> 12:51.146
what youse is
talking about, right?

12:51.146 --> 12:53.148
And while we’re at it...

12:53.148 --> 12:54.357
...how’s about having
a wee bit of respect
for my privacy as well?

12:56.151 --> 13:00.280
- Huh?
- I said, I didn’t understand
a thing you just said.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.615
- But I was speaking English.
- Were you?

13:05.618 --> 13:07.829
All right, fine.

13:07.829 --> 13:13.543
What I was trying to say,
in slightly less
polite terms than this,

13:13.543 --> 13:18.882
was I would like you
to respect my ’effing privacy.

13:21.384 --> 13:24.929
Fine.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.473
I could have been a bit
more respectful about it.

13:26.473 --> 13:29.100
- Okay? Happy?
- Thrilled.

13:29.100 --> 13:34.564
So, Eva, lovely, lovely Eva,

13:34.564 --> 13:38.777
would you please do me a favor
and keep this to yourself?

13:38.777 --> 13:41.571
Because it’s embarrassing,

13:41.571 --> 13:45.742
and quite frankly,
it’s nobody else’s
business but mine.

13:45.742 --> 13:48.787
I don’t know.
Is it contagious?

13:48.787 --> 13:53.208
How do I know
you won’t pass out at a time
that endangers others?

13:53.208 --> 13:56.044
It’s not and I won’t.

13:56.044 --> 13:57.379
Give me your word.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.091
I swear on my mother.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.344
Do you like your mother?

14:04.344 --> 14:05.887
Yes, very much.

14:05.887 --> 14:08.556
Then your secret
is safe with me.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.102
Thank you.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.898
So, uh...

14:16.898 --> 14:19.984
do you really think my teeth
are pretty, then, eh?

14:23.446 --> 14:26.116
You know, you’ve done
your required sessions.

14:26.116 --> 14:27.992
Garnet’s not requiring you
to see me anymore.

14:27.992 --> 14:32.956
Yeah, well, I want to.
I think I need it.

14:32.956 --> 14:36.626
Oh, okay.
What’s bugging you?

14:38.211 --> 14:44.009
Look, what I really
want to know is...

14:44.009 --> 14:46.845
can keeping a secret,
like, a big one,

14:46.845 --> 14:48.346
one you should probably
tell someone,

14:48.346 --> 14:51.683
can holding that in
make you sick?

14:51.683 --> 14:54.144
- You mean physically?
- Yeah.

14:54.144 --> 14:58.940
- Got the runs, do you?
- I didn’t say that.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.400
Well, the answer is yes.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.444
Keeping a big secret
can stress you the hell out,

15:02.444 --> 15:05.113
mess with your stomach,
cause headaches.

15:05.113 --> 15:07.198
So, what’s your big secret?

15:07.198 --> 15:11.453
Well, funny thing
about secrets is...
they’re secret.

15:11.453 --> 15:16.916
Fine, keep it bottled up
inside until you get an ulcer
the size of this ship.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.044
But the best way to prevent that

15:19.044 --> 15:20.462
is to share
the secret with someone,

15:20.462 --> 15:23.798
like maybe a doctor.

15:23.798 --> 15:28.678
Everything that’s said in here
is protected, right?

15:28.678 --> 15:32.057
By some kind of patient-doctor
privilege thing?

15:32.057 --> 15:34.434
Yeah, unless you tell me
that you murdered someone.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.896
William Trust
is stashed in a cryopod

15:37.896 --> 15:40.565
in a hidden room
on this ship.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.444
Cat?

15:46.571 --> 15:47.864
Cat?

15:47.864 --> 15:49.824
William Trust?

15:49.824 --> 15:52.243
Like, the Will Trust
who invented this ’effing
ship that we live on?

15:52.243 --> 15:54.204
- That Will Trust?
- Yeah.

15:56.456 --> 16:00.251
- Is he with anyone?
- Yeah, a woman.

16:00.251 --> 16:04.255
You know, you’re right.
I do feel much better
now that I’ve let that out.

16:04.255 --> 16:06.091
Maybe I should just
go tell Garnet, too.

16:06.091 --> 16:10.220
No, you can’t tell anyone else.
How is he in Ark 1? Why?

16:10.220 --> 16:13.098
All I know is that he was
being protected by Trent

16:13.098 --> 16:14.933
and a bunch of other people
who died in the accident,

16:14.933 --> 16:17.727
and now its fallen on me
to protect him,

16:17.727 --> 16:19.437
although
I don’t know from who.

16:19.437 --> 16:23.108
I’ll tell you from who.
Half the people on this ship.

16:23.108 --> 16:25.110
A lot of people lost
loved ones because of Trust.

16:25.110 --> 16:26.903
Right, but we’re alive
on this ship because of him.

16:26.903 --> 16:31.616
I know. I’m just telling you,
I’ve heard it in many sessions.

16:31.616 --> 16:34.536
There are people
who genuinely hate the man.

16:34.536 --> 16:36.121
Maybe to the point where
they would even kill him.

16:36.121 --> 16:39.165
Well, how about you, doc?

16:39.165 --> 16:42.460
- How do you feel about him?
- Me?

16:42.460 --> 16:44.921
I could take him
or leave him. Why?

16:44.921 --> 16:47.882
Well, because if you were in
the "want to kill him" camp,
we would have a problem.

16:47.882 --> 16:51.845
Oh, I want him very much alive.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.138
You have no idea.

16:53.138 --> 16:56.349
How about Garnet?

16:56.349 --> 16:59.853
Do you think she’s in
the "want to kill him" camp?

16:59.853 --> 17:01.479
I don’t know.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.898
But I don’t know that
she’s not in that camp either,

17:03.898 --> 17:05.233
so you can’t tell her.

17:05.233 --> 17:06.401
You can’t tell anyone else.

17:45.690 --> 17:48.401
Is it true you picked Ark 5
for your own departure

17:48.401 --> 17:50.236
because you’re afraid
the earlier arks

17:50.236 --> 17:52.238
won’t make it
to their destinations?

17:52.238 --> 17:55.283
What kind of asinine
question is that?

17:55.283 --> 17:57.077
I invented those arks,
and I would trust them

17:57.077 --> 17:58.828
with my life,
you two-bit ass of a--

17:58.828 --> 18:00.580
What my husband
is trying to say

18:00.580 --> 18:03.583
is he designed
the earlier ships
to go to closer planets.

18:03.583 --> 18:07.545
So, before we go,
William wants to stay behind

18:07.545 --> 18:09.881
to perfect the faster
than light speed engine.

18:09.881 --> 18:13.593
It’s the only way to ensure
that all the arks can make it
to their destinations

18:13.593 --> 18:18.056
which are much further away
than Proxima B or Ross 128B.

18:18.056 --> 18:22.227
Hopefully,
he’ll accomplish it in time
to go on Ark 5.

18:32.153 --> 18:35.198
So you were supposed
to be on Ark 5.

18:35.198 --> 18:38.827
Then why are you here?

19:52.400 --> 19:55.820
They went, two by two,
into the ark.

20:01.201 --> 20:05.288
Eva and I ran the numbers
and did a computer simulation.
We’re sure it’ll work.

20:05.288 --> 20:09.793
- If Brice can pilot the ark
exactly to my specifications.
- Not a problem.

20:09.793 --> 20:11.461
You sure you can keep it
in my parameters?

20:11.461 --> 20:13.421
Are you sure they’re
the correct parameters?

20:13.421 --> 20:15.382
Oh, my parameters
are always perfect.

20:15.382 --> 20:17.384
Well, then, I will
fit within them perfectly.

20:17.384 --> 20:20.720
- Good.
- Uh, okay.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.848
Um, so, Lieutenant Brice
will pilot us

20:23.848 --> 20:25.975
on a specific trajectory
around the dwarf star.

20:27.602 --> 20:30.230
The momentum from
the orbital gravity of the star

20:30.230 --> 20:31.731
will whip us around
and project us

20:31.731 --> 20:35.026
toward our target planet
and double our speed.

20:35.026 --> 20:38.655
But the trajectory has to be
within two degrees of accuracy.

20:38.655 --> 20:39.739
It will be.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.574
Good, because
if cut it too tight,

20:41.574 --> 20:42.867
then we won’t achieve
escape velocity

20:42.867 --> 20:44.035
from the star’s gravity.

20:44.035 --> 20:46.871
We could be pulled
into the star and burn up.

20:46.871 --> 20:49.499
Exactly, and too wide,
then we won’t gain enough speed

20:49.499 --> 20:50.625
to get to where
we want to go.

20:50.625 --> 20:52.877
So, assuming
this all goes perfectly,

20:52.877 --> 20:55.755
- then we open
the solar sails?
- Yes.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.424
And we’re sure
it’s enough to get us

20:57.424 --> 20:58.717
to the planet
with all the fuel?

20:58.717 --> 21:03.096
- More than enough.
- Thoughts?

21:03.096 --> 21:05.890
Well, I think
we should do it.

21:11.688 --> 21:14.607
- Dr. Kabir?
- We have a problem.

21:14.607 --> 21:15.775
Someone got into
the drug cabinet

21:15.775 --> 21:16.860
and stole most
of the drugs again.

21:16.860 --> 21:19.279
They weren’t stolen.
I took them.

21:19.279 --> 21:21.072
What?

21:21.072 --> 21:23.616
You’re done with
the pills, doctor.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.869
What are you talking about?

21:25.869 --> 21:28.747
I worked in law enforcement
most of my adult life.

21:28.747 --> 21:31.708
I know a drug problem
when I see one.

21:31.708 --> 21:34.252
How dare you? I am a doctor!

21:34.252 --> 21:35.587
I know better than anyone

21:35.587 --> 21:37.422
what narcotics
can do to a person.

21:37.422 --> 21:39.674
We both know I’m not
talking about narcotics.

21:39.674 --> 21:41.801
- I’m talking about amphetamines.
- Whatever.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.429
I know what they do
to a person if abused.

21:44.429 --> 21:45.889
How stupid do you think I am?

21:45.889 --> 21:48.308
Do you think I would
compromise myself like that?

21:48.308 --> 21:49.476
Do you really think
so little of me?

21:49.476 --> 21:51.728
Are you done yelling at me?

21:51.728 --> 21:55.565
Hmm? Notice I’m here alone.

21:55.565 --> 21:57.484
I’m giving you this chance
to beat your addiction.

21:57.484 --> 22:00.820
If you do that,
and I will help you,

22:00.820 --> 22:03.656
this will stay
between the two of us.

22:09.412 --> 22:12.248
I didn’t mean for it
to get out of hand.

22:12.248 --> 22:15.460
But all the other
doctors are dead and
I’m the only one left,

22:15.460 --> 22:17.671
so I started taking them
to stay awake

22:17.671 --> 22:19.964
so I could help my patients.

22:21.174 --> 22:22.133
I know.

22:25.011 --> 22:26.179
But it did get out of hand.

22:26.179 --> 22:28.973
I guess so.

22:31.893 --> 22:34.354
What happens when
I crash from withdrawal?

22:34.354 --> 22:36.189
I have to be on call
at all times.

22:36.189 --> 22:38.566
There are no other doctors.
Who will tend the patients?

22:38.566 --> 22:42.362
- I will.
- That’s nice, Felix.

22:42.362 --> 22:44.364
Look, I know you have
field medic training,

22:44.364 --> 22:48.243
but what if the patient
or patients come in
with something beyond that,

22:48.243 --> 22:51.287
- forgive me,
rudimentary training.
- They won’t.

22:51.287 --> 22:53.748
We’re in a period
of calm right now.

22:53.748 --> 22:55.542
But if something does come in
that I can’t handle,

22:55.542 --> 22:57.836
I’ll call you and
you’ll walk me through it.

23:01.965 --> 23:03.508
Okay?

23:09.014 --> 23:09.889
Okay.

23:16.187 --> 23:18.148
Initializing sun protection now.

23:23.778 --> 23:26.531
Attention all personnel,
brace for acceleration.

23:26.531 --> 23:30.702
Everyone take a seat
or grab ahold of something.

23:31.828 --> 23:36.291
Window opens
in three, two, one.

23:42.964 --> 23:44.799
You hit the marks perfectly,
Lieutenant Brice!

23:44.799 --> 23:50.055
- Was it ever in any doubt?
- Ready to open sails now!

24:08.656 --> 24:14.037
- Whoo! Come on!
- Good going, everyone.

24:14.037 --> 24:17.082
I don’t want to jinx it,
but that couldn’t have gone
more perfectly.

24:20.543 --> 24:23.546
Uh, you jinxed it.
What’s happened?

24:23.546 --> 24:26.091
The star just threw off
a massive solar flare.

24:26.091 --> 24:27.884
It tore a section of
the aft starboard sail.

24:27.884 --> 24:30.053
- Any other damage?
- No.

24:30.053 --> 24:32.639
But we can’t pull out
of the star’s gravity
without all of the sails.

24:32.639 --> 24:35.392
- Meaning?
- Meaning, we’ll be shot back

24:35.392 --> 24:37.394
towards the damn star
and burn up

24:37.394 --> 24:38.937
unless we think
of something very fast.

24:55.495 --> 24:56.746
It’s getting frigging
hot in here.

24:56.746 --> 25:00.792
We’re getting too close
to that star.

25:00.792 --> 25:02.794
I’ve tried to reroute more
energy to climate control,

25:02.794 --> 25:04.129
but it’s already pushed
to the limit.

25:04.129 --> 25:06.172
The heat will be
the least of our problems

25:06.172 --> 25:08.216
if we don’t fix the sail
in the next twenty minutes.

25:08.216 --> 25:11.094
- How do we do that?
- Usually, I would do
a spacewalk

25:11.094 --> 25:13.930
and make the repair.
It would only take
a few Slavinsky clamps.

25:13.930 --> 25:17.809
But we’re too close.
The solar radiation would fry
anyone who goes out there.

25:17.809 --> 25:21.479
- Exactly, but someone has to.
- Great.

25:21.479 --> 25:25.150
So our best hope
is asking someone to do
another suicide mission.

25:25.150 --> 25:27.068
I’ll do it.

25:27.068 --> 25:28.486
What is it with you
and your death wish, buddy?

25:28.486 --> 25:29.821
It’s an not
a death wish--

25:29.821 --> 25:31.489
There is someone
who may be able to do it

25:31.489 --> 25:32.741
without it being a suicide.

25:35.035 --> 25:36.036
Me.

25:37.370 --> 25:38.997
One of my tardigrade
DNA strands

25:38.997 --> 25:41.207
is to withstand
more solar radiation
than any of you.

25:41.207 --> 25:45.003
But you’d be exposed
to at least twice

25:45.003 --> 25:47.339
what an average human
can handle.

25:47.339 --> 25:50.342
- How much can you take?
- I don’t know.
It was never tested.

25:50.342 --> 25:52.135
Dr. Hall was afraid
it would kill me
if it didn’t work.

25:52.135 --> 25:55.388
And what if your changes
don’t protect you? You’ll die.

25:55.388 --> 25:58.433
If I don’t try, we all die.

26:03.271 --> 26:05.357
This is Garnet.
Headed for Airlock 5.

26:05.357 --> 26:08.151
Have a suit and helmet ready
for an immediate EVA.

26:16.576 --> 26:19.913
108 Fahrenheit
and rising in here.
42 degrees Celsius.

26:21.915 --> 26:24.459
I’ve arrived at Mast A-12.

26:26.419 --> 26:27.879
Climbing out
to the damaged sail.

26:31.091 --> 26:33.218
<i>Keep yourself tethered.</i>

26:33.218 --> 26:35.553
That’s rich, coming from
Mister "I know what
I’m doing here."

26:35.553 --> 26:38.598
- Just be careful.
- How you feeling?
Radiation-wise, I mean?

26:38.598 --> 26:43.561
Skin’s feeling
like a bad sunburn.
Tolerable, so far.

26:43.561 --> 26:45.230
<i>Approaching the damage.</i>

26:49.359 --> 26:51.111
Okay.

26:51.111 --> 26:54.239
Now pull the folded piece
from the base of the fold.

26:55.949 --> 26:58.201
Careful not to damage
any of the cells.

27:06.292 --> 27:10.088
Now use your Slavinsky clamps
to reattach the sail

27:10.088 --> 27:15.051
to the mast hold 32B and 32C.

27:27.313 --> 27:28.398
Done.

27:28.398 --> 27:31.401
Okay, I’m going to trim it
from here.

27:33.486 --> 27:35.071
Hold on tight.

27:53.089 --> 27:54.132
Garnet?

27:55.091 --> 27:56.384
Garnet, are you okay?

27:56.384 --> 27:57.719
<i>Not really.
Coming back in.</i>

27:57.719 --> 27:59.179
I’ll meet you at the airlock.

28:16.196 --> 28:19.199
Garnet is in the airlock.
Outer door is sealed.

28:24.371 --> 28:26.289
Garnet, Garnet!

28:31.044 --> 28:33.963
- Garnet.
- She has a pulse.

28:33.963 --> 28:35.590
Help me get her to the med bay.

28:39.719 --> 28:42.430
Thrust is approaching breakaway.

28:42.430 --> 28:45.016
Everyone brace.

28:45.016 --> 28:50.563
Five, four, three, two, one.

28:54.067 --> 28:56.027
Breakaway achieved.

28:56.027 --> 28:59.072
Accelerating!
We just doubled our velocity.

29:01.574 --> 29:02.450
Still accelerating!

29:08.081 --> 29:12.085
Tapering off at 3.8 times
our original speed.

29:13.628 --> 29:14.963
Better than I thought we’d do.

29:14.963 --> 29:16.798
So that means
we’ll make it to the planet.

29:16.798 --> 29:18.133
That it does, Alicia.

29:20.969 --> 29:23.179
- Oh, darn.
- Oh, darn?

29:23.179 --> 29:26.850
Um, remember that sensor
algorithm that Angus
and I came up with

29:26.850 --> 29:29.728
- to detect the substance
that burnt the ship?
- Yes. Yes, what about it?

29:29.728 --> 29:32.063
It just detected loads of it

29:32.063 --> 29:33.398
on the planet
we’re headed towards.

29:35.275 --> 29:37.402
Wait, so you’re saying

29:37.402 --> 29:40.739
we might be jumping out
of the frying pan

29:40.739 --> 29:42.365
and straight into the fire?

29:53.752 --> 29:56.129
Where’s Dr. Kabir?

29:56.129 --> 29:58.089
- Indisposed.
- What? Where is she? Get her!

29:58.089 --> 30:00.467
- Help me get her out
of this pressure suit.
- I won’t ask you again.

30:00.467 --> 30:03.094
- Where is Dr. Kabir?
- I am perfectly capable

30:03.094 --> 30:04.471
of dressing these burns
and running IV for fluids.

30:04.471 --> 30:06.222
That’s all that can be done
for her at this time.

30:06.222 --> 30:07.974
- What are you not telling me?
- What I am telling you,

30:07.974 --> 30:10.101
Lieutenant, is that you
need to go back on that bridge

30:10.101 --> 30:11.311
and figure out our next move.

30:11.311 --> 30:12.812
You’re in charge now.
I’ve got this.

30:12.812 --> 30:14.481
- She better not die.
- She will not.

30:14.481 --> 30:16.649
I will notify you
when she awakens.

30:18.193 --> 30:19.944
Where do we stand now?

30:19.944 --> 30:21.613
Um, the planet that
we’re barreling towards

30:21.613 --> 30:23.656
is full of the substance that
dissolved parts of this ship.

30:23.656 --> 30:25.533
When Angus analyzed it,
he thought it could be a weapon.

30:25.533 --> 30:27.744
From who? We’re the only
people out this far.

30:27.744 --> 30:29.829
Little green men?

30:29.829 --> 30:31.206
More likely just
a natural deposit.

30:31.206 --> 30:33.500
I think we should change course,
just to be safe.

30:33.500 --> 30:35.377
We need the uranium
or we’re dead in space.

30:35.377 --> 30:38.213
- We’ll find it somewhere else.
- And if we don’t, we die.

30:40.048 --> 30:43.218
Well, acting captain,
what do you suggest we do?

30:43.218 --> 30:46.680
Uh, I don’t know.

30:46.680 --> 30:49.015
- What do you think?
- I’ve just told you.

30:49.015 --> 30:51.059
I think we should change course.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.562
Do we have some kind of probe
that we could send ahead?

30:54.562 --> 30:57.524
- No.
- Can the sensors give us
any other clue

30:57.524 --> 30:59.359
- about what we’re flying into?
- No.

30:59.359 --> 31:01.277
What we need
is an advance scout,

31:01.277 --> 31:03.196
but we don’t have
one of those either.

31:03.196 --> 31:05.365
Yes, we do.
The shuttle, right?

31:05.365 --> 31:07.367
I could fly ahead,
recon the situation

31:07.367 --> 31:09.536
before the ark’s anywhere
near the danger zone.

31:09.536 --> 31:12.706
- But the shuttle can’t fly
faster than the ark.
- Actually, it can.

31:12.706 --> 31:14.749
Since it will start already
at the speed we’re traveling,

31:14.749 --> 31:17.711
the shuttle’s boosters
can only add speed
in the vacuum of space.

31:17.711 --> 31:20.005
They should take it
well ahead of Ark One.

31:20.005 --> 31:22.799
Brice, that substance
can melt the entire shuttle
with you in it.

31:22.799 --> 31:25.552
Yeah, well, shuttle’s got
more chance of evading notice
than this great big ship.

31:25.552 --> 31:27.178
You know what
Lieutenant Garnet would say.

31:27.178 --> 31:29.806
Honestly,
I don’t really care, mate.

31:29.806 --> 31:32.350
- You’re in charge now.
- She would say we can’t risk
our only navigator.

31:32.350 --> 31:34.102
Yeah. Ah, but I’ve been
training up Cogner.

31:34.102 --> 31:35.562
She can navigate.
Isn’t that right, Cogner?

31:35.562 --> 31:37.731
Not really. You’ve barely
taught me anything.

31:37.731 --> 31:40.233
- Oh, that--
- Maybe I should take
the shuttle.

31:40.233 --> 31:42.402
- I’m a pilot.
- Look, I’m not being funny,

31:42.402 --> 31:44.738
Lane,
but you’re not quite
the pilot I am.

31:44.738 --> 31:47.240
They’d shoot you out of space
before you’d remember which
yoke controller to pull.

31:47.240 --> 31:51.202
- I am expendable.
- No more than anyone else, man.

31:51.202 --> 31:55.582
- Right,
I’m gonna prep the shuttle.
- Then I’ll go, too, to assist.

31:55.582 --> 31:57.250
- No. No, you won’t.
- We’ll lose
the navigator

31:57.250 --> 31:59.502
- and best engineer.
- It’s fine, Eva. Really.

31:59.502 --> 32:01.588
- I’m not risking
two key people.
- There’s a very good chance

32:01.588 --> 32:04.299
- he won’t make it
halfway to the target.
- Why not?

32:06.301 --> 32:08.345
Because I’m not 100% sure

32:08.345 --> 32:10.096
about the repairs
we made to the shuttle.

32:10.096 --> 32:12.932
He might need me there
to keep it running.

32:12.932 --> 32:14.392
I’ll manage. Thank you.

32:14.392 --> 32:16.436
Then I won’t clear
the shuttle for the flight.

32:16.436 --> 32:21.274
- You already have.
- I don’t care.

32:21.274 --> 32:22.609
I’ll announce to the whole crew

32:22.609 --> 32:25.612
that you took
a broken shuttle and why.

32:25.612 --> 32:28.281
I’ll tell them
everything about you.

32:28.281 --> 32:30.784
What is she talking
about, Brice?

32:30.784 --> 32:35.455
I don’t know. That I’m taking
too many risks maybe.

32:35.455 --> 32:40.335
- Well, she’s not wrong.
- Well, then maybe
she should come.

32:40.335 --> 32:42.003
I didn’t say that.
We need our engineer.

32:42.003 --> 32:44.589
Sasha is as good as I am.

32:46.841 --> 32:47.759
Let’s go, Eva.

32:52.514 --> 32:54.599
So this is what it’s like
being in charge.

33:09.280 --> 33:12.492
- Shouldn’t we put on our suits?
- You feel free.

33:12.492 --> 33:14.202
I don’t intend on needing it.

33:16.371 --> 33:18.331
Shuttle prepared
for departure.

33:18.331 --> 33:20.041
<i>You have a go.
Be careful.</i>

33:20.041 --> 33:22.585
- I always am.
- Never are.

33:34.180 --> 33:37.684
You know, I--
I think I know why you
insisted on coming with me.

33:37.684 --> 33:41.438
- I’m sure you do.
- It’s because you just can’t
get enough of me, isn’t it?

33:41.438 --> 33:44.691
Oh, yeah, that’s exactly why.

33:44.691 --> 33:47.360
I didn’t want
our only shuttle to crash

33:47.360 --> 33:48.570
because you passed out
at the wheel.

33:48.570 --> 33:50.530
- I’m not gonna pass out.
- Good.

33:50.530 --> 33:52.907
Oh, and why the way,
it uses a yoke.

33:52.907 --> 33:55.618
There is no wheel.

33:55.618 --> 33:58.413
It was a figure of speech, genius.

34:02.417 --> 34:05.378
Why don’t you just tell me
what you have wrong with you.

34:05.378 --> 34:08.381
- Um, no.
- Why not?

34:08.381 --> 34:09.966
I’m already keeping
your secret anyway

34:09.966 --> 34:12.218
- without even knowing
what it is.
- How fast do you reckon

34:12.218 --> 34:14.220
I can push this baby?
Because I would really like

34:14.220 --> 34:15.805
to shorten this conversation.

34:15.805 --> 34:17.682
I wouldn’t push it
any more than that.

34:20.185 --> 34:22.604
Oh, very funny.

34:26.775 --> 34:28.276
Shit!

34:32.447 --> 34:34.699
Good. You have a pulse.

34:34.699 --> 34:37.577
Come on, wake up!

34:37.577 --> 34:40.580
I can’t pilot this hunk
of metal alone. Wake up!

34:40.580 --> 34:42.582
<i>Shuttle,
what’s your progress?</i>

34:42.582 --> 34:45.001
All is well.
We’re approaching the target.

34:50.965 --> 34:53.093
<i>Hey, Brice, send me
the approach vectors.</i>

34:53.093 --> 34:55.136
Lieutenant Brice,
he’s-- he’s in the toilet.

34:55.136 --> 34:58.056
He’ll respond in a second--
minute.

35:00.517 --> 35:05.063
Come on, come on.
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

35:05.063 --> 35:09.067
Wake up, dummy. Wake up!

35:14.030 --> 35:18.243
You love me.
You want to kiss--

35:18.243 --> 35:20.662
Aah! Ow!

35:20.662 --> 35:22.664
- Not gonna pass out, huh?
- Ah.

35:22.664 --> 35:24.833
It was a damn good thing
that I was here.

35:24.833 --> 35:27.085
Yeah, I--
I would’ve woken up anyway.

35:27.085 --> 35:28.545
Maybe in a few days.

35:30.213 --> 35:32.382
Ark One wants
the approach vectors.

35:33.258 --> 35:35.218
Right.

35:35.218 --> 35:38.513
Um, we are approaching
the target.

35:38.513 --> 35:40.557
The vector is 5330.

35:40.557 --> 35:42.684
<i>Hey, Brice, next time</i>

35:42.684 --> 35:46.146
<i>go to the toilet
before you leave.</i>

35:46.146 --> 35:50.900
Yeah, uh,
sorry about that, mate.

35:50.900 --> 35:52.193
Um, blame Angus, man.

35:52.193 --> 35:53.695
Those veggies
went right through me.

35:54.904 --> 35:56.156
Brice out.

35:57.907 --> 35:59.951
You told them
I went to the toilet
on a recon mission?

35:59.951 --> 36:03.163
What should I have told them?
That you passed out at the yoke?

36:04.914 --> 36:06.875
Fair point.

36:06.875 --> 36:11.504
Thank you, for, you know,
keeping it quiet.

36:11.504 --> 36:14.549
I won’t continue to do so
if you don’t tell me
what’s going on.

36:14.549 --> 36:16.676
Eva, it’s private, okay?

36:16.676 --> 36:19.721
Ark One, there’s
something you should--

36:19.721 --> 36:22.515
All right, all right. Fine.

36:29.606 --> 36:31.024
I have Klampkins disease.

36:34.110 --> 36:35.653
- It’s a terminal--
- I know what it is.

36:35.653 --> 36:39.282
I knew people who died from it.

36:39.282 --> 36:41.701
There is no cure.

36:44.120 --> 36:45.121
No.

36:47.165 --> 36:49.584
It’s from all that crap that
Trust put in the atmosphere

36:49.584 --> 36:50.960
trying to save the planet.

36:52.587 --> 36:55.590
Just ended up
poisoning people like me.

36:55.590 --> 36:58.468
Do you mind me asking
how long do you have?

37:00.470 --> 37:02.597
Nobody knows.

37:02.597 --> 37:05.558
It kills some people in weeks,
others in years.

37:05.558 --> 37:08.603
Do these passing out episodes
mean it’s getting worse?

37:09.979 --> 37:13.608
Um, no.

37:13.608 --> 37:16.444
No, it comes in clusters,
you know?

37:16.444 --> 37:18.613
Then it goes away again.
Then it comes back.

37:18.613 --> 37:20.615
The last cluster was, um--

37:20.615 --> 37:23.368
it was about a year
before the ark launched.

37:23.368 --> 37:25.412
This explains so much,

37:25.412 --> 37:28.748
like why you have
a goddamn death wish.

37:30.834 --> 37:31.960
Yeah, I guess.

37:33.753 --> 37:36.006
I mean,
I’m gonna die anyway, right?

37:39.342 --> 37:44.806
Look, um,
nobody knows on the ark.

37:44.806 --> 37:48.226
- Not even Dr. Kabir?
- Not exactly, no.

37:48.226 --> 37:51.730
- She might be able to help you.
- Look, Eva, please, please.

37:51.730 --> 37:53.732
There’s nothing she can do,
all right?

37:53.732 --> 37:55.859
And to be perfectly honest,
I don’t--

37:55.859 --> 37:59.821
I don’t really
want to be treated like
some fragile patient

37:59.821 --> 38:01.781
for whatever remains
of my life, you know?

38:01.781 --> 38:03.950
I’d like to
accomplish something.

38:03.950 --> 38:09.080
I’d like to maybe be
instrumental in creating
a new world for humanity.

38:09.080 --> 38:10.206
Who knows?

38:15.378 --> 38:18.214
Otherwise,
what was my life even for?

38:20.675 --> 38:24.179
- Can you understand that?
- Yes.

38:24.179 --> 38:26.306
So you won’t...

38:28.391 --> 38:29.976
You won’t tell anybody?

38:38.234 --> 38:43.323
- Where’s Dr. Kabir?
- Good to see you awake,
Lieutenant Garnet.

38:45.033 --> 38:49.037
I’m caring for you
at this time.

38:49.037 --> 38:51.998
- Why? Where’s Sanji?
- I’m right here.

38:54.209 --> 38:58.046
- Dr. Kabir, there’s no need--
- How’s our patient?

38:58.046 --> 39:02.884
I treated Lieutenant Garnet’s
burns with lubramesithin salve

39:02.884 --> 39:06.721
and gave her
iodinatol for the radiation
with IV fluids.

39:06.721 --> 39:11.267
Well done.
How are you feeling, Sharon?

39:11.267 --> 39:14.479
I’m not dead.

39:14.479 --> 39:17.232
Dr. Hall’s alterations
must have worked.

39:17.232 --> 39:20.402
Well, thanks are owed
to Dr. Hall, I guess.

39:20.402 --> 39:23.530
Yeah. Our mutual friend
was pretty smart.

39:23.530 --> 39:25.407
Yeah.

39:25.407 --> 39:26.700
Dr. Kabir, I have this.

39:26.700 --> 39:28.993
There’s no need
for you to be here.

39:28.993 --> 39:33.081
No offense, Sanji,
but you look as bad as I feel.

39:33.081 --> 39:35.125
- What’s going on?
- She’s just exhausted.

39:35.125 --> 39:37.585
I insisted she take
a much needed day off.

39:37.585 --> 39:40.672
You don’t need
to cover for me, Felix.

39:44.634 --> 39:46.052
Cover for you?

39:48.471 --> 39:52.684
Sharon, I’ve been taking
amphetamines to stay awake.

39:54.811 --> 39:56.771
So many, in fact,
that it became a problem,

39:56.771 --> 39:58.982
but I’m done with that now.

40:01.484 --> 40:04.112
- I should’ve seen it.
- It’s not your fault.

40:04.112 --> 40:08.616
Don’t worry.
I’ll be a mess
for a couple of weeks,

40:08.616 --> 40:12.120
but I’ll get through it.

40:12.120 --> 40:17.375
Um, now if you’ll excuse me,
I’m gonna go vomit some more.

40:21.588 --> 40:26.760
- She’ll get through this.
- I know.

40:26.760 --> 40:29.429
Thanks, Felix,

40:29.429 --> 40:32.807
for both of us.

40:32.807 --> 40:35.393
Any chance you can get me
back on that bridge?

40:35.393 --> 40:38.188
That is not advisable.

40:45.028 --> 40:48.948
So, how about an update?

40:55.872 --> 40:57.832
Good to have you back, Sharon.

40:57.832 --> 40:59.459
Why don’t you sit in
the captain’s chair?

40:59.459 --> 41:02.003
- It’s easier access.
- No, I’m not the captain.

41:02.003 --> 41:04.005
Well, you’re the acting captain.

41:04.005 --> 41:05.674
No one sits in that chair
except the captain.

41:05.674 --> 41:07.425
Take me to my usual spot.

41:11.054 --> 41:12.263
Fill me in.

41:12.263 --> 41:13.556
<i>We’re approaching the planet.</i>

41:13.556 --> 41:15.433
Brice took the shuttle ahead?

41:15.433 --> 41:18.478
- Brice and Eva.
- You were out.

41:18.478 --> 41:21.356
- I had to make decisions.
- Angus’ and my sensor,

41:21.356 --> 41:24.192
it detected a whole bunch of
the stuff that damaged our ship.

41:24.192 --> 41:26.695
We had to find out
if it was safe to approach
the planet, so--

41:26.695 --> 41:29.114
So you sent Brice ahead.

41:29.114 --> 41:34.035
Smart move.
I would’ve done the same.

41:34.035 --> 41:37.247
Wouldn’t have sent Eva,
but, I mean, what can you do?

41:38.915 --> 41:41.209
<i>This is tiny
even for a dwarf planet.</i>

41:45.755 --> 41:47.924
This doesn’t make any sense.

41:47.924 --> 41:49.718
I’ve scanned the whole surface.

41:49.718 --> 41:51.136
We’re not detecting
either element.

41:51.136 --> 41:53.972
No U-238
or the destructive stuff?

41:53.972 --> 41:55.557
Did you check the equipment?

41:55.557 --> 41:59.853
Is that Sharon Garnet I hear?
Glad you’re alive, sister.

41:59.853 --> 42:03.857
- Glad to be alive.
- Welcome back, Lieutenant.

42:03.857 --> 42:07.902
To answer your question,
I ran the scanner check.
It’s working fine.

42:07.902 --> 42:09.404
It detects every other element,

42:09.404 --> 42:11.906
but not U-238 or the acid stuff.

42:11.906 --> 42:13.742
We really have to come up
with a name for that stuff.

42:13.742 --> 42:16.411
- How about Aliciaminium?
- Or not.

42:16.411 --> 42:20.248
The scanners can only scan
line of sight surfaces.

42:20.248 --> 42:22.167
Could it be on the other side
of the planetoid?

42:22.167 --> 42:25.962
- Hey, Brice,
swing around and check.
- Roger that.

42:32.802 --> 42:34.137
- Oh, shit!
- Sranje!

42:34.137 --> 42:36.306
Sorry, I didn’t get that.
Please repeat.

42:36.306 --> 42:41.102
Um, well, you guys aren’t
going to believe this,

42:41.102 --> 42:44.105
but, uh, the U-238
and the Aliciaminium--

42:44.105 --> 42:46.358
They’re on another ship.
