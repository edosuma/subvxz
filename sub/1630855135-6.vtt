13:35.273 --> 13:38.318
EDITH: Is there any
butter in the shops yet, Miep?

13:38.318 --> 13:39.610
MIEP: No, ma'am, no.

13:39.610 --> 13:42.447
I looked today.
There's none.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.325
EDITH: The war will never end.

13:46.325 --> 13:47.910
MIEP: It will.

13:47.910 --> 13:51.330
EDITH: We hear our Queen
telling us to be strong.

13:51.330 --> 13:54.083
But our Queen's in England.

13:54.083 --> 13:59.047
Our Queen has all
the butter she needs.

14:00.798 --> 14:03.342
Yeah.

14:11.809 --> 14:14.687
Danke, danke.

14:26.574 --> 14:30.953
NEIGHBOR: Are you Miep Gies?
MIEP: How can I help you?

14:30.953 --> 14:34.832
NEIGHBOR: This is for you.

14:40.588 --> 14:43.091
It came to me by mistake.
I just moved in upstairs.

14:43.091 --> 14:44.467
MIEP: Oh.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.886
Oh, you're the new neighbor?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.304
I'm Miep.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.306
NEIGHBOR: I know.
It says so right there.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.724
MIEP: Uh-hmm.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.851
Well, if you ever need anything,
don't hesitate to knock.

14:53.851 --> 14:55.937
Bit of an empty
offer these days.

14:55.937 --> 14:59.482
We have nothing
but the thought.

14:59.482 --> 15:02.276
NEIGHBOR: I'll be
seeing you around.

15:09.033 --> 15:11.994
MIEP: Jan, the new
upstairs neighbor is a Nazi.

15:11.994 --> 15:15.623
JAN: I know.
I saw him moving in.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.208
I don't think he can hear us.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.543
MIEP: Are you trying to
test the theory, listening to

15:18.543 --> 15:20.962
Jewish music on
an illegal radio?

15:20.962 --> 15:23.631
Do you want us to get arrested
or our illegal roommate?

15:23.631 --> 15:25.091
Where is he?
Where's Kuno?

15:25.091 --> 15:26.801
JAN: He's in Mrs.
Stoppelman's room.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.386
Everything is fine.

15:28.386 --> 15:30.221
Relax.

15:30.221 --> 15:33.015
MIEP: Everything's fine?

15:33.015 --> 15:36.644
JAN: Well, obviously not,
but we got another baby

15:36.644 --> 15:38.646
to safety in Friesland.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.439
Cute thing.
Little pudge.

15:40.439 --> 15:41.941
Sometimes you have to take
a moment to celebrate

15:41.941 --> 15:43.818
the small wins or else.

15:43.818 --> 15:49.949
MIEP: Oh. See?
No more Mendelssohn.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.617
JAN: But you love Mendelssohn.

15:51.617 --> 15:52.577
MIEP: Jan.

15:52.577 --> 15:54.287
(humming)

15:54.287 --> 15:56.038
JAN: Do you remember when we
went to the Jewish Theatre?

15:56.038 --> 15:57.832
MIEP: Uh-hmm.
JAN: Close your eyes.

15:57.832 --> 15:59.250
Pretend we're there again.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.127
(humming)

16:01.127 --> 16:02.628
MIEP: Remind me tomorrow too.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.505
I'm going to the market before
the potato man and see if

16:04.505 --> 16:06.048
they've got any butter.

16:06.048 --> 16:09.385
I can take that radio to the
annex in the morning and then

16:09.385 --> 16:11.637
I can hand in the one in Mr.
Frank's office to the Nazis,

16:11.637 --> 16:13.931
show them we're complying.

16:15.183 --> 16:16.517
KUNO: Hey. Hey.

16:16.517 --> 16:19.729
MIEP: Oh, Kuno.
Kuno, the man upstairs.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.480
KUNO: Oh, he's a Nazi.
Yeah, Jan told me.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.107
MIEP: Yeah, well, Jan
and I are the only ones

16:23.107 --> 16:25.985
registered as living here,
so if he finds you...

16:25.985 --> 16:27.403
KUNO: Don't worry.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.822
I'll be careful.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.282
JAN: You okay?

16:31.282 --> 16:32.617
KUNO: Got the worst headache.

16:32.617 --> 16:33.701
No idea why.

16:33.701 --> 16:36.287
I'm gonna try
and sleep it off.

16:36.287 --> 16:39.665
MIEP: Okay. Well, let us
know if you need anything.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.169
JAN: You wanna take my radio?

16:43.169 --> 16:45.338
MIEP: Well, it's, it's just
making me nervous, all of it.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.757
JAN: Why?
Why, why now?

16:47.757 --> 16:49.508
Is it because of
the Records Office?

16:49.508 --> 16:51.010
I mean, it was ages ago.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.053
If they were going to arrest me,
they'd have done it by now.

16:52.053 --> 16:54.722
MIEP: Shh!
Be quiet.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.520
I saw a dead
body in the canal.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.272
First Jewish person
I've seen in weeks and

17:03.272 --> 17:07.193
just floating in the canal.

17:07.193 --> 17:10.488
JAN: He probably died in hiding
and didn't know what to do.

17:10.488 --> 17:12.240
MIEP: Hmm?

17:12.240 --> 17:13.658
Is that what the
Resistance does,

17:13.658 --> 17:16.535
just throws people
out like old fish?

17:16.535 --> 17:20.081
JAN: What would you do?
What can you do?

17:25.503 --> 17:28.005
The Germans have their
backs against the wall.

17:28.005 --> 17:29.924
They know the
Allies are coming.

17:29.924 --> 17:32.009
It'll get worse
before it gets better.

17:32.009 --> 17:33.719
MIEP: Do you think it
is gonna get better?

17:33.719 --> 17:35.805
(knocking)

17:35.805 --> 17:37.139
No, it's the neighbor.

17:37.139 --> 17:39.225
I told them to knock if
they needed anything.

17:39.225 --> 17:40.518
JAN: Why on earth
would you do that?

17:40.518 --> 17:42.979
MIEP: 'Cause that's
what you say to neighbors.

17:44.855 --> 17:47.316
One second!

17:52.863 --> 17:54.323
KONING: Mrs. Gies?

17:54.323 --> 17:55.783
JAN: Hi.
Can I help at all?

17:55.783 --> 17:57.159
SCHEUBLEIN: We're here
with the Omnia Trust for the

17:57.159 --> 17:59.203
liquidation of Jewish assets.

17:59.203 --> 18:01.539
We have this address
listed as belonging to a...

18:01.539 --> 18:03.541
KONING: Henriedte Stoppelman.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.459
JAN: Oh, that,
that, that's an error.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.211
She's not lived
here for a long time.

18:07.211 --> 18:10.256
MIEP: Uh-hmm.
SCHEUBLEIN: That right?

18:13.384 --> 18:20.182
(singing in native language)

18:25.563 --> 18:27.189
(door opens)

18:27.189 --> 18:30.276
(baby crying)

18:30.276 --> 18:31.569
BETJE: They're here.

18:31.569 --> 18:34.405
(speaking German)

18:34.405 --> 18:36.032
LIESJE: It's all right.

18:36.032 --> 18:37.992
(speaking German)

18:37.992 --> 18:39.243
GERMAN SOLDIER: Everybody up!

18:39.243 --> 18:41.871
This building is
officially closed!

18:41.871 --> 18:43.372
All children to be processed

18:43.372 --> 18:46.584
for transport to the
camps, immediately!

18:46.584 --> 18:48.294
Then you will be processed!

18:48.294 --> 18:49.962
Come on!
Wake them up!

18:49.962 --> 18:51.547
Dress them up!
Right now!

18:51.547 --> 18:53.591
(speaking German)

18:53.591 --> 18:55.343
KONING: So the only
residents listed here are

18:55.343 --> 18:57.928
you, Jan Gies,
and you, Miep Gies.

18:57.928 --> 18:59.096
MIEP: Uh-hmm.
KONING: Correct?

18:59.096 --> 19:00.640
JAN: Yes.
That's correct.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.141
SCHEUBLEIN: Which one of these
rooms did the old lady sleep in?

19:02.141 --> 19:03.642
JAN: Um, well.

19:03.642 --> 19:08.773
MIEP: My, my cousin is in,
uh, in, in insurance as well.

19:08.773 --> 19:11.609
KONING: Good for your cousin.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.534
SCHEUBLEIN: So this
is your furniture?

19:20.534 --> 19:22.078
MIEP: It is.

19:22.078 --> 19:24.664
SCHEUBLEIN: You and my
grandma have similar taste.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.457
MIEP: Oh, you came here
to insult my taste then

19:26.457 --> 19:28.668
take my furniture?

19:31.629 --> 19:34.924
SCHEUBLEIN: All right. Next.

19:44.809 --> 19:49.230
KONING: Sofa, two armchairs.

19:49.230 --> 19:51.649
GERMAN SOLDIER: Come on!
Come on! Move quickly!

19:51.649 --> 19:53.109
Down here!

19:53.109 --> 19:54.777
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

19:54.777 --> 19:56.737
Come on!
Quickly now!

19:56.737 --> 20:02.993
(speaking German)

20:03.828 --> 20:08.999
(speaking German)

20:09.667 --> 20:10.876
LIESJE: Come on. Let's go.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.838
(speaking German)

20:14.630 --> 20:17.049
LIESJE: Run to the Teacher's
house as fast as you can.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.093
Knock on his door,
then hide yourselves.

20:19.093 --> 20:20.386
Go, go, go, go!

20:20.386 --> 20:22.638
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

20:22.638 --> 20:26.517
Get him. Get him.
Get him. Go.

20:26.517 --> 20:30.354
(baby crying)

20:41.157 --> 20:44.577
SCHEUBLEIN: You need
to come in here.

20:44.577 --> 20:47.580
Didn't Horvath say he
needed a dining set for four?

20:47.580 --> 20:52.293
KONING: He wants oak.
That's pine.

21:00.468 --> 21:01.719
This your room?

21:01.719 --> 21:04.054
MIEP: Uh-hmm.

21:05.639 --> 21:08.100
JAN: Is that necessary?

21:08.100 --> 21:10.936
SCHEUBLEIN: Miss?

21:11.437 --> 21:13.230
Circumstances of
Mrs. Stoppelberg

21:13.230 --> 21:14.356
leaving the domicile.

21:14.356 --> 21:15.858
MIEP: Stoppelman.

21:15.858 --> 21:18.319
SCHEUBLEIN: She moved, she
fled, she was relocated, what?

21:18.319 --> 21:22.364
JAN: Well, we came home
one day and she was gone.

21:23.365 --> 21:26.786
SCHEUBLEIN: Good thing you had
"all your own furniture", huh?

21:28.245 --> 21:30.748
This is theft, what
you're doing here.

21:30.748 --> 21:32.208
This isn't your stuff.

21:32.208 --> 21:34.126
MIEP: Come on.
She left it.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.045
And a girl needs
something to sit on.

21:36.045 --> 21:38.672
Are you just
gonna take it all?

21:38.672 --> 21:40.966
KONING: I think
we got everything.

21:42.718 --> 21:43.969
SCHEUBLEIN: Pending review,

21:43.969 --> 21:46.680
we'll be back to collect
the old Jew's furniture.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.141
You'll be hearing from us.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.606
KUNO: Oh, what the hell?

21:55.606 --> 21:57.233
MIEP: They came in here
like they owned the place!

21:57.233 --> 21:59.485
JAN: Well, they do now.

21:59.485 --> 22:00.986
MIEP: Are you all right?

22:00.986 --> 22:03.405
KUNO: Um, no.
No, I can't stop shaking.

22:03.405 --> 22:04.740
JAN: Well done, mate.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.659
Missed you by millimeters.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.161
(knocking)

22:12.122 --> 22:13.916
MIEP: Back so soon?

22:13.916 --> 22:15.084
Max?

22:15.084 --> 22:17.503
MAX: I need your help.

22:21.549 --> 22:24.802
JAN: So you hid in a closet
and they didn't find you?

22:24.802 --> 22:27.471
LIESJE: I know,
but we were trapped.

22:27.471 --> 22:30.140
They were there for hours,
pulling the children out.

22:30.140 --> 22:33.644
When it went silent, I
snuck out and called Max.

22:33.644 --> 22:36.480
Betje wanted to
turn herself in,

22:36.480 --> 22:38.107
go with the kids to Westerbork.

22:38.107 --> 22:39.650
BETJE: How many children
did we care for and then

22:39.650 --> 22:41.193
send off into the hands
of those sadists?

22:41.193 --> 22:42.611
LIESJE: We had no choice.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.196
JAN: You saved
countless children.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.490
BETJE: And watched
thousands be sent away to die.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.742
And the Jewish Council
said that we'd be safe.

22:48.742 --> 22:51.120
MIEP: Tea, you
could use some tea.

22:51.412 --> 22:53.205
MAX: My wife and I have a
hiding place lined up

22:53.205 --> 22:54.415
in the country,

22:54.415 --> 22:55.749
but it's impossible to
get out of the city.

22:55.749 --> 22:57.668
JAN: Maybe I can help.

22:57.668 --> 23:00.296
But you should have Stella
come and stay here tonight.

23:00.296 --> 23:02.381
She's not safe in
your house anymore.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.841
MIEP: Will you help me
with the tea, please?

23:03.841 --> 23:06.385
JAN: Yeah.

23:16.312 --> 23:18.439
MIEP: Yeah, what's your plan?

23:18.439 --> 23:20.900
JAN: I haven't quite
figured it out yet.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.027
MIEP: Try again.

23:23.527 --> 23:26.155
JAN: Well, the Germans have
shut down transportation,

23:26.155 --> 23:27.990
beefed up checkpoints.

23:27.990 --> 23:29.825
There's no getting
out of the city.

23:29.825 --> 23:31.327
MIEP: What?

23:31.327 --> 23:32.912
So they're just
gonna stay here?

23:32.912 --> 23:34.246
Four more people?

23:34.246 --> 23:35.831
That can't be the plan.

23:35.831 --> 23:38.042
Not with Omnia agents barging
in and the neighbor upstairs.

23:38.042 --> 23:39.668
Something's gonna happen.

23:39.668 --> 23:41.086
JAN: Miep.

23:41.086 --> 23:43.589
Things are happening
regardless of what we do.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.257
BETJE: They're
taking children!

23:45.257 --> 23:46.759
MIEP: Oh, my God!

23:46.759 --> 23:48.135
BETJE: I never
believed we were safe there.

23:48.135 --> 23:49.553
MAX: Look, we
know the opposition.

23:49.553 --> 23:50.721
BETJE: Doctors and nurses
were supposed to be safe.

23:50.721 --> 23:52.181
No one was safe.

23:52.181 --> 23:53.557
MAX: We told you that because
we thought it was true.

23:53.557 --> 23:55.100
We got no prior warning.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.685
Now, they're dismantling
the Jewish Council and

23:56.685 --> 23:57.811
will be after us next.

23:57.811 --> 23:59.355
MIEP: Shh! Shh!

23:59.355 --> 24:02.149
Please, there's, there's an
NSB Officer living upstairs.

24:02.149 --> 24:05.277
BETJE: There's an
NSB Officer upstairs?

24:05.277 --> 24:06.820
Max, I thought you
said this was safe.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.822
MAX: I thought it was. Jan?

24:08.822 --> 24:10.658
JAN: It's as safe a place
as we have at the moment.

24:10.658 --> 24:13.786
As long as we're all quiet,
we'll all be safe.

24:13.786 --> 24:16.580
LIESJE: Oh, God.

24:16.580 --> 24:19.625
MIEP: Kuno?

24:24.254 --> 24:25.756
BETJE: I applied cold
compresses all night,

24:25.756 --> 24:27.591
but his temperature
just won't go down.

24:27.591 --> 24:30.260
It could be a migraine,
a sinus infection, a virus.

24:30.260 --> 24:32.179
But worst-case scenario,
it's meningitis,

24:32.179 --> 24:34.890
which could be deadly
and contagious.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.141
LIESJE: I think we should
take him to a hospital.

24:36.141 --> 24:38.060
MIEP: No.
No, we can't.

24:38.060 --> 24:39.061
He's hiding here.

24:39.061 --> 24:40.437
He's wanted by
the Green Police.

24:40.437 --> 24:41.689
Can't you take care of him?

24:41.689 --> 24:42.564
BETJE: Very little to be
done if we don't know

24:42.564 --> 24:43.899
the cause of the problem.

24:43.899 --> 24:45.859
LIESJE: We can, we can
hold out for a while,

24:45.859 --> 24:47.027
see if he gets any better.

24:47.027 --> 24:48.362
MIEP: Yeah.

24:48.362 --> 24:49.488
LIESJE: Can we have
some fresh water?

24:49.488 --> 24:50.739
MIEP: Yeah.

24:50.739 --> 24:51.573
BETJE: Oh, and if you
have any willow bark,

24:51.573 --> 24:52.950
that would be good.

24:52.950 --> 24:54.076
And maybe some alcohol.

24:54.076 --> 24:55.661
MIEP: What kind?
Rubbing alcohol?

24:55.661 --> 24:57.913
BETJE: Any kind.
Brandy, gin, rye.

24:57.913 --> 25:00.624
It's for me.

25:03.877 --> 25:06.755
(gasping)

25:06.755 --> 25:08.716
MIEP: Stella?
When did you get here?

25:08.716 --> 25:11.051
STELLA: Max sent
for me last night.

25:11.051 --> 25:12.594
Do you happen to
have an extra towel?

25:12.594 --> 25:13.929
MIEP: Yeah. Yeah.
In the cabinet.

25:13.929 --> 25:16.557
STELLA: Thank you.

25:17.641 --> 25:19.893
MIEP: Anyone else in the
house I should know about?

25:19.893 --> 25:21.729
JAN: Look, I'm gonna
speak to Bram, okay?

25:21.729 --> 25:23.022
I'll get everyone out.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.190
MIEP: Yeah. Can you get
Kuno some willow bark?

25:25.190 --> 25:28.193
JAN: Yes.
Anything else?

25:28.193 --> 25:30.404
MIEP: What do we do if Kuno...

25:30.404 --> 25:34.366
JAN: If he dies?
I have no idea.

25:34.366 --> 25:37.536
MIEP: Neither do I.
No clue.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.038
JAN: All right.

25:39.038 --> 25:42.416
I'll get some
willow bark, okay?

25:46.587 --> 25:48.380
MIEP: Okay.
I have to go to work.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.882
Don't make any noise.

25:49.882 --> 25:52.134
We don't know how
much he can hear.

25:52.134 --> 25:53.302
Only walk around in socks.

25:53.302 --> 25:55.721
Don't flush the toilet.
Don't run any water.

25:55.721 --> 25:58.056
No one is supposed to be here.

25:58.056 --> 26:02.019
Just don't let him die.

26:04.646 --> 26:06.231
AUGUSTE: Ow! Ow!

26:06.231 --> 26:07.775
FRITZ: Please, be still.

26:07.775 --> 26:10.194
AUGUSTE: Stop jabbing that thing
in my gum and I'll stay still.

26:10.194 --> 26:12.529
HERMANN: So I'm assuming
that they'll land in Spain.

26:12.529 --> 26:13.947
ANNE: Capital of
Spain is Madrid.

26:13.947 --> 26:15.282
OTTO: Spain or Portugal.

26:15.282 --> 26:16.784
ANNE: Capital of
Portugal is Lisbon.

26:16.784 --> 26:18.368
PETER: What are you doing?
ANNE: I'm remembering things.

26:18.368 --> 26:20.204
When I get back,
I'm not held back.

26:20.204 --> 26:21.997
PETER: That's a good idea.
ANNE: I know.

26:21.997 --> 26:23.874
OTTO: Although, the best thing
news would be France, no?

26:23.874 --> 26:24.708
ANNE: Paris!
PETER: Paris!

26:24.708 --> 26:26.084
MARGOT: Oh, Paris.

26:26.084 --> 26:28.420
Mama, when we get out of here,
we should go to Paris.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.297
We could go see
where Renoir lived.

26:30.297 --> 26:31.924
EDITH: Why would
I want to do that?

26:31.924 --> 26:33.801
MARGOT: You love Renoir.

26:33.801 --> 26:35.219
EDITH: Do I love Renoir?

26:35.219 --> 26:37.471
FRITZ: Miep, uh, the radio.
Please, set it here.

26:37.471 --> 26:38.972
MIEP: Oh, God, no.
I forgot it.

26:38.972 --> 26:40.224
I left it at home.

26:40.224 --> 26:41.433
PETER: Well, if we can't
listen downstairs, then.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.518
MIEP: It slipped my mind.

26:42.518 --> 26:43.811
I, I came for
the shopping list.

26:43.811 --> 26:45.312
AUGUSTE: Uh, Edith has it.

26:45.312 --> 26:46.605
HERMANN: So now we
don't have a radio?

26:46.605 --> 26:47.815
FRITZ: Please, Van Pels.

26:47.815 --> 26:49.441
MARGOT: Mama?
Shopping list.

26:49.441 --> 26:50.818
EDITH: I don't have it.

26:50.818 --> 26:52.236
AUGUSTE: Yes, you do.
Yes, you do.

26:52.236 --> 26:53.237
FRITZ: I'm saying, you're
not gonna get information.

26:53.237 --> 26:55.656
EDITH: Oh. Yes, I have it. Right.

26:55.656 --> 26:57.699
I can't find my pot.
Did you wash it?

26:57.699 --> 27:00.994
MARGOT: No. Mama, it's on the
counter, right next to you.

27:00.994 --> 27:02.204
MIEP: Edith,
Gerrit's coming today.

27:02.204 --> 27:03.455
HERMANN: Miep.
EDITH: Gerrit?

27:03.455 --> 27:04.873
MIEP: The potato man.

27:04.873 --> 27:06.208
HERMANN: Miep, the radio is
of the utmost importance

27:06.208 --> 27:07.167
right now.

27:07.167 --> 27:08.293
The Allies could be days away.

27:08.293 --> 27:09.628
We need to know what's what.

27:09.628 --> 27:10.921
EDITH: Potato man, yeah.

27:10.921 --> 27:12.005
HERMANN: Again.
I'm, I'm speaking for myself,

27:12.005 --> 27:13.757
but news is more
important than food.

27:13.757 --> 27:15.008
PETER: Oh, no, no, no.

27:15.008 --> 27:16.426
He's definitely
speaking for himself, Miep.

27:16.426 --> 27:18.095
MIEP: Are there any good
potatoes left in the attic?

27:18.095 --> 27:19.471
EDITH: Anne, Peter?

27:19.471 --> 27:20.848
Go upstairs and see if there
are any good potatoes,

27:20.848 --> 27:22.391
will you?

27:22.391 --> 27:23.892
Get the pack of beans while
you're up there too, will you?

27:23.892 --> 27:25.310
MIEP: The moldy ones that
are salvageable are good, too.

27:25.310 --> 27:27.563
OTTO: Well, the South
of France makes sense.

27:27.563 --> 27:28.939
But Normandy?

27:28.939 --> 27:30.023
EDITH: I, I can't find my pot.

27:30.023 --> 27:32.192
MIEP: Edith, it's there.

27:32.192 --> 27:33.735
ANNE: Mother!
There's a...

27:33.735 --> 27:35.112
MIEP: Anne! Anne!

27:35.112 --> 27:36.822
The office is opening soon,
please stop shouting!

27:36.822 --> 27:38.115
ANNE: Sorry!

27:38.115 --> 27:39.783
(beans rattling)

27:39.783 --> 27:43.620
MIEP: Stop it! Stop it!

27:43.620 --> 27:45.455
(laughing)

27:45.455 --> 27:47.040
Stop that now!

27:47.040 --> 27:48.959
PETER: Come on!
Stop it!

27:48.959 --> 27:50.419
MIEP: It's not funny!
They can hear this!

27:50.419 --> 27:52.379
Gerrit could be down there.

27:52.629 --> 27:56.592
MAN: Hello? Hello?

27:57.009 --> 28:00.262
MIEP: That's Gerrit.
Now, just clean it up.

28:00.262 --> 28:02.306
Don't, don't, don't, don't.
It'll make too much noise.

28:02.306 --> 28:05.517
Just do nothing.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.186
Gerrit?

28:08.186 --> 28:09.730
I'm glad I didn't miss you!

28:09.730 --> 28:12.482
JOHANNES: Shh!
It's the NSB man.

28:12.482 --> 28:14.026
The one who was
blackmailing Otto.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.402
MIEP: What?
Tonny Ahlers?

28:15.402 --> 28:17.654
JOHANNES: He said he won't
leave until he sees you.

28:22.868 --> 28:24.620
MIEP: I told you once and
I'm not telling you again.

28:24.620 --> 28:27.247
I don't know
where Mr. Frank is.

28:27.247 --> 28:29.750
TONNY: Of course.
Lost in Switzerland.

28:29.750 --> 28:31.126
MIEP: Unless you're here
for sausage spices,

28:31.126 --> 28:32.252
I have nothing for you.

28:32.252 --> 28:33.378
Can you please go?

28:33.378 --> 28:36.340
TONNY: Times have changed.
Look around.

28:36.340 --> 28:39.343
It's a different city.
No more dirty Jews.

28:39.343 --> 28:42.220
MIEP: Well, congratulations.

28:42.220 --> 28:44.765
TONNY: Scarcity sets the
market price, you know?

28:44.765 --> 28:46.350
You can now get a lot
more money for turning in

28:46.350 --> 28:48.101
a Jew in hiding.

28:48.101 --> 28:49.394
Come on.

28:49.394 --> 28:52.064
You know where the Franks are.
I know you do.

28:52.064 --> 28:53.315
I'm going to find
someone who does.

28:53.315 --> 28:54.566
It might as well be you.

28:54.566 --> 28:57.486
Your cut would be substantial.

29:00.989 --> 29:03.992
Think about it.

29:16.463 --> 29:19.091
MIEP: He said that...
JOHANNES: I heard.

29:19.091 --> 29:22.844
You don't think he
suspects they're here at all?

29:23.303 --> 29:26.056
GERRIT: Uh, hello?
MIEP: Gerrit.

29:26.056 --> 29:29.142
Hey, Gerrit, I was, I
was worried I missed you.

29:31.728 --> 29:32.938
GERRIT: That man
who just left,

29:32.938 --> 29:34.272
he was hovering around
when I got here.

29:34.272 --> 29:36.274
I, I stalled.

29:36.274 --> 29:38.151
I didn't think you'd want him
to see that you have such a,

29:38.151 --> 29:41.029
a large standing order.

29:42.072 --> 29:44.574
Watch out for him.
He's bad news.

29:44.574 --> 29:47.452
Have a good day.
Have a good one.

29:48.954 --> 29:51.498
JOHANNES: Was Gerrit saying
what I think he was saying?

29:51.498 --> 29:53.041
MIEP: Like it's
common knowledge?

29:53.041 --> 29:55.335
Like "Because of the
Jews you're hiding."

29:55.877 --> 29:58.213
JOHANNES: Maybe
Tonny Ahlers knows that too?

29:58.213 --> 29:59.965
MIEP: I don't know.
I don't, I don't think so.

29:59.965 --> 30:01.550
I mean, why
would he cut me in?

30:01.550 --> 30:05.721
Oh, I mean, this is so bad.

30:06.096 --> 30:07.681
What?

30:07.681 --> 30:10.976
What's wrong?

30:10.976 --> 30:14.438
Mrs. Frank, you can't be here.

30:17.190 --> 30:20.027
EDITH: I just wanted to
get away for a minute.

30:20.027 --> 30:23.238
Then I saw the
sunlight in the hall.

30:23.238 --> 30:28.243
I just needed a
little sunlight.

30:44.384 --> 30:45.802
Can I talk to you?

30:45.802 --> 30:47.512
MIEP: Of course.

30:47.512 --> 30:49.264
Of course, Mrs. Frank,
but inside.

30:49.264 --> 30:50.474
EDITH: No. No.

30:50.474 --> 30:52.476
I can't be in there
for another second.

30:52.476 --> 30:55.854
With their nonstop chattering
and planning and cheering

30:55.854 --> 30:58.774
about the end of the war as
if it's already happened.

30:58.774 --> 31:02.360
As if our girls are already
free and out of danger.

31:04.154 --> 31:06.364
I feel so ashamed.

31:06.364 --> 31:09.076
MIEP: Ashamed?
EDITH: Yeah.

31:10.035 --> 31:12.746
I have this bad feeling, Miep.

31:12.746 --> 31:15.207
I can't shake it.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.334
I have this dark hole in
my stomach that tells me

31:17.334 --> 31:19.961
this war will never end.

31:19.961 --> 31:23.590
And Margot looks at me and
Anne looks at me, and, and

31:23.590 --> 31:28.386
they have so much light in
their eyes, so much hope now,

31:29.137 --> 31:34.392
and I can't look back at them.

31:34.392 --> 31:37.229
I'll kill it.

31:37.229 --> 31:41.066
I'll destroy their hope
if they look in my eyes.

31:42.818 --> 31:45.612
It's been two years, Miep.

31:45.612 --> 31:48.990
Two years since
I've been outside.

31:50.617 --> 31:53.537
Is it better?

31:53.537 --> 31:57.791
Tell me it's better out there.

32:01.002 --> 32:05.257
MIEP: It's much better
that you're inside right now.

32:05.257 --> 32:07.884
EDITH: Yeah.

What happened?

MIEP: Mrs. Frank just walked
right out into the office.

33:34.888 --> 33:36.431
JOHANNES: I nearly
fell over dead.

33:36.431 --> 33:38.016
BEP: Why would she do that?

stressed and sloppy.

I mean, we're all
getting sloppy.

33:41.895 --> 33:43.980

the potato man.

I mean, he didn't
say it outright but.

JOHANNES: We have
to be more careful...

33:47.484 --> 33:48.735
VICTOR: How much
more careful can we be?

We have to feed people.

people outside the city?

MIEP: But how would
we get them there?

34:02.332 --> 34:04.125
Mr. Frank won't let
them travel separately.

34:04.125 --> 34:06.169
We can't just move eight
people onto the street.

34:08.505 --> 34:10.131

really the answer?

going to answer that?

MIEP: Opekta.

34:21.518 --> 34:24.104
Huh? Don't do anything.

34:24.104 --> 34:25.480
Tell them to stay put.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.482
Please!
I'll be right there.

34:27.482 --> 34:28.775

34:28.775 --> 34:29.859

34:29.859 --> 34:32.404
MIEP: Nothing.
It's no one.

34:35.365 --> 34:38.285
HAGEN: Prisoner to check in.
Stand still.

34:38.285 --> 34:40.412
JAN: I work for
the city council.

34:40.412 --> 34:41.454
I'm a social worker.

34:41.454 --> 34:42.998

I have important work to do.

We need to check him in.

BORST: Tell me,
Mr. Social Worker,

35:01.308 --> 35:02.934
do you work with Bram Becker?

35:02.934 --> 35:04.936
JAN: Yes.
I told you.

35:06.521 --> 35:09.649
BORST: Yeah.
I bet you do.

35:12.235 --> 35:14.070
Run.

35:14.070 --> 35:16.364
I'll say I was overpowered by
an unidentified Dutch citizen.

35:16.364 --> 35:17.699
He escaped police custody.

35:17.699 --> 35:19.576
JAN: What?

35:19.576 --> 35:21.119
If I run, you're gonna
shoot me in the back.

35:21.119 --> 35:24.122
BORST: Go, stupid,
before someone sees.

35:24.122 --> 35:27.375
Tell Bram Becker I said hello.

35:34.591 --> 35:36.009
MAX: I tried to tell them no.

35:36.009 --> 35:37.260
STELLA: I think
they should take him.

35:37.260 --> 35:38.511
BETJE: All right.
Here we go.

35:38.511 --> 35:39.554
MIEP: No, no, no, no.

35:39.554 --> 35:40.597
You can't take him
to the hospital.

35:40.597 --> 35:41.931
BETJE: We are.
We have to.

35:41.931 --> 35:43.350
MIEP: Jan will be back
soon with the willow bark.

35:43.350 --> 35:44.392
BETJE: It's beyond the
point of needing willow bark.

35:44.392 --> 35:45.602
LIESJE: He needs proper care.

35:45.602 --> 35:47.395
MIEP: Are you sure he's dying?
BETJE: What?

35:47.395 --> 35:48.897
LIESJE: No, but we
don't know what it is.

35:48.897 --> 35:50.732
MIEP: I, I know, but if he
gets caught, he will die.

35:50.732 --> 35:52.650
And we will get arrested,
and you will get arrested,

35:52.650 --> 35:55.320
and so will his mother and,
and his mother, our landlady,

35:55.320 --> 35:58.907
and eight more people, children,
and they will all die.

35:58.907 --> 35:59.824
So many people.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.076
So if, there he is...

36:01.076 --> 36:02.285
Jan, Jan, the willow bark.

36:02.285 --> 36:03.787
BETJE: I told you he's
beyond the point of

36:03.787 --> 36:04.704
needing willow bark.

36:04.704 --> 36:06.206
MIEP: Try it. Jan?

36:06.206 --> 36:08.875
JAN: I don't got it.

36:08.875 --> 36:10.377
MIEP: What?

36:10.377 --> 36:12.087
I asked you to do one thing.

36:12.087 --> 36:13.421

Everyone's fine. Fine.

Everything's fine. Sorry.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.290
I, I dropped the
iron on my foot.

36:49.290 --> 36:50.792
Screamed like a banshee.

MIEP: Thank you.

37:06.182 --> 37:07.851
KUNO: It was like a hammer
banging on the inside of

37:07.851 --> 37:11.354
my face, then it just went away.

37:11.354 --> 37:13.022
LIESJE: We think it
was an abscess with a

37:13.022 --> 37:15.024
massive infection that burst.

37:15.024 --> 37:16.734
We need to stay with him
tonight to make sure the

37:16.734 --> 37:20.738
infection is not worse,
but it seems he's good.

One thing.

37:45.346 --> 37:46.473
JAN: Right.

37:46.473 --> 37:47.891
MIEP: I am feeding
eight Jews at work.

37:47.891 --> 37:49.684
You bring five more people
into my home and you can't

37:49.684 --> 37:51.311
find the time to
get some willow bark?

37:51.311 --> 37:53.813
JAN: I did get some willow
bark and then I was arrested.

37:53.813 --> 37:55.857
MIEP: What?

37:55.857 --> 37:57.817
JAN: It's okay.
They let me go.

37:57.817 --> 38:00.820
Just took my bike,
for the tires.

38:00.820 --> 38:02.822
MIEP: Why did they arrest you?

38:02.822 --> 38:04.365
JAN: Because they can, Miep.

38:04.365 --> 38:06.743
MIEP: What did you do?
JAN: Nothing.

38:06.743 --> 38:08.369
I told them I needed my
bike and suddenly they

38:08.369 --> 38:10.205
deemed me insubordinate.

38:10.205 --> 38:12.081
MIEP: Were you?
What did you say?

38:12.081 --> 38:13.500
JAN: Why are you
interrogating me?

38:13.500 --> 38:15.043
MIEP: Because all day I've
been picturing us dragging

38:15.043 --> 38:18.755
Kuno's dead body out here and
throwing it into the canal!

38:18.755 --> 38:21.883
I literally don't know
what else we would do.

38:21.883 --> 38:23.218

the wins or, Jan...

38:36.272 --> 38:40.527
Mrs. Frank walked
out the Annex today.

38:40.527 --> 38:42.195
JAN: What?

38:42.195 --> 38:44.864
MIEP: Yeah.
She just walked right out.

38:44.864 --> 38:46.282
She could have
gone into the street.

38:46.282 --> 38:48.743
I mean, she might have
just gone to her hairdresser.

38:48.743 --> 38:51.412
I mean, she's, she's
about to crack, Jan.

38:51.412 --> 38:53.373
And I, and I, and I might join
her, and then you're gonna

38:53.373 --> 38:54.832
have that to deal with too.

38:54.832 --> 38:56.668
And still you bring
home more people.

38:56.668 --> 38:58.086
I mean, at some point,
we're no longer saving them.

38:58.086 --> 39:00.171
We're just putting
them in more danger.

39:00.171 --> 39:01.673
There has to be a line.

39:01.673 --> 39:04.926
JAN: The Nazis are taking more
and more people every day,

39:04.926 --> 39:07.762
so we have to save
more and more.

39:07.762 --> 39:09.138
Okay.

39:09.138 --> 39:10.723
Maybe we can't stop
and celebrate but

we can't stop altogether.

four more Jews out of a city

44:07.728 --> 44:10.189
MIEP: Sometimes you just need
to take a minute to celebrate.

44:10.189 --> 44:12.775
So we're going to make jam.

44:12.775 --> 44:13.943
I've closed early.

44:13.943 --> 44:15.653
I've locked up
tight downstairs.

44:15.653 --> 44:18.406
I got a couple dozen hands
and a master jam-maker.

44:18.406 --> 44:19.323
OTTO: Who is this?

44:19.323 --> 44:21.492
MIEP: Me!

44:22.076 --> 44:23.077
PETER: World's best straw...

44:23.077 --> 44:24.495
(laughing)

44:24.495 --> 44:25.746
MARGOT: Wait.
Actually, try it.

44:25.746 --> 44:27.582
Try it. Okay. Okay.

44:28.708 --> 44:30.710
PETER: Oh!

44:30.710 --> 44:32.753
HERMANN: I think
they'll advance to the north.

44:32.753 --> 44:33.921
FRITZ: I disagree.

44:33.921 --> 44:35.256
OTTO: What do you think, Miep?

44:35.256 --> 44:39.427
MIEP: Uh, I think that
you're a strawberry thief.

44:39.427 --> 44:41.387
(laughing)

44:41.387 --> 44:42.430
OTTO: Yes.

44:42.430 --> 44:44.891
(speaking German)

44:45.349 --> 44:46.976
AUGUSTE: No, I don't think
we need all of it.

44:46.976 --> 44:48.603
MIEP: Uh, who's the
jam-making expert here?

44:48.603 --> 44:50.146
You or me?

44:50.146 --> 44:52.190
AUGUSTE: Miep's getting sassy.

44:52.190 --> 44:54.775
EDITH: No.
Miep's perfect.

44:54.775 --> 44:56.986
(smooch)

44:56.986 --> 44:58.654
PETER: I think I'm
gonna move to Palestine.

44:58.654 --> 45:00.114
Work on a kibbutz.

45:00.114 --> 45:01.157
HERMANN: What? No.
It's, no, no, no.

45:01.157 --> 45:02.366
It's too far.

45:02.366 --> 45:03.784
PETER: Too far?
MARGOT: I'll be there too.

45:03.784 --> 45:07.830
I, I want to be a midwife,
help babies be born.

45:08.873 --> 45:10.875
What about you, Mama?

45:10.875 --> 45:11.959
What are you gonna
do after the war?

45:11.959 --> 45:13.252
ANNE: Yeah.
What you wanna do?

45:13.252 --> 45:14.629
EDITH: I haven't
given it much thought.

45:14.629 --> 45:15.796
I don't know.

45:15.796 --> 45:19.050
Perhaps, um, feel
the sun on our faces

45:19.050 --> 45:22.094
with each other, outside.

45:22.094 --> 45:23.554
Yeah.

45:23.554 --> 45:26.599
FRITZ: Well, we all know
Anne is going to be a writer.

45:26.599 --> 45:30.269
Perhaps one day she will
end up in Hollywood

45:30.269 --> 45:32.021
like those people on her wall.

45:32.021 --> 45:33.397
EDITH: Ooh.

45:33.397 --> 45:34.523
AUGUSTE: If you're gonna
publish that diary, Anne,

45:34.523 --> 45:36.108
I want to read it first.

45:36.108 --> 45:37.693
ANNE: There is no chance.

45:37.693 --> 45:39.236
AUGUSTE: Just my parts.

45:39.236 --> 45:42.990
Do you tell about the time I
got my hair stuck in the sink?

45:42.990 --> 45:44.867
(laughing)

45:44.867 --> 45:47.161
ANNE: I've told you all, you
can read it when it's ready

45:47.161 --> 45:49.914
and not before.

45:51.332 --> 45:54.627
OTTO: Thank you for this.

45:54.627 --> 45:57.463
MIEP: You can thank
Gerrit the potato man.

45:57.463 --> 46:00.341
OTTO: Reminds me,
when we first met,

46:00.341 --> 46:03.135
you spent days trying
to perfect that jam,

46:03.135 --> 46:06.264
learning all the pitfalls
and the tricks.

46:06.264 --> 46:08.140
Never gave up.

46:08.140 --> 46:10.810
MIEP: I wanted the job,
so I did what you said.

46:10.810 --> 46:12.687
OTTO: And you hated
every second of it.

46:12.687 --> 46:14.647
"Mr. Frank,
I'm not a housewife

46:14.647 --> 46:16.732
and I don't ever
want to be one."

46:16.732 --> 46:17.900
(laughing)

46:17.900 --> 46:20.653
MIEP: Why didn't
you just fire me?

46:24.740 --> 46:27.785
OTTO: Can you imagine
where we'd be if I had?

46:29.870 --> 46:32.123
MARGOT: Papa!
OTTO: Yeah.

46:32.123 --> 46:34.333
MARGOT: What are you
going to do after the war?

46:34.333 --> 46:37.920
OTTO: Same as I'm doing now,
reading Dickens and listening

46:37.920 --> 46:41.173
to all of the wonderful
noise my family makes.

46:41.173 --> 46:45.177
But I'll be eating
chocolate and drinking real,

46:45.177 --> 46:47.763
honest-to-goodness coffee.

46:47.763 --> 46:49.640
EDITH: And we won't have
to share that God-awful

46:49.640 --> 46:51.308
smelly bathroom.

46:51.308 --> 46:53.894
(laughing)

46:53.894 --> 46:55.062
AUGUSTE: Hear, hear.

46:55.062 --> 46:57.231
HERMANN: Oh, boy.

46:59.275 --> 47:02.611
MIEP: What?
JAN: What?

47:04.155 --> 47:07.408
Everything feels different
to me, the whole city,

47:07.408 --> 47:11.620
the people, the air, just
knowing the Allies are coming.

47:13.039 --> 47:16.292
MIEP: Nothing's changed.
Look around.

47:16.292 --> 47:20.796
There was a dead man floating
in that canal a few weeks ago.

47:21.714 --> 47:24.759
JAN: You're right.

47:24.759 --> 47:27.511
Lately, I've just been feeling
there's no way things could

47:27.511 --> 47:29.221
possibly return to normal.

47:29.221 --> 47:32.767
But today, I can see it.

47:32.767 --> 47:34.852
Do you feel that?

47:34.852 --> 47:39.231
MIEP: I want to,
but I still have to

47:39.231 --> 47:41.734
get the shopping
list every morning,

47:41.734 --> 47:44.612
and get Dr. Pfeffer
his letters from Lotte,

47:44.612 --> 47:47.656
and tell Anne everything
I've done in the entire day,

47:47.656 --> 47:49.992
and stop Mrs. Van Pels
and Mrs. Frank from

47:49.992 --> 47:50.826
killing each other.

47:50.826 --> 47:53.162
(whistling)

47:53.162 --> 47:56.791
Doesn't help me to
think of it that way.

47:56.791 --> 47:59.418
I have to keep doing
what I'm doing until

47:59.418 --> 48:02.254
the second they're free.

48:03.422 --> 48:06.801
Then, then things
will feel different.

48:09.095 --> 48:10.638
(laughing)

48:10.638 --> 48:12.848
BEP: You're terrible.

48:12.848 --> 48:15.309
MIEP: Coffee's ready
if anybody wants it.

48:15.309 --> 48:17.478
What's funny?

48:17.478 --> 48:19.688
JOHANNES: Kugler.

48:19.688 --> 48:21.732
MIEP: Kugler? What?

48:21.732 --> 48:23.400
There are about a dozen
words I'd use to describe

48:23.400 --> 48:25.486
him before funny.

48:25.486 --> 48:28.364
(laughing)

48:28.364 --> 48:31.826
Oh, what are you
doing down there?

48:31.826 --> 48:33.369
God, we're gonna be
finding these beans

48:33.369 --> 48:35.412
until the war's over.

48:36.664 --> 48:38.999
(gun cocks)

48:39.542 --> 48:42.294
GERMAN SOLDIER: Don't move.

48:42.294 --> 48:45.172
Just stay put.
