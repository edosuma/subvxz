- Hey, Frank,

00:34.511 --> 00:35.727
how's Wolf Cola doing?

00:35.846 --> 00:36.895
Funny you should ask.

I'm telling you, they're addicted.

00:43.687 --> 00:45.187

Wolf Cola used to just be, like,

00:45.322 --> 00:46.822

Well, it was,

We're just here to apologize, bozo.

06:58.526 --> 07:00.109
No, hold on a second, Dee, no.
We're not here

07:00.195 --> 07:02.228
to apologize, either, okay?
You never apologize.

07:02.313 --> 07:03.696
We're just here to take responsibility,

07:03.815 --> 07:04.981
but for nothing specific.

07:05.116 --> 07:06.699
All that matters is that consumers feel

07:06.818 --> 07:08.368
- their voices are being heard.
- No.

07:08.486 --> 07:10.486
You say you're sorry,
and then you just move on.

07:10.622 --> 07:12.071
No, Dee, actually,
<i>you</i> don't say anything.

07:12.157 --> 07:13.990
But you do have a very important job...

07:14.125 --> 07:15.908
to say nothing and stand behind me.

07:15.994 --> 07:17.460
You see, audiences are gonna trust me

07:17.545 --> 07:19.495
over you because you're a woman,

07:19.631 --> 07:22.048
and, by definition, shrill.

07:22.167 --> 07:24.417
No. Women identify with women in power.

07:24.502 --> 07:26.919
Oh, no, Dee.
Women hate other women in power.

07:27.005 --> 07:28.337
- I'm threatened by 'em.
- Everyone is.

07:28.473 --> 07:31.224
Now, objectify yourself and humanize me.

07:31.342 --> 07:33.059
Hmm.

07:33.178 --> 07:36.179
(theme music plays)

07:36.314 --> 07:38.398
And here to tell their side of the story

07:38.516 --> 07:40.483
is the team from Wolf Cola.

07:40.568 --> 07:41.601
Guys, thanks for coming in.

07:41.686 --> 07:43.236
Oh, well, thank you for having us, Chet.

07:43.354 --> 07:45.738
We at Wolf Cola were
as shocked and saddened

07:45.857 --> 07:47.824
by this news as everyone else.

07:47.909 --> 07:49.909
Uh, this by no means reflects our ideals

07:50.028 --> 07:51.778
as a premium soda company.

07:51.863 --> 07:53.362
We're a family-run business,

07:53.498 --> 07:55.164
and we really care
about people's concerns.

07:55.250 --> 07:56.282
Listen, the point is,

07:56.367 --> 07:58.000
we have heard you all,

07:58.086 --> 08:01.204
and we are working tirelessly
to remedy this situation.

08:01.339 --> 08:02.422
CHET: Well, not an easy situation,

08:02.540 --> 08:04.373
indeed, but handled
with grace and aplomb.

08:04.509 --> 08:06.092
Thank you, Mr. Reynolds.
And it looks like

08:06.211 --> 08:07.844
you're already getting good feedback.

08:07.929 --> 08:09.429
Oh, that's-that's great.
Well, uh, thank you, Chet.

08:09.547 --> 08:11.264
And I want to say
thank you to America...

08:11.382 --> 08:13.132
And also, we're sorry.

08:13.218 --> 08:14.801
We accept full responsibility

08:14.886 --> 08:17.103
for this heinous mistake,
and please know

08:17.222 --> 08:19.972
that I am actively firing
people as we speak,

08:20.058 --> 08:22.608
because <i> I</i> am the boss.

08:22.727 --> 08:24.227
(whispers): Bitch.

08:24.362 --> 08:26.145
That's good to know.

08:26.231 --> 08:26.979
Yes.

08:27.065 --> 08:28.281
Next up, a heroic tale...

08:28.399 --> 08:29.615
FRANK: You know what, Chet,

08:29.734 --> 08:30.700
can I say something?

08:30.785 --> 08:31.784
I think we've said enough.

08:31.903 --> 08:33.034
I think... you got to understand

08:33.121 --> 08:35.121
that Boko Haram did not do 9/11.

08:35.240 --> 08:36.956
- Yeah.
- That was... al-Qaeda.

08:37.075 --> 08:38.241
Paris, that was done

08:38.376 --> 08:39.325
by ISIS.

08:39.409 --> 08:41.126
Boko Haram is just concentrating,

08:41.246 --> 08:42.879
they're doing Africa. I mean...

08:42.964 --> 08:44.380
- (groans)
- I mean, there's mosquitos down there

08:44.466 --> 08:48.084
that are bigger terrorists
than Boko Haram.

08:50.722 --> 08:53.055
- (theme music plays)
- We're gonna take a break.

08:59.175 --> 09:01.700
And the 24-hour news cycle starts again.

09:01.819 --> 09:03.151
Way to go, assholes.

09:03.287 --> 09:04.570
- I made good points.
- Jesus Christ,

09:04.655 --> 09:06.455
I am just getting eviscerated online.

09:06.540 --> 09:08.874
People calling me a bitch,
flat-chested bitch,

09:08.993 --> 09:11.076
pretty much everybody
wanting to rape me.

09:11.195 --> 09:12.911
You opened that door the
second you apologized, Dee.

09:12.997 --> 09:14.796
You don't see this?
People need an outlet

09:14.882 --> 09:16.548
to unleash their rage. Now social media

09:16.667 --> 09:18.133
will come down on you

09:18.218 --> 09:19.835
with the fury of a middle-aged man

09:19.970 --> 09:21.336
who's accomplished nothing.

09:21.472 --> 09:23.255
- Hi-yo!
- What's up, bitches?

09:23.340 --> 09:24.673
What's that? What do you got?

09:24.808 --> 09:26.675
Huh? Crow traps, baby. Look.

09:26.810 --> 09:28.060
Fight Milk is boomin'. Apparently,

09:28.178 --> 09:30.095
people are using it to lose weight.

09:30.180 --> 09:32.731
Yeah. Now, we're gonna lean
into that new market

09:32.850 --> 09:34.483
- and rebrand the product.
- Mm-hmm.

09:34.568 --> 09:36.234
I like this rebranding idea.

09:36.353 --> 09:39.021
That's what I got to do...
I got to rebrand my product.

09:39.156 --> 09:42.107
You guys, the problem is,
I just ooze sexuality.

09:42.192 --> 09:43.075
Well, you ooze.

09:43.193 --> 09:44.359
A real woman of power,

09:44.495 --> 09:46.612
she exudes no sexuality at all.

09:46.697 --> 09:47.412
That's true.

09:47.413 --> 09:49.963
I think we got to focus
on not losing Boko Haram.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.250
That's a good business.
The fastest-growing marketplace

09:52.369 --> 09:54.286
is Muslim extremists.

09:54.371 --> 09:56.171
Frank, we're not going into
business with terrorists.

09:56.256 --> 09:57.539
Are you crazy?

09:57.675 --> 10:00.008
Look, we need
to get back on TV immediately

10:00.094 --> 10:01.760
and control the goddamn narrative.

10:01.879 --> 10:03.845
Yeah, speaking of TV, we're
gonna be doing a little controlling

10:03.931 --> 10:05.847
of our narrative,
so you guys mind clearing out?

10:05.933 --> 10:07.633
Yeah, this is now our set.

10:07.718 --> 10:08.967
All right, come on,
we got work to do, guys. Let's go.

10:09.053 --> 10:10.352
Let's go. Don't forget your phone,

10:10.437 --> 10:11.520
- stupid idiot.
- Yep.

10:11.605 --> 10:13.105
(hard rock playing)

10:13.223 --> 10:15.273
- (caws)
- (caws)

10:15.392 --> 10:17.142
- Three, two, one! What up!
- What up!

10:17.227 --> 10:20.395
- Are you fat?
- You probably are, 'cause you're watching TV!

10:20.531 --> 10:21.897
Or Internet.

10:22.032 --> 10:23.598
- ♪
♪
- (cawing)

10:23.701 --> 10:25.367
Fight Milk! Rebrand!

10:25.452 --> 10:26.652

10:26.737 --> 10:28.437
- ♪
♪
- (cawing)

10:28.539 --> 10:30.956
Let's talk about <i> women's</i> bodies.

10:31.075 --> 10:32.240
I <i> like</i> women.

10:32.376 --> 10:33.792
It's easy for us men... we have four

10:33.911 --> 10:35.243
acceptable body types.

10:35.379 --> 10:37.779
<i>Skinny ripped, jack ripped, dad bod,</i>

10:37.881 --> 10:39.548
and fat... if you're funny.

10:39.633 --> 10:41.550
It's a landslide!

10:41.635 --> 10:45.387
As we all know, women only have
one acceptable body type.

10:45.472 --> 10:47.155
<i>Skinny, big tits!</i>

10:47.257 --> 10:49.174
<i>New evidence is suggesting
that all this science</i>

10:49.259 --> 10:50.642
<i>inside one crow's egg</i>

10:50.761 --> 10:53.729
can scientifically make
your breasts larger.

10:53.814 --> 10:56.598
Watch the enzymes
enlargify your breasts.

10:56.734 --> 10:58.016
(whooshing)

10:58.102 --> 10:59.768
Want to hear more about it? The sci...

10:59.903 --> 11:00.902
- (cawing)
- Aah!

11:00.988 --> 11:03.271
No nerds! Fight Milk!

11:03.407 --> 11:04.272
(cawing)

11:04.408 --> 11:05.357
Finally there's a crow-based

11:05.442 --> 11:07.242
protein alcoholic drink for <i> you.</i>

11:07.327 --> 11:08.944
BOTH: Fight Milk! Fight Milk!

11:09.079 --> 11:10.445
(cawing)

11:11.832 --> 11:14.616
- Well, what do you guys think?
- I don't get it.

11:14.752 --> 11:16.034
That's 'cause you're a stupid ring girl.

11:16.120 --> 11:17.369
- It couldn't be any simpler.
- Yeah, look,

11:17.454 --> 11:19.171
take it easy. Basically, we're trying

11:19.289 --> 11:21.339
to expand our product to
the world of UFC women,

11:21.458 --> 11:23.675
and look, uh,
ring girls are the perfect combo.

11:23.794 --> 11:25.210
- Really.
- Yeah. I mean, honestly, ladies,

11:25.295 --> 11:27.045
you could afford to lose a <i> few</i> pounds,

11:27.131 --> 11:28.213
maybe in this area...

11:28.298 --> 11:30.549
- Well...
- or here.

11:30.634 --> 11:33.101
Really, I mean, between the three
of you, we could be opening up

11:33.187 --> 11:34.853
a bakery with all the
muffin tops I'm seeing.

11:34.972 --> 11:36.304
- Yes.
- Now, Fight Milk will help you

11:36.440 --> 11:37.806
lose those unwanted pounds

11:37.941 --> 11:39.641
so you don't have to resort to surgery,

11:39.777 --> 11:41.727
which could cause scarring and
make you even less attractive

11:41.812 --> 11:43.812
- to men than you already are, okay?
- All right.

11:43.947 --> 11:45.147
- Now, I feel like...
- No, no, look, I'm sorry,

11:45.282 --> 11:46.865
my friend has really weird women issues.

11:46.984 --> 11:48.617
I didn't realize he
brought a laser pointer.

11:48.702 --> 11:51.153
But the point is,
you guys could look even better

11:51.288 --> 11:52.621
if you drank Fight Milk.

11:52.706 --> 11:55.490
We're not into your
weird diarrhea drink.

11:55.626 --> 11:57.209
Right. Okay, it's not a diarrhea drink.

11:57.327 --> 11:58.794
- It's...
- You know what, Charlie?

11:58.879 --> 12:00.378
This isn't the dream that
I had for Fight Milk.

12:00.497 --> 12:02.380
No! We're not the diarrhea guys.

12:02.499 --> 12:04.216
- No!
- That's not what I want to be.

12:04.334 --> 12:06.384
It's not for women!
It was never made for women!

12:06.503 --> 12:08.587
But it'd be great if
women also drank it.

12:08.672 --> 12:10.639
The dream was to create
a muscle-up energy drink

12:10.724 --> 12:13.225
- Yeah.
- that gave you the power to fight like a crow!

12:13.343 --> 12:14.726
- Yes!
- Men!

12:14.845 --> 12:16.394
Or women. But yes. But definitely

12:16.513 --> 12:18.346
- crow-power fighting skills.
- Either way,

12:18.482 --> 12:21.266
- Absolutely.
- I think, dude, we got to get back to the lab.

12:21.351 --> 12:23.568
I think we got to get some more crows.

12:23.687 --> 12:26.905
(theme music plays)

12:27.024 --> 12:29.858
From dog fighting to
finding a loving home.

12:29.993 --> 12:31.693
(chuckles): Amazing.

12:31.829 --> 12:34.412
Now, who wouldn't want to
adopt a little guy like this?

12:34.531 --> 12:36.331
(chuckling): Well said, Mike.

12:36.416 --> 12:38.950
Great story.

12:39.036 --> 12:42.454
Now a local soda company
is back in hot water

12:42.539 --> 12:44.790
with controversial remarks.

12:44.875 --> 12:48.376
Returning to talk about it today
is the team from Wolf Cola.

12:48.512 --> 12:51.463
Thank you so much for having us back,
Chet. Um,

12:51.548 --> 12:54.182
we at Wolf Cola are not just
about making a satisfying soda.

12:54.268 --> 12:56.768
We are about making satisfied customers.

12:56.887 --> 12:58.520
We do acknowledge consumers' concerns.

12:58.605 --> 13:00.939
Yes, but we are not apologizing.

13:01.058 --> 13:02.274
(mutters)

13:02.392 --> 13:04.309
- Right. Oh.
- Sorry.

13:04.394 --> 13:06.311
I'm just here to humanize him.

13:06.396 --> 13:07.729
- To support me.
- To-to support him.

13:07.865 --> 13:09.147
Support me.

13:09.233 --> 13:10.649
(clears his throat)

13:10.734 --> 13:12.317
Uh, Chet, we would also like to announce

13:12.402 --> 13:14.202
that for every can of Wolf Cola sold,

13:14.288 --> 13:16.872
a portion of the proceeds
will be going to a charity

13:16.957 --> 13:18.490
that supports African people.

13:18.575 --> 13:19.958
FRANK: All Africans,

13:20.077 --> 13:21.993
even the... our friends at Boko Haram,

13:22.079 --> 13:24.129
because they are people, too.

13:24.248 --> 13:26.214
- We don't discriminate.
- Okay, right.

13:26.300 --> 13:27.749
Uh, yeah, look, Chet, if I may

13:27.885 --> 13:29.084
address the public directly?

13:29.219 --> 13:30.335
- By all means.
- Okay.

13:30.420 --> 13:31.753
Um, I assure you

13:31.889 --> 13:33.338
that we have righted this ship,

13:33.423 --> 13:35.390
and we are taking every step necessary

13:35.475 --> 13:37.175
to address all of your concerns.

13:37.261 --> 13:39.311
We at Wolf Cola hope to be a part

13:39.429 --> 13:41.646
of your family's daily
refreshment for years to come.

13:42.403 --> 13:45.759
And we can say that
without saying I'm sorry.

13:46.378 --> 13:46.902
CHET: Well, Mr. Reynolds,

13:46.987 --> 13:49.187
it sounds like Wolf Cola
has the right man in charge.

13:49.273 --> 13:51.022
- (sniffing, grunts)
- Yeah. Well, I appreciate that.

13:51.108 --> 13:52.824
- (laughing): Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Whoa.

13:52.943 --> 13:54.359
I thought we were done
with the dog segment.

13:54.444 --> 13:56.027
- What the hell's this?
- Oh. Looks like we got

13:56.113 --> 13:57.779
a lovable little guy
loose in the studio here.

13:57.915 --> 13:59.331
Yeah. Can we get him out of here?

13:59.449 --> 14:00.749
- Great. Thanks.
- Not a dog

14:00.834 --> 14:02.033
- lover, Mr. Reynolds?
- Yeah.

14:02.119 --> 14:03.501
Well, if you're asking me

14:03.620 --> 14:05.203
if I like wild animals
slobbering all over me,

14:05.289 --> 14:06.671
then, yeah, I guess I'm not really a...

14:06.790 --> 14:08.340
- not really a dog lover then.
- Wow. I have

14:08.458 --> 14:10.342
never met a person who
does not like dogs before.

14:10.460 --> 14:11.843
- (laughing): Yeah. Yeah.
- (laughs)

14:11.962 --> 14:13.628
There are plenty of us out there,

14:13.764 --> 14:16.047
uh, Chet. Okay, trust me.
We're just afraid to admit it

14:16.133 --> 14:18.683
because we feel like we're gonna
be judged by people like you.

14:18.802 --> 14:21.219
- Well, let's take a break.
- You know what? Actually, I'm not done.

14:21.305 --> 14:24.139
- Uh, Chet, are you a vegetarian by any chance?
- No.

14:24.274 --> 14:25.557
Oh, so you're a hypocrite. Yeah.

14:25.642 --> 14:27.025
See, I find that
most people that are whining

14:27.144 --> 14:28.894
about dog fights are
actually the same people

14:28.979 --> 14:30.645
going to football games and UFC fights,

14:30.781 --> 14:32.697
watching human beings
beat the ever-loving shit

14:32.816 --> 14:34.733
out of each other while eating,
uh, fried chicken.

14:34.818 --> 14:37.402
So, wait. Are you saying you're
an animal rights activist?

14:37.487 --> 14:39.204
No, I'm actually the opposite, pal.

14:39.323 --> 14:41.373
I can't imagine a bigger waste
of peoples' time and energy.

14:41.491 --> 14:42.874
I mean, Chet,
if you can eat fried chicken, then

14:42.993 --> 14:44.492
I should be able to
eat me some fried dog.

14:44.628 --> 14:46.211
Know what I'm saying?
I should be able to eat a bucket

14:46.330 --> 14:48.079
of fried dog at a chicken fight.
(laughs)

14:48.165 --> 14:49.547
Yeah. All I'm saying is,

14:49.666 --> 14:52.968
look, let's just, you know,
let's be consistent.

15:03.855 --> 15:05.155
(cawing)

15:05.240 --> 15:06.823
(laughing)

15:06.908 --> 15:08.324
MAC: How you feeling, boys?
You've been pounding

15:08.410 --> 15:10.276
- that new formula?
- Yeah, I see you doing it.

15:10.362 --> 15:11.661
Yeah, and we're not doing so good,
asshole,

15:11.746 --> 15:13.079
'cause nothing's coming out of me.

15:13.198 --> 15:15.365
My trash can's empty.

15:15.500 --> 15:16.665
Yeah, we're scared to shit
we ain't gonna make weight.

15:16.666 --> 15:17.366
- MAC: Oh, guys.
- Guys, just don't worry.

15:17.536 --> 15:18.952
- Yeah, yeah, don't worry.
- No, guys, guys, guys.

15:19.037 --> 15:20.370
Don't worry.
Okay, look, this is all a part

15:20.505 --> 15:21.921
of our two-step process, all right?

15:22.040 --> 15:23.289
See, right now, you're crow loading...

15:23.375 --> 15:24.674
Yeah, you drank about, like,

15:24.759 --> 15:26.292
four or five entire crows

15:26.378 --> 15:28.128
'cause I'm grinding one up for
every bottle at this point.

15:28.213 --> 15:30.096
Yes, and it is that crow
enzyme that's jacking you up,

15:30.215 --> 15:32.550
and that's why you look
so beefy and so handsome.

15:32.550 --> 15:34.717
And... All right, but then what's
gonna happen is, you start drinking

15:34.853 --> 15:36.186
the Fight Milk Classic, right,

15:36.271 --> 15:37.770
and-and that's gonna
make you really sick,

15:37.889 --> 15:39.189
'cause that's just the crow eggs

15:39.274 --> 15:40.607
and some of the crow's fecal matter.

15:40.725 --> 15:42.025
So you start to puke everything out,

15:42.110 --> 15:43.560
and then you'll be
fine for the weigh-in.

15:43.695 --> 15:45.395
You're gonna be puking
on your dick in no time.

15:45.530 --> 15:47.113
Yeah, yeah, that one's real nasty.
Don't worry about it.

15:47.232 --> 15:48.531
- Yeah.
- You're gonna make weight at the weigh-in.

15:48.617 --> 15:50.150
Yeah, all I know is,
we don't make weight,

15:50.235 --> 15:51.701
I'm killing you both.

15:52.904 --> 15:54.704
Yeah.

15:54.789 --> 15:55.989
- All right.
- MAC: Uh, that's fine.

15:56.074 --> 15:57.740
We're gonna be... We're good.

15:57.876 --> 15:59.242
- Yeah. Yeah.
- All right, guys, hey, go... go kick ass.

15:59.377 --> 16:01.995
Remember, that's the nasty one.
Drink that one.

16:02.080 --> 16:03.796
That one's got a real...

16:03.915 --> 16:05.165
♪ ♪

16:05.250 --> 16:06.883
All right,

16:06.968 --> 16:09.469
let's bring out the first fighter,
Cub Swanson.

16:09.588 --> 16:13.723
(applause and cheering)

16:13.808 --> 16:15.892
- We got to get him on Fight Milk, man.
- Oh, yeah, we got to get him.

16:15.977 --> 16:17.594
We got to get him.
We got to get him drinking it.

16:17.729 --> 16:21.564
Up next, the challenger,
Donald "Cowboy" Cerrone.

16:21.650 --> 16:23.066
(applause and cheering,
energetic music playing)

16:23.151 --> 16:24.517
- Come on!
- (cheering)

16:24.603 --> 16:26.986
- Yes!
- (whooping)

16:30.942 --> 16:32.692
This is it. If he makes weight,

16:32.777 --> 16:35.028
this is gonna change Fight
Milk and our lives forever.

16:35.113 --> 16:36.863
I know, but if he doesn't,
we're bolting, right?

16:36.948 --> 16:38.698
Oh, yeah. I've already
scoped out every single exit.

16:38.783 --> 16:40.116
- (crowd chanting)
- 155.

16:40.252 --> 16:41.367
(applause and cheering)

16:41.453 --> 16:42.702
Yes!

16:42.787 --> 16:44.287
MAC: Yeah. We did it!

16:44.422 --> 16:45.705
- We're gonna be rich!
- We did it! We're gonna be rich!

16:45.790 --> 16:47.423
- We're gonna be rich.
- Let's go.

16:47.509 --> 16:49.125
All right, Cowboy,
how you feeling right now?

16:49.261 --> 16:51.544
I'm feeling good. Ready to put
on a show for all these guys.

16:51.630 --> 16:53.179
(Mac and Charlie cawing)

16:53.298 --> 16:56.132
What the hell is going on?
Who are these guys?

16:56.268 --> 16:58.384
Uh, just like to take the
opportunity to thank Fight Milk.

16:58.470 --> 17:01.437
Yes, and thank you, Cowboy,
and thank you, Megan.

17:01.523 --> 17:02.889
We'd also like to take this opportunity

17:02.974 --> 17:04.390
to announce that Fight Milk is now

17:04.476 --> 17:06.142
- the official drink of the UFC.
- Official drink.

17:06.278 --> 17:07.560
Now if you're in...

17:07.646 --> 17:09.028
- (microphone feedback)
- No, no.

17:09.146 --> 17:10.780
This is not the official
drink of the UFC.

17:10.865 --> 17:12.565
And I don't know who these guys are.

17:12.651 --> 17:15.401
- Security, get these assholes out of here!
- Fight Milk!

17:15.487 --> 17:16.868
BOTH: Fight Milk! Fight Milk!

17:16.988 --> 17:19.656
AUDIENCE: Fight Milk!
Fight Milk! Fight Milk!

17:19.790 --> 17:21.540
Fight Milk! Fight Milk!

17:22.539 --> 17:24.501
MAN (on TV):
The nationwide hatred for Wolf Cola

17:24.636 --> 17:27.637
continues to intensify
on an hourly basis...

17:27.722 --> 17:30.507
Holy shit. We're getting hammered
worse than before.

17:30.642 --> 17:32.842
Bye-bye, Frank's Fluids.

17:32.978 --> 17:34.844
Turns out there are <i> two</i> things
that can't be forgiven...

17:34.980 --> 17:36.679
raping children and disliking dogs.

17:36.815 --> 17:39.599
CHARLIE: Well, what am I gonna
do with all the merchandise, man?

17:39.684 --> 17:41.684
Throw it in the garbage, burn it.
Who gives a shit.

17:41.820 --> 17:43.603
Yeah, we're done.
Fight Milk shit the bed.

17:43.688 --> 17:46.072
- What happened?
- CHET (on TV): Breaking news

17:46.191 --> 17:47.323
from the sports world.

17:47.409 --> 17:48.608
Fighters at a UFC

17:48.693 --> 17:51.027
event in Philly tested positive

17:51.163 --> 17:53.196
for several banned substances,

17:53.331 --> 17:56.533
stemming from an energy
drink called Fight Milk.

17:56.668 --> 17:58.300
We pumped it full of human
growth hormone, you know.

17:58.301 --> 17:58.901
Yeah.

17:58.920 --> 18:00.537
I mean, just nothing else was working.

18:00.672 --> 18:02.338
It just... it was just
giving people diarrhea.

18:02.424 --> 18:03.506
- Mm.
- Ugh.

18:03.592 --> 18:04.924
Starting to become known

18:05.043 --> 18:06.759
as the official drink of the UFC,

18:06.878 --> 18:09.546
this Fight Milk is a serious
smudge for the group,

18:09.681 --> 18:13.183
and a potential public
relations nightmare.

18:13.268 --> 18:14.801
- Ooh.
- Holy shit. Holy shit.

18:14.886 --> 18:16.386
- What?
- You guys, this is good.

18:16.521 --> 18:18.138
This is good.
We're freed, and they are screwed.

18:18.223 --> 18:19.689
See, this is actually the one <i> good</i> thing

18:19.774 --> 18:21.474
about the 24-hour news cycle.

18:21.560 --> 18:23.860
If you give it enough time,
something new will come along

18:23.945 --> 18:26.529
to replace peoples'
old outrage with new outrage.

18:26.615 --> 18:28.148
Not much is known about Fight Milk,

18:28.233 --> 18:30.533
except that it's made
right here in Philadelphia

18:30.619 --> 18:33.369
by a parent company
known as Frank's Fluids.

18:33.455 --> 18:35.955
<i>Goddamn</i> it!

18:36.074 --> 18:37.490
(sighs)

18:37.576 --> 18:39.125
Start the clock.

18:39.244 --> 18:40.460
Yeah.
