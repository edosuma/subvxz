Kono.

33:28.154 --> 33:29.154
What happened?

33:29.155 --> 33:32.154
Your mother had an aneurysm.

33:37.155 --> 33:39.154
Is she gonna be all right?

34:08.154 --> 34:10.154
(sniffles)

34:35.154 --> 34:37.862
Sir, we're observing
storm-force winds.

34:37.864 --> 34:39.152
45 to 50 knots,

34:39.154 --> 34:40.154
gusting to 60.

34:40.155 --> 34:42.321
Swells at 30 feet and building.

34:42.322 --> 34:45.152
Reported lightning strikes
in the vicinity of the airfield.

34:45.154 --> 34:48.152
Kono's outrigger doesn't stand
a chance in those conditions.

34:48.154 --> 34:50.152
Launch the alert cutter,
station Honolulu.

34:50.154 --> 34:52.321
Notify the B-6 unit to get
underway as soon as possible.

34:52.322 --> 34:54.152
Yes, sir.

34:54.154 --> 34:56.152
We'll have four boats
in the water within a half hour.

34:56.154 --> 34:57.321
Okay, that's four boats.

34:57.322 --> 34:59.153
What are you doing
about air support?

34:59.154 --> 35:01.153
(sighs) I understand
your frustration, Lieutenant,

35:01.154 --> 35:05.153
but we cannot utilize aircraft
in these conditions.

35:05.154 --> 35:07.655
Captain, all due respect,

35:07.656 --> 35:09.488
that's our friend out there
floating around

35:09.489 --> 35:11.153

of driftwood.

35:11.154 --> 35:12.154
I'm well aware of that.

35:12.155 --> 35:15.030
And when the front passes,
we'll have a window

35:15.031 --> 35:17.153
to launch our SAR Birds.

35:17.154 --> 35:19.153
Until then, it's
a surface search only.

35:19.154 --> 35:20.154
STEVE:
Sir.

35:22.154 --> 35:26.030
If the safety of your men is
your main concern, let me fly.

35:26.031 --> 35:28.030
I have experience
piloting HH-65s

35:28.031 --> 35:29.321
in conditions worse than
this many times over.

35:29.322 --> 35:32.153

and you know it.

35:32.154 --> 35:34.153

So, what?

35:34.154 --> 35:35.594
