24:58.663 --> 25:01.333
to tutor my son,
who then slept with him?

25:01.416 --> 25:04.294
I mean, I'm rich enough
to be a Democrat,

25:04.377 --> 25:05.921
but you think
that sits well with me?

25:08.298 --> 25:10.091
I'm really sorry.

25:10.175 --> 25:11.927
It crept up on both of us.
It was--

25:12.010 --> 25:13.386
it was very unprofessional.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.479
Sadly, my own looks
have declined to the point

25:22.562 --> 25:24.272
where only women
will sleep with me.

25:29.152 --> 25:32.239
So, he's been drifting
long enough.

25:32.322 --> 25:34.908

to New York or...

25:34.991 --> 25:36.076
I don't know...

25:37.953 --> 25:39.037
I'll cut him off.

Isn't that what people
with means

25:41.331 --> 25:43.500
are meant to do
with their unruly kids?

25:46.544 --> 25:48.255
Maybe he won't be
passionate about it,

25:48.338 --> 25:50.048
but it might surprise him.

-He didn't get in.
-(CHUCKLES) Yeah, but that--

26:40.598 --> 26:42.517
that doesn't reflect
on your tutelage.

26:44.769 --> 26:46.646
he tried, I could tell
he was disappointed,

26:46.730 --> 26:50.233
and I could tell
he wanted comfort, even from me.

26:50.317 --> 26:53.361
We've made some progress.
So, thank you.

37:44.345 --> 37:46.806
You know him, right?

37:46.889 --> 37:50.601
Oh, we're all friends.
We've been tryna convince him

37:50.685 --> 37:53.646
to stop out of a short
he's hemorrhaging money on.

37:53.729 --> 37:56.065
He calls
for our desk's council nonstop.

37:57.066 --> 37:58.943
We're a team here, you see.

38:00.403 --> 38:02.989
He's still running it?
He hasn't stopped out yet?

38:03.072 --> 38:06.617
Oh, you work here already,
do you? (CHUCKLES)

38:06.701 --> 38:08.536
Doug, I didn't know
we were adding

38:08.619 --> 38:10.705
to our
Senior Relationship Managers?

38:10.788 --> 38:12.790
Didn't they send you
upstairs, Eric?

38:12.873 --> 38:15.876
Gotta cut to the mustard. Uh.
Truth be told,

38:15.960 --> 38:19.880
you're kinda helping us
materially

38:19.964 --> 38:22.883
just by being in the room now.

38:22.967 --> 38:27.430
We've been in negotiations
with a competitor's CPS team

38:27.513 --> 38:30.725
for months.
Let's call them Shogun.

38:32.268 --> 38:33.978
Is that problematic? I hope not.

38:34.061 --> 38:37.231
They've been chasing us
on terms. Inviting you here,

38:37.315 --> 38:40.192
well, we kinda knew
they'd get wind of it.

38:41.485 --> 38:44.572
Hopefully, this will
spook them into signing.

38:44.655 --> 38:47.700
Daria's going to run
that team for us.

38:47.783 --> 38:50.453
Frankly, we're tickled pink
at the prospect.

38:52.663 --> 38:56.459
I'm sure another opportunity
to collaborate

38:56.542 --> 38:59.253
is just around the corner
for me and you.

39:01.338 --> 39:02.381
(CHUCKLES)

39:03.632 --> 39:04.925
What did-- what did I ever do

39:05.009 --> 39:06.802
for you to fuck me
like this, Doug?

39:08.679 --> 39:12.058
If the roles were reversed,
I'd applaud.

39:13.059 --> 39:14.101
So should you.

39:19.231 --> 39:22.610
Touché, you fucking prick.

39:22.693 --> 39:25.905
DARIA: Um, no need
for handbags, gentlemen.

39:25.988 --> 39:28.365
You know the rough and tumble
of this business.

39:29.658 --> 39:31.952
DOUGLAS: Anything else
you wanted from these three?

39:33.537 --> 39:34.538
No.

39:35.498 --> 39:36.665
Got everything I need.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.431
Didn't know you were a smoker.

39:52.515 --> 39:54.266
Yeah, I nicked them
from Harper's desk.

40:11.367 --> 40:12.409
I'm sorry...

40:13.911 --> 40:15.121
about whatever happened.

40:17.665 --> 40:20.417
I think I overreacted
bringing it up.

40:21.585 --> 40:23.337
I feel fucking stupid.

40:23.420 --> 40:27.591
And to be honest, I have no idea
how to feel about it now.

40:27.675 --> 40:30.010
ROBERT: Well,
I don't think you overreacted.

40:30.094 --> 40:32.096
I'm surprised they've let you
out of the room.

40:32.179 --> 40:34.849
VENETIA: Yeah.
They don't have the protocols

40:34.932 --> 40:36.308
in place to deal with it.

40:37.685 --> 40:39.353
Yeah.

40:39.436 --> 40:41.605
There's a bit
of a leadership vacuum, I think.

40:44.442 --> 40:45.484
I think you knew.

40:48.070 --> 40:50.531
-Excuse me?
-You heard me.

40:52.032 --> 40:53.951
You don't have
a normal relationship

40:54.034 --> 40:56.370
with that woman.
The way you spoke to each other.

40:56.453 --> 40:57.496
I cover her.

40:58.622 --> 41:00.457
That's a deeply
personal relationship

41:00.541 --> 41:01.584
when it's successful.

41:02.918 --> 41:04.712
-You're projecting.
-VENETIA: Bullshit.

41:04.795 --> 41:07.715
She spoke to you
like you were...

41:07.798 --> 41:11.719
-her toy, just a plaything.
-ROBERT: So did you.

41:15.014 --> 41:16.765
Look, I'm so sorry that...

41:19.727 --> 41:20.936
that that happened to you.

41:22.229 --> 41:23.230
VENETIA: It's okay.

41:24.273 --> 41:26.025
You weren't to know, right?

41:28.110 --> 41:29.278
I mean, it's not like
you sent me

41:29.361 --> 41:31.572
a concerned voice-note
or anything.

41:37.036 --> 41:38.829
KENNY: Let's run it up
the chain first,

41:38.913 --> 41:41.707
get a bit of a steer then we can
see if we need to involve HR.

41:41.790 --> 41:43.417
-DVD: I'll do it right now.
-KENNY: Grand.

41:43.500 --> 41:44.710
Great. Thanks.

41:44.793 --> 41:46.420
Where the fuck is Rishi
by the way?

41:47.546 --> 41:49.048
Uh. Dentist, he said.

41:49.131 --> 41:52.176
-Or hygienist.
-Again? What-- what has he got,

41:52.259 --> 41:53.427
a fucking abscess?

41:55.471 --> 41:57.431
-I need to talk to you.
-DVD: Look, man, can it wait?

41:57.514 --> 41:58.933
This day is just evaporating
before my eyes.

41:59.016 --> 42:01.602
-I'm meeting with Adler in five.
-No. I lied earlier.

42:02.186 --> 42:03.187
DVD: Once again.

42:04.063 --> 42:05.606
I lied about Nicole.

42:05.689 --> 42:07.733
We had a sexual relationship.

42:07.816 --> 42:11.403
Woah, man. That's very thorny.
You, uh, you sure?

42:11.487 --> 42:12.571
What do you mean, am I sure?

42:12.655 --> 42:14.281
No idea why I said that,
my brain is fucking fritzed.

42:14.365 --> 42:15.866
Are you a mad man?
Out of all the women?

42:15.950 --> 42:17.534
What do you mean,
"of all the women"?

42:17.618 --> 42:19.411
We-- we worked together,
it became intimate.
Is it really that strange?

42:19.495 --> 42:20.746
No. It's deeply naïve
and unprofessional.

42:20.829 --> 42:22.957
That behavior will
always blow back in your face.

42:23.040 --> 42:24.792
You know, that's the kinda shit
you have to disclose

42:24.875 --> 42:25.960
to the regulators, right?

42:26.043 --> 42:28.420
I'm-- I'm correctly assuming
it was consensual?

42:29.672 --> 42:30.881
-Correct.
-(EXHALES)

42:30.965 --> 42:32.383
I feel like it's an added
complication that doesn't help

42:32.466 --> 42:34.301
with this morning's events.
It-- it muddles the picture.

42:34.385 --> 42:35.678
Where-- where is
our fucking head trader?

42:35.761 --> 42:36.971
I have fifty clients
wanting prices.

42:37.054 --> 42:38.430
-I know it's a pattern
of behavior.
-What is?

42:38.514 --> 42:40.224
-Rishi's fucking dental work?
-No. Nicole.

42:44.061 --> 42:45.813
Now, I don't know the details,

42:45.896 --> 42:49.149
but I know something happened
to Harper when we first joined.

42:50.985 --> 42:53.320
Wait, you serious?
She told you that?

42:54.029 --> 42:55.197
All but. Yeah.

42:58.367 --> 43:00.286
Fuck. She been holding
that in the whole time?

43:04.206 --> 43:05.207
Jesus.

43:11.130 --> 43:14.008
ADLER: Why are you involving me
in something so low-level?

43:14.091 --> 43:16.260
This doesn't say much
for our duty of care

43:16.343 --> 43:18.637
if this shit's happening
to grads.

43:19.555 --> 43:20.848
Well if you wanna manage,

43:20.931 --> 43:23.892
then make management decisions.
Take a course of action.

43:23.976 --> 43:25.394
If you'd thought I was ready
for management,

43:25.477 --> 43:27.771
then you might've promoted me
as promised.

43:27.855 --> 43:29.690
(CHUCKLES) I'm sorry,

43:29.773 --> 43:31.692
is this about you
or about the new hire?

43:33.402 --> 43:36.989
Uh. I'm worried it's a pattern.

43:37.072 --> 43:39.950
The client did the same thing
to Harper Stern on our desk.

43:42.578 --> 43:45.372
(SIGHS) That kid prints
a tonne of biz.

43:47.541 --> 43:48.542
You close?

43:51.086 --> 43:52.296
No.

43:52.379 --> 43:54.048
I just suspended her

43:54.131 --> 43:56.216
for fucking up
one of our trader's books.

43:58.135 --> 44:00.054
Well, I still want
her business in New York,

44:00.137 --> 44:01.221
but I don't want her

44:01.305 --> 44:03.098
in another HR entanglement,
given her history.

44:03.182 --> 44:06.810
I-- I don't want more HR noise
anywhere on that floor.

44:08.896 --> 44:11.523
What I tend do
in these situations is,

44:11.607 --> 44:12.900
sit on them.

44:12.983 --> 44:14.651
You'd think they fester,
but in the aggregate,

44:14.735 --> 44:16.695
they just, you know,
they just go away.

44:18.906 --> 44:21.241
-So, you want me to bury it all?
-(ADLER SCOFFS)

44:23.118 --> 44:24.995
Let it bury itself.

44:26.121 --> 44:28.707
And Danny,
I've gotta put in face time

44:28.791 --> 44:31.585
with the new blood on RIF,
and fold London CPS

44:31.668 --> 44:33.629
with God knows
how many redundancies.

44:33.712 --> 44:35.464
I really don't have the minutes
in the day

44:35.547 --> 44:38.926
-for mosquitoes like this.
-All right. I'm sorry.

44:42.930 --> 44:44.556
TUTOR: Yeah, that's always
gratifying to see

44:44.640 --> 44:45.974
my former students do so well.

44:46.058 --> 44:47.768
And the politics faculty

44:47.851 --> 44:50.646
talk about Aurore
more than is healthy. (CHUCKLES)

44:50.729 --> 44:53.732
Yeah, moderate, sensible,
conservatism.

44:53.816 --> 44:56.068
Something radical
in that I suppose.

44:56.151 --> 44:59.488
Yes, she was one of my ablest.
Do give her my very best.

44:59.571 --> 45:04.034
-How did you two connect then?
-Well, through mutual friend.

45:04.118 --> 45:05.744
TUTOR: Hmm.

45:05.828 --> 45:07.788
-GUS: So...
-(SAUCER CLANKING)

45:07.871 --> 45:10.290
...I know this chap,
just out of Eton,

45:10.374 --> 45:13.001
who was interviewing
for History & Politics.

45:13.085 --> 45:16.463
Sadly, he didn't quite make
the cut, but I just wanted to,

45:16.547 --> 45:18.841
you know, shine
a light on him. (CHUCKLES)

45:19.716 --> 45:20.717
Leo Bloom.

45:20.801 --> 45:22.219
You may have heard
of his father Jesse,

45:22.302 --> 45:24.221
-he runs Crotona Park Capital.
-TUTOR: Oh, yeah, yeah.

45:24.304 --> 45:26.765
Of course, yeah, he was all over
the news at one point, right?

45:26.849 --> 45:29.226
Profiteering off misery.
(CHUCKLES)

45:29.309 --> 45:30.727
Yes.

45:30.811 --> 45:34.815
Um. Well his son Leo
is really very smart.

45:35.524 --> 45:36.859
You'd like his energy.

45:36.942 --> 45:38.277
He's a... (FINGER SNAPS)
...quick study.

45:38.360 --> 45:40.904
I-- I think you'd like spending
a few hours a week with him.

45:41.739 --> 45:43.240
So, I was just wondering

45:43.323 --> 45:44.867
if there was anything
we could, um...

45:45.826 --> 45:46.827
do?

45:48.328 --> 45:50.789
Uh. Do? (CHUCKLES)

45:52.040 --> 45:53.167
As regards? (CHUCKLES)

45:54.877 --> 45:56.336
Bump him up the ladder.

45:56.420 --> 45:58.839
Find him a place in college
for next Michaelmas.

45:59.756 --> 46:01.550
-(CHUCKLES)
-(CHUCKLES)

46:02.509 --> 46:04.011
(HESITATES) I mean...

46:04.094 --> 46:07.347
Uh. Well, we're--
we're not really set up

46:07.431 --> 46:09.808
for that sort of thing.

46:09.892 --> 46:12.686
I've been thinking recently,
actually speaking to Aurore,

46:12.769 --> 46:14.396
about how important it is
for us to give back

46:14.480 --> 46:16.982
to the institutions
that shape us.

46:17.065 --> 46:19.401
I thought perhaps there could
be some kind of conduit

46:19.485 --> 46:21.445
between the college
and the department.

46:21.528 --> 46:24.823
Maybe we could
make a parliamentary internship

46:24.907 --> 46:27.493
for one of the outgoing
PPE students.

46:28.744 --> 46:31.830
Uh. Well, it would be-- be great

46:31.914 --> 46:36.126
if-- if Aurore could come back
and speak to the finalists.

46:36.210 --> 46:39.755
We'd definitely be open
to starting those conversations.

46:39.838 --> 46:42.424
We only have six places for
History and Politics this year.

46:42.508 --> 46:43.884
Surely someone who'd love

46:43.967 --> 46:46.637
some potential work experience
in a minister's office.

46:46.720 --> 46:47.721
(CHUCKLES)

46:50.307 --> 46:51.517
Do you remember,

46:51.600 --> 46:54.228
uh, Stiffy a few years
above you at school?

46:54.311 --> 46:57.731
I think he went back and taught
Mandarin and cricket,

46:57.814 --> 47:00.067
house cricket,
when you were in B block.

47:00.150 --> 47:01.360
I helped him out a bit

47:01.443 --> 47:03.320
with the application here.
Nothing underhand of course,

47:03.403 --> 47:04.738
just a little advice.

47:04.821 --> 47:08.742
Well, um, Stiffy minor
has just landed

47:08.826 --> 47:11.870
a place in this year's intake.
I could...

47:11.954 --> 47:14.331
speak to him
about a potential gap year.

47:14.915 --> 47:16.124
I mean,

47:16.208 --> 47:18.252
that will certainly put him
in a better position for life

47:18.335 --> 47:20.712
-post-degree.
-(CHUCKLES)

47:20.796 --> 47:23.423
And this Leo is intelligent?

47:23.507 --> 47:25.551
-Very.
-TUTOR: And he's an OE?

47:26.593 --> 47:29.304
-Yup.
-(CHUCKLES) He's one of us.

47:29.388 --> 47:32.099
-A "PLU". (CHUCKLES)
-(GUS CHUCKLING)

47:32.182 --> 47:34.184
TUTOR: I'm-- I'm sure
we can figure something out.

47:34.268 --> 47:37.855
Let me speak to,
um, Stiffy's father.

47:39.439 --> 47:41.233
I always had you pegged
for politics.

47:46.238 --> 47:48.240
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

47:48.323 --> 47:50.409
You drink whisky
at a wake, right?

47:50.492 --> 47:51.493
(LAUGHS)

47:53.662 --> 47:55.205
RISHI: I just don't know, Eric.

47:57.499 --> 48:01.378
Know what? Uh.
Three more whiskeys. Doubles!

48:01.461 --> 48:02.754
RISHI: Why we brought you.

48:04.131 --> 48:05.716
You're fucking last mate,
honestly.

48:05.799 --> 48:06.967
HARPER: Don't talk
to him like that.

48:07.050 --> 48:08.302
Oh, you can fuck off and all.

48:08.385 --> 48:11.013
You're a total catastrophe.
I swear you're cursed.

48:14.641 --> 48:16.768
I'm gonna go back to the office.
Put my head down.

48:17.686 --> 48:20.230
We can't pretend
this didn't happen.

48:20.314 --> 48:24.276
Pierpoint finds out five minutes
from now or five minutes ago.

48:24.818 --> 48:26.236
Cat's voided bag.

48:27.279 --> 48:29.156
What about Credit Suisse...

48:29.239 --> 48:32.284
JP Morgan, MS, Barclays?
We can still try those, no?

48:32.367 --> 48:36.038
Some cunt will hit a lazy bid
and have us, surely?

48:36.121 --> 48:39.916
The chatter from today
will materially hurt us.

48:40.834 --> 48:42.794
If I was at any of those places

48:42.878 --> 48:45.964
and was to pick up the phone
to our equivalents now...

48:47.090 --> 48:49.718
desperation reeks
like cheap cologne.

48:51.345 --> 48:53.764
Do I look like
a Duty-Free kind of guy to you?

48:53.847 --> 48:57.142
ERIC: They'd offer us
an insulting package.

48:57.809 --> 48:58.852
Rightly so.

49:02.314 --> 49:04.149
I need a slash
something terrible.

49:07.569 --> 49:11.698
-(CELL PHONE BUZZING)
-ERIC: You should take that.

49:13.909 --> 49:17.329
(CELL PHONE CONTINUES BUZZING)

49:23.794 --> 49:26.088
DVD: Harper, I'm glad I got you.

49:26.171 --> 49:27.547
Yeah, what's up?

49:27.631 --> 49:29.591
Uh. Just having
the day from hell.

49:30.133 --> 49:32.302
Um. Look...

49:32.386 --> 49:35.555
I-- I think I know why you are
the way you are with me at work.

49:36.723 --> 49:37.683
I know

49:37.766 --> 49:40.686
people in this business
have hurt you.

49:40.769 --> 49:43.438
I know you feel you haven't been
able to speak out.

49:43.522 --> 49:46.733
I'm getting a lot of pressure
from above to bury it myself...

49:46.817 --> 49:52.114
but I-- I know
it's-- it's a pattern now.

49:52.197 --> 49:55.242
It's the whole damn culture.
It's fucking Adler, man.

49:55.325 --> 49:59.830
-I feel a bit sick.
-(DOOR CREAKING)

50:05.127 --> 50:06.962
Okay. I hear you. Um...

50:08.046 --> 50:10.632
Could we have this conversation
in person?

50:10.716 --> 50:12.259
DVD: No,
I can't get off the desk.

50:12.342 --> 50:14.386
I'd really like to have
this conversation in person.

50:14.469 --> 50:17.389
Now. Drink.
Usual spot. Right now.

50:20.016 --> 50:22.394
DVD: Okay, just--
just give me a couple minutes.

50:55.719 --> 50:57.637
News of our mutiny hit?

50:57.721 --> 50:59.139
HARPER: No,
it was something else.

51:01.266 --> 51:06.480
ERIC: How did we not know
the Yankees covered Bloom?

51:06.563 --> 51:11.443
We shouldn't have said
we "own" him. It was a lie.

51:11.526 --> 51:13.278
I did think
that he cut me loose,

51:13.361 --> 51:16.782
but, I mean, as ridiculous
as this sounds,

51:16.865 --> 51:19.618
the fact he hasn't stopped out
of that FastAide position

51:19.701 --> 51:21.828
means I'm still in his head.

51:21.912 --> 51:25.916
He's not the kinda guy who wants
anodyne, Daria-style,

51:25.999 --> 51:28.919
parrot of broker, no-coverage.
He wants edge.

51:31.671 --> 51:34.299
He wants someone who can say,
“I know for certain.”

51:43.975 --> 51:46.102
CELESTE: I think
that you're too good

51:46.186 --> 51:48.104
towards steady
income instruments.

51:48.188 --> 51:49.105
Too many bonds.

51:49.189 --> 51:51.566
And it would be fantastic
if it--

51:56.321 --> 51:59.157
I'm so sorry, um,
must be an emergency.

51:59.241 --> 52:01.034
Um. I'm so sorry.

52:10.043 --> 52:12.045
CELESTE:
Sportswashing objectively works,

52:12.128 --> 52:14.047
but buying a chunk
of Chelsea Football...

52:14.130 --> 52:16.258
KENNY: I need to have
a serious word with you.

52:16.341 --> 52:19.719
Venetia told me that she came
to you with, uh, something

52:19.803 --> 52:23.974
very serious, and your response
was very disappointing.

52:24.057 --> 52:27.227
From the outside, it looks like
you were trying to silence her?

52:28.436 --> 52:30.230
You do realize the facts

52:30.313 --> 52:32.440
presented to me lead me
to that conclusion.

52:33.775 --> 52:36.236
It's the exact opposite
of pastoral care.

52:36.319 --> 52:38.363
It's not the culture
we're trying to engender here.

52:38.446 --> 52:39.781
Are you fucking kidding me?

52:41.783 --> 52:44.494
Can you hear yourself? (EXHALES)

52:44.578 --> 52:46.454
You gave up the right
to be the "custodian"

52:46.538 --> 52:47.747
of any kind of culture

52:47.831 --> 52:50.917
when you paid for a girl's tits
to be bounced in my face.

52:51.001 --> 52:53.628
Forgive me for thinking
you shouldn't be the arbiter

52:53.712 --> 52:55.380
of how young women
are treated on your desk.

52:55.463 --> 52:57.007
Yes, I'm worried
about how this looks for you--

52:57.090 --> 52:58.216
No. Shut the fuck up
for a minute.

52:58.300 --> 52:59.593
How dare you pull me out
of a meeting

52:59.676 --> 53:02.012
to speak to me like this?
You don't get to lecture me.

53:03.680 --> 53:05.849
There's no high ground
for you anymore.

53:05.932 --> 53:07.309
I don't care
if you're sober, Kenny.

53:07.392 --> 53:09.019
You're still a cunt.

53:09.102 --> 53:10.770
That doesn't go away
with a few sessions

53:10.854 --> 53:11.897
with a bunch of other whingers.

53:11.980 --> 53:14.190
You don't have a disease,
you're a narcissist

53:14.274 --> 53:15.275
with a new excuse

53:15.358 --> 53:17.903
to lord it over people.
You're weak.

53:17.986 --> 53:19.237
In case
that wasn't crystal clear,

53:19.321 --> 53:21.406
no, I will not come
to your fucking meetings.

53:21.489 --> 53:23.408
No, sorry, you're right.
You're-- you're right.

53:37.172 --> 53:39.883
RISHI: Daniel. We're just, uh...
(CHUCKLES)

53:39.966 --> 53:43.261
We're just having
a couple of sneaky
on-the-clock sharpeners.

53:43.345 --> 53:47.182
-What the fuck's going on?
-Beats me.

53:49.017 --> 53:50.060
I asked him to come.

53:52.354 --> 53:53.355
You...

53:54.731 --> 53:55.732
What?

53:56.524 --> 53:57.943
HARPER: Danny, have a seat.

54:04.950 --> 54:07.243
Very soon it will be
common market knowledge

54:07.327 --> 54:10.288
that we've been taking
meetings away all day.

54:12.207 --> 54:13.208
(CHUCKLES)

54:19.089 --> 54:22.342
-Fuck you.
-Not fuck us. No.

54:22.425 --> 54:24.302
There is an opportunity here.

54:24.386 --> 54:27.931
A huge competitor has just
gutted a rival's CPS offering.

54:28.014 --> 54:30.350
There's a gap
to fill out the gutted firm.

54:30.433 --> 54:32.811
We're fixing a supply issue.

54:33.770 --> 54:35.480
Now, the way I see this is...

54:36.940 --> 54:38.900
you know how quickly
the clock ticks

54:38.984 --> 54:40.986
when you flirting
with a competitor.

54:41.069 --> 54:46.116
We need to secure this now.
We have hours. Not days.

54:47.534 --> 54:50.620
You can tell Adler,
stay at his heel.

54:51.705 --> 54:53.623
Or you can join us...

54:54.582 --> 54:56.126
and take what was denied to you.

54:58.211 --> 55:04.342
I can see Bill's POV.
Why promote a blind acolyte...

55:04.426 --> 55:08.138
when he can get you to do
more work for the same money?

55:08.221 --> 55:11.057
HARPER: Ultimately,
your loyalty is what cost you.

55:13.601 --> 55:16.146
You're still drinking buddies
with the guys over at Shogun,

55:16.229 --> 55:17.856
yeah?

55:17.939 --> 55:21.234
-Shogun?
-HARPER: Our Japanese brothers?

55:21.317 --> 55:22.944
You still hit up
the Slug and Lettuce

55:23.028 --> 55:24.112
with those guys?

55:24.696 --> 55:25.697
DVD: Oh...

55:27.115 --> 55:29.409
Yeah, sure.
I know everyone there.

55:29.492 --> 55:32.162
They've been making overtures
towards me for months.

55:32.245 --> 55:33.288
Well...

55:34.122 --> 55:35.206
the floor is yours.

55:40.086 --> 55:42.213
You guys really are
something else.

55:47.177 --> 55:48.928
So, fucking tell them that then.

55:54.225 --> 55:55.226
Uh...

55:58.354 --> 55:59.773
I'm an immediate MD.

56:02.567 --> 56:03.610
I run the desk.

56:05.445 --> 56:06.821
You all report to me.

56:08.031 --> 56:11.868
I run the comp pool.
And I'm paid like a trader.

56:11.951 --> 56:13.745
Percentage
of total commissions made.

56:13.828 --> 56:14.913
My upside is unlimited.

56:17.499 --> 56:18.541
Old-school.

56:20.627 --> 56:21.669
We can do that.

56:22.754 --> 56:23.797
Can't we, Eric?

56:25.632 --> 56:26.841
We can.

56:26.925 --> 56:28.968
You reckon you can feign
sobriety long enough

56:29.052 --> 56:30.261
for me to save your careers?

56:30.345 --> 56:32.388
ERIC: (CHUCKLES)
We'll fucking try.

56:35.558 --> 56:36.684
I'm gonna make a call.
