00:03.128 --> 00:04.629
Amy: Previously on
"Heartland"...

00:04.671 --> 00:06.423
- I'm sorry,
but the clinic's over.

00:06.464 --> 00:08.258
- Please, just look
at my horse.

00:08.299 --> 00:09.300
- She's gone?

00:09.342 --> 00:11.886
- The woman abandoned
her horse - to you.

00:11.928 --> 00:13.888
- Hi, Peter.
- Mitch, right?

00:13.930 --> 00:17.475
- Mitch, saved Monty's life
this morning.

00:17.517 --> 00:18.852
Peter: I can't get Lou
on the phone.

00:18.893 --> 00:20.311
I think she's avoiding
the issue.

00:20.353 --> 00:21.730
- (Huffs) What issue?

00:23.523 --> 00:24.482
- Divorce papers.

00:24.524 --> 00:25.650
- Dad, look out!

00:25.692 --> 00:27.277
(Huge bang)
- Ah!

00:27.318 --> 00:28.278
(Rocks thunder)
Amy: Dad!

00:28.319 --> 00:29.404
(Rocks clatter)

00:29.446 --> 00:30.447
- I'm gonna take the horse.

00:30.488 --> 00:33.158
I'm gonna ride up to where,
uh... the ranch.

00:33.199 --> 00:34.367
Man: Are you doctors?

00:34.409 --> 00:35.618
Ty: We're animal doctors.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.495
- A bear's been shot.

00:37.537 --> 00:38.913
It was a cub.

00:38.955 --> 00:40.331
Maybe wounded.

00:40.373 --> 00:42.375
- Look, man.
(Cub squeals)

00:42.417 --> 00:43.668
(Hard thwack)
(Cub grimaces in pain)

00:43.710 --> 00:46.588
(Horse whinnies shrilly)

00:46.629 --> 00:48.256
Georgie: Spartan.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.929
- (Pants)

00:54.971 --> 00:56.514
(Hooves thud)

00:59.309 --> 01:01.269
Spartan! (Panting)

01:02.687 --> 01:04.147
(Breathless)
Where's my dad?

01:04.188 --> 01:05.315
Where...

01:05.357 --> 01:06.441
Where is he?

01:06.483 --> 01:07.942
(Panting)

01:07.984 --> 01:09.152
- What happened?

01:09.194 --> 01:11.321
(Horse in trailer whinnies
shrilly, bangs hooves)

01:11.363 --> 01:13.948
- Amy said it was just gonna be
a short clinic.

01:13.990 --> 01:16.534
They left right after
lunch to get there.

01:16.576 --> 01:18.453
- Well, where was it?
The clinic?

01:19.996 --> 01:20.997
Grandpa, you must know!

01:21.039 --> 01:23.500
Well, it was somewhere
in the Kananaskis,

01:23.541 --> 01:25.835
but I never did get
the name of the ranch

01:25.877 --> 01:27.671
or the person that hired Amy.

01:27.712 --> 01:29.798
- And why-why was Amy doing
a clinic in the first place?

01:29.839 --> 01:30.840
She's six months pregnant!

01:30.882 --> 01:33.593
- Can we not get into that?

01:33.635 --> 01:36.805
Let's just find out where
the clinic was being held.

01:39.557 --> 01:41.601
- There's only one thing
I can do.

01:41.643 --> 01:42.727
I'm riding back towards
Karen's.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.854
- Georgie...
- No, I can find Tim.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.106
- I'm the one who should go.

01:46.147 --> 01:48.817
- No, you can't ride.
You know that! There's no way!

01:48.858 --> 01:50.902
Besides, you should stay here
with him.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.029
(Horse whinnies shrilly,
bangs trailer)

01:53.071 --> 01:54.739
Amy: All right,
just be careful.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.157
- I'll be back.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.494
(Clicks tongue)
(Hooves thud)

02:00.912 --> 02:02.664
(Horse whinnies shrilly)

02:02.706 --> 02:04.499
(Mongolian music)

02:07.627 --> 02:08.669
(Jeep rattles)

02:10.255 --> 02:12.590
- Can you hold this?

02:12.632 --> 02:14.342
- Here.
(Chain clanks)

02:16.386 --> 02:18.888
You got it?
- Yeah, yeah!

02:18.930 --> 02:20.640
(Jeep rattles and bangs)
- Oh Jeez!

02:20.682 --> 02:23.601
- Watch it! The IV'll pop out!
- Yeah!

02:23.643 --> 02:25.353
- It is what it is, man!

02:27.313 --> 02:28.773
(Hooves clop)

02:28.815 --> 02:31.901
- Tim!

02:31.943 --> 02:33.611
Tim!

02:33.653 --> 02:36.448
(Horse whinnies shrilly,
bangs trailer)

02:36.489 --> 02:38.408
- Hey, boy.
(Horse whinnies shrilly)

02:38.450 --> 02:39.784
How you doin' in there, huh?

02:39.826 --> 02:42.203
(Horse bangs
and whinnies anxiously)

02:43.997 --> 02:45.540
I know.

02:45.582 --> 02:46.708
We're gonna get you out, okay?

02:46.750 --> 02:47.959
(Horse whinnies shrilly)

02:48.001 --> 02:49.419
You'll be fine.

02:49.461 --> 02:50.879
(Horse whinnies in distress)

02:50.920 --> 02:52.547
(Tearful) We'll be fine.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.632
(Horse whinnies anxiously)

02:54.674 --> 02:55.884
(Dramatic music)

02:55.925 --> 03:07.228
**

03:09.689 --> 03:19.741
**

03:19.741 --> 03:24.954
**

03:24.996 --> 03:29.584
* And at the break of day
you sank into your dream *

03:31.920 --> 03:33.380
* You dreamer *

03:33.421 --> 03:35.965
* Oh, oh, oh, oh *

03:36.007 --> 03:37.759
* You dreamer *

03:40.387 --> 03:43.431
* You dreamer *

03:51.064 --> 03:53.566
(Horse whinnies)

03:53.608 --> 03:56.444
- Come on, Amy. You must have
updated your calendar.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.446
- She's been busy.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.868
- Here's somethin'. Uh, Karen.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.453
There's a phone number on it,
too.

04:05.495 --> 04:06.705
I can't really make it out.

04:06.746 --> 04:10.500
- Karen. Yeah, that sounds
familiar.

04:10.542 --> 04:12.377
- Lou?

04:12.419 --> 04:13.795
Hey, Lou, you're back!

04:13.837 --> 04:15.505
Lou: Hey.

04:15.547 --> 04:16.505
- Hey, Jack.

04:16.548 --> 04:17.548
- Hi, Mitch.

04:17.589 --> 04:19.050
- Peter.

04:19.091 --> 04:20.719
- Hey.

04:23.430 --> 04:24.514
- Good trip back?

04:24.556 --> 04:27.100
- Uh, no, actually, awful,
storms everywhere.

04:27.142 --> 04:29.019
- Oh. Not good.
(Phone beeps)

04:29.060 --> 04:31.187
- Hey, did Amy say anything to
you about a clinic

04:31.229 --> 04:33.231
she was supposed to do today?

04:33.273 --> 04:36.067
- No. I mean, I knew she was
going, but...

04:36.109 --> 04:37.610
Why? Is there a problem?

04:37.652 --> 04:38.862
- No, no problem.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.113
- Big problem.

04:40.155 --> 04:42.532
They were supposed to be back
by now and they're not.

04:42.574 --> 04:45.035
Jack: Hello, is this Karen?

04:45.076 --> 04:47.162
Hi, my name's Jack Bartlett.

04:47.203 --> 04:49.914
I'm Amy Fleming's grandfather.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.167
Can you tell me,
did Amy run a clinic

04:52.208 --> 04:55.170
for you this afternoon?

04:55.211 --> 04:57.005
So, it's over then?

04:57.047 --> 04:59.632
I see.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.509
When did they leave?

05:02.635 --> 05:04.012
That long ago.

05:05.472 --> 05:08.475
(Ominous music)

05:08.516 --> 05:09.517
(Birds chirp, grass rustles)

05:09.559 --> 05:11.519
- (Grunts softly)

05:11.561 --> 05:13.688
(Birds chirp, grass rustles)

05:14.939 --> 05:16.775
- (Grimaces)

05:17.942 --> 05:18.943
(Grunts quietly)

05:18.985 --> 05:20.779
(Sound distorts)

05:24.657 --> 05:25.784
(Gasps)

05:28.036 --> 05:31.539
(Leaves rustle in the wind)

05:31.581 --> 05:33.708
(Hooves clop)

05:33.750 --> 05:35.543
- Tim!

05:35.585 --> 05:39.089
(Spartan whinnies softly)

05:39.130 --> 05:42.175
Tim!

05:42.217 --> 05:43.802
- (Faltering exhale)

05:43.843 --> 05:46.554
- Tim!

05:46.596 --> 05:48.807
(Hooves clop)

05:52.018 --> 05:54.521
(Spartan whinnies sharply)
Hey, whoa!

05:54.562 --> 05:57.691
Whoa, bud, easy.
(Spartan snorts)

05:57.732 --> 05:59.651
Tim!

05:59.693 --> 06:01.611
- (Weakly) Georgie...

06:01.653 --> 06:04.114
(Spartan snorts aggressively)

06:04.155 --> 06:05.490
- Spartan, easy!

06:05.532 --> 06:06.616
(Spartan snorts sharply)

06:06.658 --> 06:08.660
Spartan!

06:08.702 --> 06:09.744
(Spartan whinnies sharply)

06:09.786 --> 06:11.955
Hey! Whoa!

06:11.996 --> 06:14.124
Come on! (Clicks tongue)
Let's go!

06:14.165 --> 06:17.627
(Spartan snorts angrily)
Spartan! We can't go back!

06:17.669 --> 06:18.795
(Spartan whinnies fiercely)

06:18.837 --> 06:20.880
Easy.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.757
Shh.

06:26.302 --> 06:28.221
Oh my God! Tim!

06:28.263 --> 06:31.016
- The Highway 40 comes out
of the Kananaskis,

06:31.057 --> 06:32.934
meets up with the Trans Canada
right there.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.102
You see that line?

06:34.144 --> 06:35.895
That means there's
no accidents reported there.

06:35.937 --> 06:38.189
- Well, Tim hardly ever takes
the main roads.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.941
He likes the shortcuts.

06:39.983 --> 06:40.817
- All right, look,
well, here's...

06:40.859 --> 06:43.445
here's Karen's ranch right here
and...

06:44.738 --> 06:46.239
and here's an alternate route.

06:46.281 --> 06:48.158
Jack: See? That's exactly
the kind of route

06:48.199 --> 06:51.161
Tim Fleming would take for sure.

06:51.202 --> 06:54.164
Okay, I'm goin'.
Thank you, Lou.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.749
Can I take that map?

06:55.790 --> 06:57.208
- Uh, yeah, but...

06:57.250 --> 06:58.335
Peter: I'll-I'll come
with ya.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.712
- No, I'm fine on my own.
- No, he's right, Jack.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.213
- Jack, just let me come.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.883
- Actually, I was-I was thinkin'
we should take my truck,

07:04.924 --> 07:06.176
in case we need the tools
or anything.

07:06.217 --> 07:07.260
I've got everything.

07:07.302 --> 07:10.597
Jack: Okay. That's good.
You and I'll go then.

07:10.638 --> 07:11.598
- Where are you going GG?

07:11.639 --> 07:14.976
- Well, I have to go out
for a while, okay?

07:15.018 --> 07:16.227
- Are you going too, Mitch?

07:16.269 --> 07:18.229
- Yeah, goin' to keep
him company.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.856
Jack and I are on an important
mission.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.192
- Like a superhero mission?

07:22.233 --> 07:24.652
- Ah... not really.

07:26.237 --> 07:27.781
- Bye, Mitch.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.325
- Okay. Bye.

07:30.367 --> 07:33.161
- Okay, good luck, and, um,
you guys keep in touch.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.080
- Yeah, we'll keep in touch
as long as we can.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.707
- Bye, GG. Bye, Mitch.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.918
(Door shuts)

07:39.959 --> 07:41.670
- (Small smirk)

07:43.963 --> 07:46.508
Your farm hand's a real hero
to our daughter, huh?

07:53.306 --> 07:56.101
(Hooves clop)

07:56.142 --> 07:57.310
Georgie: Tim!

07:57.352 --> 07:59.854
- (Pants)

07:59.896 --> 08:01.022
- Oh my God, you're...

08:01.064 --> 08:03.191
you're really hurt. Here.

08:03.233 --> 08:06.986
Do you want to try
to stand up?

08:07.028 --> 08:08.279
- (Grunts)
- Come on.

08:08.321 --> 08:11.074
We could ride Spartan together
or I could lead you?

08:11.116 --> 08:14.369
Here.
- (Grunts)

08:14.411 --> 08:16.413
- (Grunts loudly)

08:16.454 --> 08:17.330
- (Gasps with effort)
- (Grunts)

08:17.372 --> 08:20.041
Okay, okay, okay, ah, ah!
- Ah Tim!

08:21.835 --> 08:23.628
It's okay. Here!

08:23.670 --> 08:24.713
Come on. Just...

08:26.965 --> 08:29.009
- (Grunts)
- (Grunts)

08:29.050 --> 08:30.135

08:39.352 --> 08:42.688
(Jeep rumbles)

08:42.731 --> 08:43.982
(Tires skid)

08:44.024 --> 08:45.191
- A cub?

08:45.233 --> 08:46.693
Is it okay?

08:46.735 --> 08:48.653
- It's been better.

08:48.695 --> 08:49.904
Ty: It's shot.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.197
The mother's dead.

08:51.239 --> 08:52.949
- This little guy might still
have a chance though.

08:52.991 --> 08:54.868
All: (Grunt with effort)

08:56.161 --> 08:59.080
- You guys got it?
- Yup.

08:59.122 --> 09:01.041
(Goat bleats)

09:01.082 --> 09:02.667
(Mongolian music)

09:02.709 --> 09:11.843
**

09:11.885 --> 09:13.261
(Goat bleats)

09:14.888 --> 09:16.681
- What's goin' on, Lou?

09:18.892 --> 09:20.477
You told me yourself that there
is somethin' there,

09:20.518 --> 09:21.978
that you wanted to see
where it might go.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.146
Well, it obviously went
somewhere, right?

09:23.188 --> 09:24.898
- What do you care if
I'm seeing someone or not?!

09:24.939 --> 09:26.399
(Whispers) You're here with
the divorce papers!

09:26.441 --> 09:29.277
- I care. Of course I care!

09:29.319 --> 09:30.987
- I've always cared.
I always will.

09:31.029 --> 09:32.989
I told you that.
I am trying to understand

09:33.031 --> 09:35.033
the situation that I find
myself in here, okay?

09:35.075 --> 09:36.868
- There is no situation.

09:36.910 --> 09:37.911
- You sound upset there isn't.

09:37.952 --> 09:40.622
- No, I'm just...
I'm embarrassed, okay?

09:40.663 --> 09:42.707
I'm embarrassed that
I even said anything to you

09:42.749 --> 09:45.126
about it at all.

09:45.168 --> 09:46.628
God.

09:46.670 --> 09:50.715
So, let's just get to the task
at hand, you know?

09:50.757 --> 09:53.218
The reason you're here.

09:53.259 --> 09:56.388
- That's...that's not the reason
I came here.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.932
I also came to see the girls.

09:58.973 --> 10:01.309
I came to see you.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.395
Why are you in such a hurry
with this?

10:03.436 --> 10:05.563
You know, signing the papers?

10:05.605 --> 10:08.441
You've been bugging me
about this for weeks.

10:08.483 --> 10:10.360
- I'm not...

10:10.402 --> 10:14.906
It's not, it's not that
I'm in a hurry. I just, I...

10:14.948 --> 10:17.909
I just, I thought we should...

10:17.951 --> 10:20.412
we should just get it done
so that we can...

10:20.453 --> 10:22.372
I don't know, move on, right?

10:22.414 --> 10:24.290
God, I hate those words.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.169
(Sighs heavily)

10:28.211 --> 10:30.005
Forget it.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.965
Just forget it. We got other
things to worry about now,

10:32.007 --> 10:35.343
like if I can get my daughter
to actually talk to me.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.095
- Peter...

10:42.350 --> 10:44.853
(Grimaces in pain)
- Woo, walk it off.

10:44.894 --> 10:46.187
(Gasps and pants)

10:47.439 --> 10:49.190
(Horse snorts quietly)

10:52.318 --> 10:55.238
You okay, boy?

10:55.280 --> 10:57.198
What's goin' on?

10:57.240 --> 10:59.159
(Panting)

11:02.912 --> 11:04.956
It's okay, I'm right here.

11:04.998 --> 11:08.168
(Grunts and pants)

11:08.209 --> 11:09.252
Don't give up on me.

11:09.294 --> 11:11.713
What's goin' on?

11:12.964 --> 11:14.424
(Grimaces sharply) Ah!

11:14.466 --> 11:16.051
(Gasps in pain)

11:18.845 --> 11:19.220
Oh! Ow!

11:22.182 --> 11:24.059
(Gasps in pain)

11:24.100 --> 11:26.227
(Tearful) Please be okay.

11:26.269 --> 11:28.355
(Gasps and pants)

11:30.023 --> 11:32.525
Oh, please be okay. I'm sorry.

11:32.567 --> 11:35.362
(Gasps and pants)
(Horse snorts quietly)

11:36.863 --> 11:39.240
Yeah.

11:39.282 --> 11:40.992
It's okay. I'm right here.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.703
(Pants) It's okay.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.291
We're gonna be okay.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.919
(Pants)

11:54.214 --> 11:56.091
(Horse whinnies softly)

11:57.342 --> 11:59.427
- Here, come on, Tim.
- (Grunts softly)

11:59.469 --> 12:01.346
- Come on!
(Grunts with effort)

12:01.388 --> 12:04.057
Okay, let's move this.

12:04.099 --> 12:05.517
Okay, come on.
Let's try again.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.353
- (Grunts)

12:08.395 --> 12:10.397
- You gotta do-
just get to Spartan

12:10.438 --> 12:13.108
and you can lean on him.
- (Gasps weakly)

12:13.149 --> 12:15.276
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

12:15.318 --> 12:17.195
- Where's Amy? How's Amy?
- She's, she's fine.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.363
- Oh, hold on, hold on.
- Whoa whoa.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.323
- I gotta sit, I gotta sit.
- Okay.

12:20.365 --> 12:23.243
- Oh, this is not good, honey.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.953
Ah!

12:28.915 --> 12:30.125
(Goat bleats)

12:33.503 --> 12:35.130
(Machine beeps)

12:37.549 --> 12:39.134
(Machine beeps)

12:40.677 --> 12:42.387
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

12:42.429 --> 12:45.515
Bob: Hey, Ty.
- What do you think?

12:45.557 --> 12:46.599
- The bullet's sitting
just below a rib,

12:46.641 --> 12:49.102
close to the spine.

12:49.144 --> 12:50.186
(Door opens)

12:50.228 --> 12:52.188
Gavin: Hey, guys,
you can't go in there!

12:52.230 --> 12:53.148
(Door bangs open)
No, no, no, no.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.233
Hey, guys!

12:55.275 --> 13:01.197
**

13:01.239 --> 13:02.323
- Hey, man.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.827
(Dramatic music)

13:08.455 --> 13:10.707
- Look, guys,
what's the problem?

13:10.749 --> 13:13.293
- We gave you the information
about the bear and cub,

13:13.335 --> 13:17.339
and this guy, he posted
a reward for information.

13:17.380 --> 13:18.381
Isn't that true?

13:18.423 --> 13:21.176
- That's the first
we've heard about it.

13:21.217 --> 13:23.345
- That's what people
in the village are saying.

13:23.386 --> 13:25.638
A reward.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.140
Will you honour your word?!

13:27.182 --> 13:28.641
- What's this reward, man?

13:28.683 --> 13:31.728
- Okay, I posted a reward
for any information.

13:31.770 --> 13:34.189
It helps with the cause.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.608
- So where is the money?!
Where is our reward?!

13:36.649 --> 13:38.109
- Look, I'm sorry, but you guys
don't deserve, like,

13:38.151 --> 13:39.778
any kind of reward, okay?!

13:39.819 --> 13:42.238
Ty: Hey, hey, hey, hey,
whoa, whoa, easy now.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.948
Calm down, all right?
Calm down!

13:43.990 --> 13:45.325
You told us about the dead bear

13:45.367 --> 13:47.535
and you said a cub
might have escaped,

13:47.577 --> 13:48.661
but you coulda helped
us find him.

13:48.703 --> 13:51.664
- But you didn't, did you?
All that wasted time!

13:51.706 --> 13:53.708
- Look, there's the cub
right there, okay?

13:53.750 --> 13:54.626
He's got a bullet in him.

13:54.668 --> 13:57.170
It just barely missed
his vitals.

13:57.212 --> 13:59.255
His heart! His lungs!
He's bleeding right now.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.883
We need to perform surgery,
so you need to leave!

14:03.426 --> 14:05.303
Now!

14:05.345 --> 14:07.180
- (Speaks in Mongolian)

14:08.515 --> 14:10.392
(Receding footsteps)
(Door opens and closes)

14:10.433 --> 14:12.060
- (Exhales nervously)

14:12.102 --> 14:14.229
- You ready?
- Ready, boss.

14:18.191 --> 14:21.736
**

14:21.778 --> 14:23.530
- Hey! Hey-hey-hey!

14:24.614 --> 14:25.573
(Car rumbles)

14:29.160 --> 14:30.286
(Car stops)

14:30.328 --> 14:31.746
- Karen!

14:31.788 --> 14:33.415
- Georgie?
(Door shuts)

14:33.456 --> 14:35.333
Oh my God, Tim!

14:35.375 --> 14:37.252
Are you okay?

14:37.293 --> 14:38.628
What happened? Where's Amy?!

14:38.670 --> 14:40.672
- She's back at the trailer.
We got into a crash.

14:40.714 --> 14:41.798
- There was a rock slide.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.466
- We, we drove right into it.

14:43.508 --> 14:44.426
- Is she all right?!

14:44.467 --> 14:45.635
- Yeah, she's, she's fine.

14:45.677 --> 14:47.178
- (Grimaces) Ow.
- Oh my God!

14:47.220 --> 14:48.805
- Okay...

14:48.847 --> 14:49.806
- Tim?
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

14:49.848 --> 14:51.808
- Yeah, just a few steps

14:51.850 --> 14:54.019
and Georgie and I can get
you into the car, okay?

14:54.060 --> 14:55.395
- Okay?
- Yup.

14:55.437 --> 14:56.730
- How did you know where
we were?

14:56.771 --> 14:58.440
- Uh, Jack called.

14:58.481 --> 15:00.734
It was getting late
and he was worried and...

15:00.775 --> 15:02.610
So I knew something must
have gone wrong.

15:02.652 --> 15:05.155
- Right.
(Door opens)

15:05.196 --> 15:08.825
- Okay, Tim. Okay, be careful.
- (Grunts)

15:08.867 --> 15:10.910
- Okay.
Georgie: He's okay.

15:10.952 --> 15:13.288
- Keep it... Okay, careful.
(Door shuts)

15:13.329 --> 15:14.956
- Your hat.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.210
- Okay, let's go get Amy now.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.421
- Okay, I'll follow you.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.051
(Hooves clop)

15:26.092 --> 15:29.554
(Car rumbles)

15:29.596 --> 15:31.139
(Hooves clop)

15:31.181 --> 15:33.516
(Birds chirp)

15:33.558 --> 15:36.686
(Fire crackles)

15:36.728 --> 15:39.189
(Door lightly shuts)

15:39.230 --> 15:41.066
(Fire crackles)

15:43.109 --> 15:45.362
(Page rustles)

15:45.403 --> 15:48.198
- I just read Katie a story.

15:48.239 --> 15:50.241
She actually seemed happy.
(Small chuckle)

15:50.283 --> 15:51.701
- Good.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.453
(Fire crackles)

15:57.248 --> 15:59.334
Makes it feel pretty final.

16:02.712 --> 16:05.006
- Make you feel differently
about things?

16:07.676 --> 16:09.511
- I don't know.
It's just weird.

16:10.804 --> 16:13.431
It's surreal, you know?

16:13.473 --> 16:15.600
It's like we sign this we're
both pretty much out there

16:15.642 --> 16:18.228
on our own from now on.

16:18.269 --> 16:20.438
- No. No, we're not.

16:21.690 --> 16:24.651
Listen, I, I, I am totally up
for putting in the extra time

16:24.693 --> 16:27.612
with the girls while you work
on this Maggie's project.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.698
I want to do it.

16:30.949 --> 16:33.326
I mean, more to the point,
I need to.

16:34.703 --> 16:37.205
- Thank you. They need you.

16:37.247 --> 16:38.623
- (Small chuckle)

16:38.665 --> 16:41.334
Hope so.
- Of course they do, Peter.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.172
- Yeah, I gotta admit
I am little worried

16:46.214 --> 16:49.384
that they're just gonna
gradually forget

16:49.426 --> 16:52.470
I actually exist.
(Small chuckle)

16:52.512 --> 16:53.930
Other people are bound
to fill the gap.

16:53.972 --> 16:55.348
I mean, it's happening already.

16:55.390 --> 16:57.851
- Okay, I get where this
is coming from,

16:57.892 --> 17:00.937
but this sudden infatuation
that Katie has for Mitch?

17:00.979 --> 17:02.814
That's just what it is.

17:02.856 --> 17:06.568
It's a little girl's
temporary fascination.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.739
- Yours too?
- With Mitch?

17:13.700 --> 17:16.536
Maybe.
- (Chuckles)

17:18.538 --> 17:20.248
- (Exhales emotionally)

17:20.290 --> 17:22.250
- Peter, Katie loves you.

17:23.792 --> 17:27.088
She... she counts the hours
'til your visits.

17:27.130 --> 17:29.883
She talks about you at bedtime
every night. She...

17:29.924 --> 17:31.885
She's been working
on a birthday present

17:31.926 --> 17:33.845
for you for days.

17:33.887 --> 17:37.557
Oh my God,
it's your birthday tomorrow.

17:37.599 --> 17:39.517
- The good times just
keep on rollin'.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.436
(Small chuckle)

17:41.478 --> 17:42.979
- (Sighs)

17:43.021 --> 17:46.733
- This is my second time
through this, Lou.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.570
Two marriages. Two divorces.

17:51.696 --> 17:54.324
(Small chuckles)

17:54.366 --> 17:56.743
Two.

17:56.785 --> 17:59.412
So, I'm obviously a bit
of a disaster

17:59.454 --> 18:01.373
when it comes to marriage.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.500
- You're not a disaster.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.460
- (Chuckles)

18:08.672 --> 18:11.299
- And you'll always be a good
Dad to the girls.

18:11.341 --> 18:13.551
(Fire crackles)

18:17.389 --> 18:19.140
(Truck hums)

18:20.392 --> 18:22.686
Jack: I think Range Road 56
is the next right.

18:22.727 --> 18:24.646
Mitch: Yeah, I see it.

18:24.688 --> 18:26.564
(Mongolian music)

18:26.606 --> 18:41.246
**

18:41.287 --> 18:49.004
**

18:49.045 --> 18:51.339
(Crickets chirp)

18:51.381 --> 18:53.299
(Car hums)

18:57.303 --> 18:58.847
- Hey!

19:00.432 --> 19:02.183
Karen! Oh my God. Dad!

19:03.601 --> 19:04.978
- I'm fine.
- You sure?

19:05.020 --> 19:06.438
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- What happened?

19:06.479 --> 19:07.856
- Tim, you shouldn't stand up!

19:07.897 --> 19:09.607
Tim: Don't make it sound
worse than it is.

19:09.649 --> 19:10.775
- We need to get you
to a hospital.

19:10.817 --> 19:11.776
- And you, pregnant lady,

19:11.818 --> 19:13.069
you need to get checked out too.

19:13.111 --> 19:15.655
- I know, but--
Tim: Karen.

19:15.697 --> 19:16.948
There's no way
you're gonna talk Amy

19:16.990 --> 19:18.658
outta stayin' with these horses.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.618
Trust me.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.121
Oh, honey, Jack's on his way.

19:23.163 --> 19:25.915
I want you to make
me a promise -

19:25.957 --> 19:28.084
promise me that as soon
as Jack arrives

19:28.126 --> 19:30.545
you make seeing a doctor
your first priority, please?

19:30.587 --> 19:32.047
- I will.

19:32.088 --> 19:33.715
Tim: I'm sorry about this.

19:33.757 --> 19:35.467
(Kiss) I'm sorry.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.469
- I love you.

19:39.012 --> 19:40.847
(Door opens)
(Hooves thud)

19:40.889 --> 19:42.557
(Doors close)
- Okay.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.352
(Car rumbles)

19:46.561 --> 19:47.979
- Georgie!

19:48.021 --> 19:49.898
(Hooves thud)

19:51.816 --> 19:52.901
Georgie.

19:52.942 --> 19:54.736
Hey. Are you all right?

19:54.778 --> 19:58.156
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Good boy, Spartan.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.616
(Horse in trailer whinnies)
- You still got cramps?

19:59.657 --> 20:02.994
- Yeah. I'm okay.
- Okay.

20:03.036 --> 20:04.913
(Horse in trailer whinnies
and bangs loudly)

20:06.373 --> 20:08.833
- Steady as she goes.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.919
(Instruments clatter)

20:16.966 --> 20:19.260
- Oh, shoot!
- No, you've got it.

20:20.387 --> 20:21.930
- (Grunts)

20:27.435 --> 20:29.270
Okay. Yup.
- You got it?

20:31.314 --> 20:33.566
- (Grunts)

20:33.608 --> 20:34.651
(Relieved exhale)

20:34.693 --> 20:35.819
- Good one.

20:35.860 --> 20:37.987

20:38.029 --> 20:39.614
(Bullet clatters in pan)

20:41.032 --> 20:42.617
- Okay, yup.

20:47.622 --> 20:49.624
(Crickets chirp)
(Truck rumbles)

20:49.666 --> 20:51.376
Mitch: There's the truck!

20:51.418 --> 20:52.711
Jack: Oh geez!

20:52.752 --> 20:54.713
(Truck rumbles to stop)

Tim!

21:02.095 --> 21:03.513
- Amy!

21:03.555 --> 21:05.432
- Grandpa! Grandpa!
- Yeah!

21:06.516 --> 21:07.892
Amy: Grandpa, we're here!

21:07.934 --> 21:09.477
Georgie: Oh you found us!

21:09.519 --> 21:11.021
- You're okay!

21:11.062 --> 21:12.439
- Where's your dad?
Where's Tim?

21:12.480 --> 21:13.773
- Karen took him
to the hospital.

21:13.815 --> 21:15.608
- The hospital?
- In Canmore.

21:15.650 --> 21:17.861
He hit his head in the crash.
- Really bad!

21:17.902 --> 21:19.195
- How about you? Are you okay?

21:19.237 --> 21:20.989
- I'm, yeah.
- She's got cramps.

21:22.699 --> 21:24.576
- I'm fine. There's a horse.

21:24.617 --> 21:25.785
We gotta get him out
of the trailer!

21:25.827 --> 21:27.245
- Spartan's standin'
right there.

21:27.287 --> 21:29.831
- No, Grandpa, there's another
horse! He's trapped!

21:29.873 --> 21:31.124
(Grunts)

21:31.166 --> 21:32.208
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

21:32.250 --> 21:35.837
- The trailer's twisted.
Let's see what we can do.

21:35.879 --> 21:38.423
(Winch clanks and squeaks)

21:38.465 --> 21:39.507
(Chains clink)

21:41.968 --> 21:43.845
(Winch clanks and bangs)

21:45.096 --> 21:48.808
**

21:48.850 --> 21:50.477
(Loud metallic bang)

21:51.686 --> 21:52.937
(Door squeaks open)

21:52.979 --> 21:54.856
(Hoof thumps)

21:54.898 --> 21:56.149
Jack: Amy, don't! Get back!

21:56.191 --> 21:58.777
- No, Grandpa, it's okay.
He's tied.

21:58.818 --> 22:01.237
- You don't know what shape
he's in. He could panic.

22:01.279 --> 22:03.698
(Horse bangs hoof and snorts)

22:04.908 --> 22:06.201
(Hoof bangs)
Amy: It's okay, good boy.

22:06.242 --> 22:08.787
No. You're okay.

22:08.828 --> 22:11.331
Oh no. He's super dehydrated.

22:11.373 --> 22:13.875
Georgie, can you grab a bucket
of water by the truck?!

22:13.917 --> 22:15.794
Georgie: I'm on it!
- Thanks.

22:15.835 --> 22:18.088
It's okay.

22:18.129 --> 22:19.547
I don't see any cuts
or physical injuries.

22:19.589 --> 22:21.675
Georgie: Here's the water.

22:21.716 --> 22:23.760
- Does look in pretty good
shape considerin'.

22:23.802 --> 22:26.763
- (Sighs) Hey, you're okay.

22:26.805 --> 22:28.264
- Amy, please, get out
of the trailer. I can do this.

22:28.306 --> 22:30.392
- I'll be fine. He knows me.

22:30.433 --> 22:33.144
Why don't you go get some hay?
It might help calm him down.

22:33.186 --> 22:34.771
- Yeah, okay.

22:34.813 --> 22:37.482
- It's okay. There you go.
(Water sloshes)

22:37.524 --> 22:39.734
Oh, good boy!

22:39.776 --> 22:41.152
- Let's go, Spartan.
(Door clanks open)

22:41.194 --> 22:42.654
You're all right.

22:42.696 --> 22:44.072
(Hooves clop)

22:45.490 --> 22:46.574
Come on.

22:46.616 --> 22:48.410
(Hooves thump in trailer)

22:49.619 --> 22:51.913
(Truck hood clanks)

22:51.955 --> 22:54.124
- Lot of good years
outta that truck.

22:54.165 --> 22:55.667
- You think it's write off?

22:55.709 --> 22:58.169
- Oh, I'd say so, yeah.

22:58.211 --> 23:00.088
- I loved this truck.

23:00.130 --> 23:03.299
- Yeah, me too.

23:03.341 --> 23:05.093
- If I hadn't done that clinic
then...

23:05.135 --> 23:08.096
- It's just a truck, Amy.

23:08.138 --> 23:11.099
There's a lot more precious
things than that.

23:11.141 --> 23:16.896
**

23:16.938 --> 23:18.773
(Truck and trailer rattle)

23:19.858 --> 23:25.864
**

23:25.905 --> 23:27.991
Lou: Listen, when the doctor
gets a minute

23:28.033 --> 23:30.243
could you ask him to give
me a call?

23:30.285 --> 23:32.704
Thank you. Okay.
(Phone beeps off)

23:32.746 --> 23:35.915
So they say Dad's good.
Mild concussion, apparently,

23:35.957 --> 23:38.460
but, uh, he's giving them
a really hard time of course

23:38.501 --> 23:40.628
and they don't think
they can get him to stay
through the night.

23:40.670 --> 23:41.796
- Surprise, surprise.

23:41.838 --> 23:43.965
- I'm glad Casey's with him.
(Truck door shuts)

23:44.007 --> 23:46.217
There they are.

23:46.259 --> 23:48.345
Hey! Ah!

23:48.386 --> 23:49.846
Thank goodness you're home!
Are you okay?

23:49.888 --> 23:52.265
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Hi.

23:52.307 --> 23:54.476
- Yeah, Mitch got us
there and back safe.

23:54.517 --> 23:56.936
- I'm so glad you're back.
I have so much to tell you!

23:56.978 --> 23:59.564
- And you? Are you okay?
- Yeah.

23:59.606 --> 24:01.024
- Are you sure?

24:01.066 --> 24:02.942
- Lou, I got checked out
by a Doctor in Canmore.

24:02.984 --> 24:05.278
We're both fine.
- Good. Oh, look at you!

24:05.320 --> 24:07.364
You're showing even more!

24:07.405 --> 24:08.990
What were you thinking, Amy?

24:09.032 --> 24:10.200
Doing a clinic way out
in the mountains?

24:10.241 --> 24:13.203
- I don't get it.
- Okay, please, please,
don't start.

24:13.244 --> 24:15.121
(Sighs heavily)

24:15.163 --> 24:16.998
I'm glad you're home.
(Small chuckle)

24:17.040 --> 24:18.958
- You too.

24:21.419 --> 24:22.879
(Instruments clank in tray)

24:22.921 --> 24:25.173
- We are doin' good.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.803
- Okay.
(Instrument clanks in tray)

24:32.972 --> 24:34.641
Okay, it's in.

24:35.934 --> 24:37.477
Ty: Yeah, I got it.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.604
Bob: Now we just need to
recreate a vacuum in the chest.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.856
- Okay.

24:44.609 --> 24:46.403
- That should do it.

24:46.444 --> 24:48.530
- All right, let's see if
he can breathe on his own.

24:52.659 --> 24:54.202
- (Sighs)

25:00.834 --> 25:02.836
(Computer dials)

25:07.132 --> 25:08.967
(Computer dials)

25:14.264 --> 25:15.974
- (Sighs)

25:16.016 --> 25:18.727
(Dialing stops)

25:18.768 --> 25:20.311
- (Sighs)

25:20.353 --> 25:22.230
(Crickets chirp)

25:34.451 --> 25:38.163
(Machine starts to beep)

25:38.204 --> 25:39.330
Bob: The O2 saturation.

25:39.372 --> 25:40.999
His blood pressure's dropping.

25:41.041 --> 25:43.209
- His heart rate's increasing.

25:43.251 --> 25:44.836
- It's probably just fluid
in the pericardial sac.

25:44.878 --> 25:46.463
- Yeah.

25:46.504 --> 25:49.007
(Beeping continues)

25:49.049 --> 25:50.800
Bob: Get his heart beat.

25:50.842 --> 25:52.802
- Yeah, right there.
- Okay.

25:52.844 --> 25:55.263
(Beeping continues)

25:57.307 --> 25:58.266
- He survived as long
as he did out there

25:58.308 --> 25:59.351
before we found him.

25:59.392 --> 26:00.852
He's a fighter.

26:00.894 --> 26:03.605
(Beeping continues)
Bingo!

26:04.898 --> 26:06.191
- There you go, boy.
You're gonna make it.

26:06.232 --> 26:09.235
- That should be it.
(Beeping stops)

26:09.277 --> 26:11.905
- I got it.

26:11.946 --> 26:14.282
All right.

26:14.324 --> 26:15.408
Nice work.

26:15.450 --> 26:17.285
- Good job.

26:20.330 --> 26:23.833
(Horse snorts, hooves thud)

26:23.875 --> 26:25.293
- Well, I'll have Scott check
him out but fully,

26:25.335 --> 26:28.463
but I'm not seeing any signs
of injury.

26:28.505 --> 26:30.256
- He looks pretty stiff.

26:30.298 --> 26:31.549
- Well, I'm sure he has
a few pretty bad bruises

26:31.591 --> 26:33.760
after a wreck like that.
(Horse whinnies)

26:33.802 --> 26:36.179
He's pretty worked up.
- Yeah.

26:36.221 --> 26:37.263
(Horse whinnies sharply)

26:37.305 --> 26:39.391
- He's way worse than
he was at the clinic.

26:39.432 --> 26:42.018
- Well, it's gonna take a lot
of time to be able trust again

26:42.060 --> 26:44.979
after being trapped
in that trailer.

26:45.021 --> 26:46.731
- Not to mention being
abandoned.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.066
(Horse snorts)

26:48.108 --> 26:49.317
- Hey, boy. Hey.

26:50.527 --> 26:51.695
(Clicks tongue)

26:51.736 --> 26:53.321
You're okay.

26:53.363 --> 26:55.949
All right. Just relax.

26:57.367 --> 26:59.369
(Horse snorts distressed)

26:59.411 --> 27:02.956
(Hooves thud erratically)
(Horse whinnies)

27:04.249 --> 27:06.126
(Horse whinnies)

27:06.167 --> 27:08.837
(Hooves thud erratically)

27:08.878 --> 27:10.755
Do wanna come give it a try,
Georgie?

27:10.797 --> 27:12.090
- Yeah, sure.

27:12.132 --> 27:14.175
(Horse whinnies sharply)

27:15.969 --> 27:18.346
- Go easy.

27:18.388 --> 27:20.265
(Horse whinnies sharply)
- Hey, bud.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.684
(Horse whinnies sharply)
Whoa.

27:24.060 --> 27:25.437
- Georgie had quite
the connection with him

27:25.478 --> 27:26.771
at the clinic.

27:26.813 --> 27:28.189
- Whoa.

27:29.816 --> 27:31.943
Good boy!

27:31.985 --> 27:34.029
Amy: Okay, clip him up.

27:34.070 --> 27:35.905
Let's see how he responds
to pressure.

27:35.947 --> 27:38.450
Just put your hand on his chest
and move him back.

27:38.491 --> 27:40.535
- Shh.

27:40.577 --> 27:43.246
(Clicks her tongue slowly)

27:43.288 --> 27:44.956
Good boy, hoo.

27:44.998 --> 27:47.334
- Okay, now his left shoulder.

27:47.375 --> 27:48.877
It's like how you had me work
with Maverick.

27:48.918 --> 27:50.337
- Yeah.

27:52.088 --> 27:54.424
- (Clicks tongue)

27:54.466 --> 27:56.509
Hoo.

27:56.551 --> 27:58.136
- That's it.

27:58.178 --> 28:00.305
Okay, well, why don't you try
lunging him?

28:00.347 --> 28:02.140
(Clip clicks)

28:03.266 --> 28:05.393
(Chain rattles)

28:05.435 --> 28:08.146
- (Clicks tongue)
(Horse snorts)

28:09.981 --> 28:12.192
(Clicks tongue)
(Hooves thud)

28:13.276 --> 28:14.235
(Clicks tongue)

28:14.277 --> 28:15.862
Good boy!

28:15.904 --> 28:18.531
(Clicks tongue)
(Horse snorts)

28:18.573 --> 28:19.949
(Clicks tongue)
Amy: That's it.

28:19.991 --> 28:22.369
Use your body language
to push him out.

28:22.410 --> 28:25.288
- (Clicks tongue)

28:25.330 --> 28:27.499
(Clicks tongue)

28:27.540 --> 28:29.584
(Horse snorts)
(Clicks tongue)

28:29.626 --> 28:32.587
(Clicks tongue)

28:32.629 --> 28:34.506
(Hooves thud smoothly)

28:34.547 --> 28:38.009
(Clicks tongue)

28:39.177 --> 28:41.054
Ho. Ho.

28:46.393 --> 28:48.103
Ho...

28:50.522 --> 28:52.273
Good boy...

28:54.901 --> 28:56.236
(Horse snorts sharply)

28:56.277 --> 28:57.278
- (Sighs)

28:57.320 --> 29:00.281
That's okay.
He'll come around.

29:00.323 --> 29:02.742
He's already got a lot more
trust than he did.

29:02.784 --> 29:05.829
- Do you think that crazy lady
will come back for him?

29:05.870 --> 29:07.997
- It's hard to say.

29:08.039 --> 29:09.082
Who knows what was going
through her mind

29:09.124 --> 29:10.709
when she left him.

29:10.750 --> 29:14.004
- If she does, would you let
her have him?

29:14.045 --> 29:15.338
- She'd have to be awfully
convincing

29:15.380 --> 29:18.091
for that to happen, Georgie.

29:18.133 --> 29:19.676
Georgie: If I were him
I'd hate it if she came back.

29:19.718 --> 29:22.095
Being cooped up in a stall
all the time?

29:22.137 --> 29:26.057
Not being able to run with
any of the horses?

29:26.099 --> 29:27.225
I'd run away before
I'd let her have

29:27.267 --> 29:28.685
anything to do with me.

29:28.727 --> 29:32.105
- Well, I know you would.
(Laughs)

29:32.147 --> 29:34.232
- Woo boy.

29:34.274 --> 29:36.067
Stand.

29:36.109 --> 29:37.819
Hey, Dad!

29:44.951 --> 29:45.910
Good boy. Ho.

29:48.538 --> 29:51.166
Good boy!

29:51.207 --> 29:52.667
Good boy.

29:52.709 --> 29:54.461
Katie: Daddy, we're making
you a birthday dinner!

29:54.502 --> 29:57.547
- Shh, Katie!
- Sorry!

29:57.589 --> 29:59.632
(Hushed) It's a surprise. Shh!
- I won't tell.

29:59.674 --> 30:02.052
Mitch: So I was thinkin'
if crazy lady doesn't show up

30:02.093 --> 30:03.636
I just might take this guy on,

30:03.678 --> 30:05.180
you know, with the help of you
and Georgie of course,

30:05.221 --> 30:07.432
but Maverick could really
use a buddy.

30:07.474 --> 30:09.059
(Bottles clank)

30:09.100 --> 30:10.518
- Uh, hey!
- Hey.

30:11.811 --> 30:14.522
- Did you, uh, see the horse
out there?

30:14.564 --> 30:17.484
- Yeah, Amy told me about that.
It's so sad.

30:17.525 --> 30:19.319
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:19.361 --> 30:20.653
Listen, I never said
thank you,

30:20.695 --> 30:23.156
thank you so much for bringing
everybody back.

30:23.198 --> 30:25.450
- Oh, no worries.

30:25.492 --> 30:26.951
Katie: It's daddy's birthday
dinner.

30:26.993 --> 30:28.661
Can Mitch come, Mommy?

30:28.703 --> 30:31.122
- Oh, hey, come on,
it's a family thing.

30:31.164 --> 30:33.667
- You're family.

30:33.708 --> 30:36.628
- Uh, I think I'm gonna have to
take another rain check, kiddo.

30:36.670 --> 30:38.546
- What's that even mean?

30:39.881 --> 30:41.758
- All right, okay, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna head out.

30:41.800 --> 30:43.593
Uh, Amy, you let me know what
you think about that idea.

30:43.635 --> 30:47.138
- Yeah, I will.
It could be a good plan.

30:47.180 --> 30:48.306
- Uh, Peter...

30:48.348 --> 30:49.641
happy birthday.

30:49.683 --> 30:52.560
- Thanks.

30:52.602 --> 30:54.604
- Hey, Mitch, um,
can I get your help

30:54.646 --> 30:55.480
moving that horse
to the back pen?

30:55.522 --> 30:57.315
I just want him to have
some more space.

30:57.357 --> 30:58.483
- Sure.
- Okay.

30:58.525 --> 31:00.068
- Can I go too, Mommy?

31:00.110 --> 31:01.653
- Uh, sure, honey.

31:01.695 --> 31:04.948
- (Playful grunt)

31:04.989 --> 31:06.324
Wait for me!

31:08.535 --> 31:11.162
(Door opens and shuts)

31:12.622 --> 31:14.332
(Envelope rustles)

31:15.375 --> 31:23.800
**

31:23.842 --> 31:26.261
- We should do this.

31:27.637 --> 31:29.597
Now, I think.

31:33.476 --> 31:36.021
We both need to move on.

31:36.062 --> 31:38.273
Right?

31:38.314 --> 31:42.694
I think the only way that
either of us can move on is...

31:42.736 --> 31:45.196
is to just get this over with.

31:46.239 --> 31:48.575
(Sighs)

31:48.616 --> 31:50.243
Trust me,
if there was anything good

31:50.285 --> 31:54.539
about my last divorce
is that I closed that door

31:54.581 --> 31:56.416
and then another one opened
when I met you.

31:56.458 --> 31:58.418
- Peter, this is different.

31:58.460 --> 32:00.378
You didn't have kids
with your last wife.

32:00.420 --> 32:03.423
We're parents, and this door
has to always be open.

32:03.465 --> 32:05.508
- It will.

32:05.550 --> 32:08.553
It will. I promise you.

32:08.595 --> 32:15.352
**

32:15.393 --> 32:16.478
Hey.

32:17.896 --> 32:19.731
We're gonna be okay.

32:19.773 --> 32:30.658
**

32:30.700 --> 32:33.286
(Papers rustle)

32:37.624 --> 32:40.043
(Papers rustle)

32:40.085 --> 32:50.095
**

32:50.095 --> 32:55.183
**

33:05.610 --> 33:07.696
(Heart monitor beeps evenly)

33:10.615 --> 33:12.867
- Well, it looks like his blood
pressure's back to normal.

33:12.909 --> 33:14.786
- Oh yeah.

33:14.828 --> 33:16.371
His heart rate's lookin'
better too.

33:16.413 --> 33:18.748
(Spritzing sound)

33:18.790 --> 33:21.626
- So this is what we're here
to do, I guess.

33:21.668 --> 33:23.169
- Yeah, it is.

33:23.211 --> 33:26.256
- That's why we came all this
way in the first place, right?

33:26.297 --> 33:27.549
- It's what I keep
tellin' myself.

33:27.590 --> 33:30.468
(Chuckles)

33:30.510 --> 33:31.970
- I don't know.

33:32.012 --> 33:34.681
If only we could find out who
shot the mother and the cub,

33:34.723 --> 33:36.099
I'd feel a whole lot better.

33:36.141 --> 33:38.309
- Yeah.

33:38.351 --> 33:39.728
Maybe we can.

33:43.940 --> 33:45.734
(Knock at the door)

33:45.775 --> 33:49.237
- Come in.
(Door opens)

33:52.449 --> 33:54.034
- (Chuckles)

33:54.075 --> 33:57.579
Wow. Give me time to get used
to you growing up, okay?

33:59.456 --> 34:00.498
You got a second to talk?

34:00.540 --> 34:02.584
- Yeah, sure.

34:05.587 --> 34:07.422
- So uh...

34:09.882 --> 34:13.344
your Mom and I signed
the divorce papers.

34:16.806 --> 34:18.600
- O-okay.

34:19.809 --> 34:23.605
So... what now?

34:23.646 --> 34:26.524
- Oh, well, nothin's gonna
be different really.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.860
I mean, I'll still be around
all the time,

34:28.902 --> 34:33.322
and probably even more
so now that mom's away, so.

34:33.364 --> 34:34.866
If that's good with you.

34:34.908 --> 34:37.202
- Yeah. Yeah, of course.

34:38.786 --> 34:41.790
- Well, I'm glad you feel
that way.

34:41.831 --> 34:43.625
- Why wouldn't I?

34:45.251 --> 34:46.795
(Small chuckle)

34:51.507 --> 34:53.592
(Chuckles)

34:53.635 --> 34:55.553
(Relieved exhale)

34:55.594 --> 34:57.555
(Camels snort)

34:59.599 --> 35:01.851
- Okay. What's your name?

35:01.893 --> 35:03.770
- Batashte.

35:04.771 --> 35:06.731
Bata.

35:06.773 --> 35:08.775
- Bata?

35:08.817 --> 35:10.694
Okay, Bata.

35:10.735 --> 35:12.821
The cub is gonna live.

35:12.862 --> 35:14.823
So thank you for helping
us find him.

35:14.864 --> 35:16.866
Now we get reward?

35:16.908 --> 35:19.869
First, I need you to help
me out a little more.

35:19.911 --> 35:21.371
Did you happen to see
who the poachers were

35:21.413 --> 35:22.872
before you scared them off?

35:22.914 --> 35:25.417
(Goats bleat)

35:28.545 --> 35:30.422
Could you identify them?

35:32.298 --> 35:33.758
Is this the guy?

35:33.800 --> 35:36.761
- (Speaks in Mongolian)

35:36.803 --> 35:37.929
- (Speaks in Mongolian)

35:37.971 --> 35:39.597
- Wh-hey, hey, hey, hey!

35:39.639 --> 35:41.683
- (Speaks in Mongolian)

35:42.976 --> 35:44.686
- Where are they going?

35:44.728 --> 35:46.938
- They're afraid,

35:46.980 --> 35:49.899
that there will a, a payback.

35:49.941 --> 35:52.610
They all have families
to protect

35:52.652 --> 35:55.530
and the year's been hard enough.

35:57.907 --> 36:00.827
It's not worth the money.

36:07.167 --> 36:08.877
- Oh, Lou, that meal
was amazing!

36:08.918 --> 36:10.795
I didn't know how hungry I was.

36:10.837 --> 36:12.756
Okay, right, I'm always hungry.

36:12.797 --> 36:14.924
Can't wait for that.

36:14.966 --> 36:16.593
- There's a cake in there,
but it's a...

36:16.634 --> 36:18.136
- Surprise!

36:18.178 --> 36:20.472
- (Chuckles)
- Amy! (claps)

36:20.513 --> 36:22.849
- Wow! What the heck?

36:22.891 --> 36:24.893
- Happy birthday!
Katie: Surprise!

36:24.934 --> 36:26.061
- (Chuckles)

36:26.102 --> 36:29.481
- Look at all those candles!
Don't count them.

36:29.522 --> 36:30.440
Okay, you gonna help me
blow it out?

36:30.482 --> 36:32.901
- Uh huh.
- All right. One, two...

36:32.942 --> 36:35.445
(Exhaling loudly)

36:35.487 --> 36:37.572
- (Laughter)

36:37.614 --> 36:38.698
- (Laughs)

36:38.740 --> 36:39.657
Hey!
(Hands clap)

36:39.699 --> 36:42.660
- Okay, I'm gonna make
a toast here.

36:44.120 --> 36:45.830
Now, Peter, you and I,

36:47.665 --> 36:50.877
we share the same opinion about
birthdays,

36:50.919 --> 36:53.380
we don't like 'em, but you,

36:55.006 --> 36:57.759
you're still way too young
to feel that way, so,

36:59.719 --> 37:02.764
I guess you better just enjoy
the day and the moment.

37:04.599 --> 37:06.434
Cheers to Peter.
Happy birthday.

37:06.476 --> 37:07.143
Lou: Happy Birthday!
- Cheers.

37:07.185 --> 37:08.186
- Cheers.
(Glasses clink)

37:08.228 --> 37:10.105
Lou: Cheers.
Peter: Thank you, Jack. Cheers.

37:10.146 --> 37:11.564
- Happy Birthday.
(Glasses clink)

37:11.606 --> 37:13.066
- Thank you. Thanks, guys.

37:13.108 --> 37:14.567
Katie: Mommy, is it time
for presents yet?

37:14.609 --> 37:15.610
Can give Daddy his present?

37:15.652 --> 37:17.570
- Yes, you can do it now!

37:17.612 --> 37:18.571
- Present?

37:18.613 --> 37:21.116
- I'm amazed she could
wait this long.

37:21.157 --> 37:22.867
Katie: Da, da, da, da!

37:22.909 --> 37:25.537
- Oh, my gosh!

37:25.578 --> 37:27.622
Oh, ho, ho, lucky me!

37:27.664 --> 37:29.416
(Paper rips)

37:29.457 --> 37:30.625
- She wrapped it herself.

37:30.667 --> 37:33.378
- I wrapped it all by myself.
Mommy did the tape.

37:33.420 --> 37:35.797
- Cool!
(Paper rips)

37:35.839 --> 37:37.465
Should I open it?

37:37.507 --> 37:39.509
(Paper rustles)

37:39.551 --> 37:41.553
- (Chuckles)

37:41.594 --> 37:43.680
- Okay.

37:43.722 --> 37:48.935
**

37:48.977 --> 37:50.061
Katie: That's me,
you and Georgie!

37:50.103 --> 37:52.814
That's you in the middle.

37:58.611 --> 38:01.489
Do you like it?

38:02.991 --> 38:04.826
- Yes, I do.

38:11.207 --> 38:13.710
- GG, tell us the story
about the stones?

38:13.752 --> 38:15.545
Tim: Oh, not that old yarn
again?

38:15.587 --> 38:16.755
- Hey!

38:16.796 --> 38:18.381
- (Laughing) You're back!

38:18.423 --> 38:19.758
Lou: Dad!
- Hey!

38:19.799 --> 38:21.968
- Hi.
- Hi!

38:22.010 --> 38:23.470
- Hi.
(Kiss)

38:24.637 --> 38:26.139
So, look at all of you.

38:26.181 --> 38:27.849
I was near death
and you're celebrating.

38:27.891 --> 38:30.018
- It's, it's Peter's birthday!

38:30.060 --> 38:32.771
- Oh. Happy birthday, General.
- Thank you.

38:32.812 --> 38:34.606
- Come and sit down.
Are you okay?

38:34.647 --> 38:35.899
- Yeah, they finally
listened to me

38:35.940 --> 38:37.567
and let me out
of that hospital.

38:37.609 --> 38:39.235
- Well, where's Casey?
Did she drive you?

38:39.277 --> 38:41.237
- She's ticked off with me.

38:41.279 --> 38:44.616
Apparently my bedside manner
wasn't at its best.

38:44.657 --> 38:45.784
Lou: Oh.

38:45.825 --> 38:47.243
- GG, the story!

38:47.285 --> 38:49.662
Lou: Okay, okay, we will show
you where the stones are.

38:49.704 --> 38:51.081
- Where's my stone?

38:51.122 --> 38:54.501
- Well, Katie,
yours is this one,

38:54.542 --> 38:56.711
and this little one's me,

38:56.753 --> 38:59.506
and this is Ty's,
and this one's GG's.

38:59.547 --> 39:02.217
- And that's Georgie's stone

39:02.258 --> 39:04.761
and that one's mine.

39:04.803 --> 39:07.180
- Why doesn't Daddy
have a stone?

39:07.222 --> 39:09.641
- That is a good question.

39:09.683 --> 39:11.351
- (Grunts)

39:11.393 --> 39:13.645
I guess we just never
got around to it.

39:13.687 --> 39:14.938
- You were supposed to pick one

39:14.979 --> 39:16.773
on our first anniversary,
remember?

39:16.815 --> 39:18.191
Peter: That's right. I guess-

39:18.233 --> 39:20.151
I guess we got caught up
with the wish lanterns.

39:20.193 --> 39:21.403
- Right.

39:21.444 --> 39:24.489
Georgie: I agree with Katie.
Dad needs a stone.

39:24.531 --> 39:25.990
Amy: Absolutely.

39:28.034 --> 39:29.994
- There you go.

39:30.036 --> 39:31.871
(Chuckles)

39:31.913 --> 39:33.248
Wow.

39:33.289 --> 39:35.166
Look at this guy.

39:35.208 --> 39:36.209
It's amazing.

39:36.251 --> 39:38.086
- I told you. He's a total
fighter, man.

39:38.128 --> 39:39.170
Ty: Yeah.

39:39.212 --> 39:40.964
(Goats bleat)

39:41.006 --> 39:43.842
- (Chuckles)

39:43.883 --> 39:46.052
Feels pretty good, doesn't it?

39:46.094 --> 39:48.888
- It sure does.
There's nothin' like it.

39:49.973 --> 39:51.558
Both: (Chuckle)

39:54.561 --> 39:55.729
- Come on, pick a stone!

39:55.770 --> 39:58.064
- Okay, well, um...

39:58.106 --> 39:59.774
- Pick one close to Mommy.

39:59.816 --> 40:02.110
- Yeah? Okay, um...

40:05.155 --> 40:07.574
which one's yours?

40:07.615 --> 40:11.453
- This one.

40:14.414 --> 40:16.875
- How about that one there?
Is that taken?

40:16.916 --> 40:18.626
- Nope.

40:20.920 --> 40:22.797
- Okay.

40:22.839 --> 40:25.050
Well, that's the one then.

40:25.091 --> 40:26.176
- Happy birthday.

40:26.217 --> 40:27.552
- Thank you.

40:27.594 --> 40:29.012
- Happy Birthday.

40:29.054 --> 40:31.181
- Thank you. (Kiss)

40:45.570 --> 40:46.988
Bata.

40:49.157 --> 40:50.742
- That picture...

for somethin' *

40:56.790 --> 40:59.876

Bata: Yes.

41:07.217 --> 41:09.719
Yes.

41:09.761 --> 41:12.138
It was him. The hunter.

41:14.224 --> 41:16.559
- Thank you, Bata.

41:16.601 --> 41:18.520
You're a brave man.

41:18.561 --> 41:22.190
* Baby, nothin' would,
nothin' comes for free *

41:22.232 --> 41:23.358
(Hands clap)

41:23.400 --> 41:25.318
* Baby, nothin' worth nothin'
comes for free *

41:25.360 --> 41:26.986
- Reward?

41:27.028 --> 41:27.737
- (Chuckles)

41:27.779 --> 41:29.114
* And everybody knows it *

41:29.155 --> 41:31.533
- Yeah. Reward.

41:46.297 --> 41:48.550
* If you keep holdin' on *

41:49.843 --> 41:51.720
- That was pretty great.

41:56.683 --> 41:58.226
(Sighs)

41:58.268 --> 41:59.894
Thank you.

42:05.692 --> 42:07.402
(Kiss)

42:07.444 --> 42:09.320
- (Sighs)

42:09.362 --> 42:12.073
- And we will be okay.

42:12.115 --> 42:12.824
- I know.

42:15.493 --> 42:17.787
Katie: Daddy, where are you?

42:17.829 --> 42:20.582
- You're being paged.
- (Chuckles)

42:23.251 --> 42:24.461
Okay, I'm on my way,
Kitty Kat!

* I swear that
there's a reason *

42:56.409 --> 42:58.745

43:00.121 --> 43:01.790
(Computer dialing)

43:04.751 --> 43:06.461
- Hey!

43:06.503 --> 43:08.797
Who is that handsome fella?
Do I know you?

43:10.632 --> 43:12.801
- You wouldn't believe the last
few days that I've had.

43:12.842 --> 43:14.177
- Oh, no you have no idea

43:14.219 --> 43:16.388
what my past few days
have been like!

43:16.429 --> 43:18.932
- Okay, really? You first then.

43:18.973 --> 43:20.558

43:20.600 --> 43:22.352

all the gory details.

43:22.394 --> 43:24.062
They'll probably drive
you crazy.

43:24.104 --> 43:27.399
- Oh, you want gory details?
I've got gory details.

43:27.440 --> 43:29.150
- Okay. Spill, Mister.

43:30.610 --> 43:33.154
- Where do I start? Uh, well...
