WEBVTT

00:03.177 --> 00:04.134
Then it's all true.

00:04.178 --> 00:05.788
God, the Devil.

00:05.830 --> 00:07.833
Now you live in a secret bunker

00:07.877 --> 00:11.228
with an angel and Lucifer's kid.

00:11.272 --> 00:14.101
Dad, none of this would have
happened without you.

00:31.292 --> 00:32.573
This isn't just Michael
we're talking about.

00:32.597 --> 00:34.121
It's Dean.

00:34.164 --> 00:36.601
I can feel him in my head.

00:36.645 --> 00:39.343
Michael gets out,
that's it for this world.

00:41.128 --> 00:44.044
Billie said that there's only
one way that this ends right.

00:44.087 --> 00:45.567
You and Michael,

00:45.610 --> 00:47.395
trapped... for eternity?

00:59.407 --> 01:02.149
Jack?

01:04.367 --> 01:06.288
We need to use magic
that will draw on your soul.

01:07.328 --> 01:10.113
I am a Winchester!

01:11.375 --> 01:12.695
I had to burn off
to kill Michael.

01:14.378 --> 01:16.337
Nick. He's trying
to resurrect Lucifer.

01:16.380 --> 01:17.120
I'm here.

01:17.164 --> 01:18.382
No!

01:21.994 --> 01:24.432
I'm trying to understand
Jack without a soul.

01:24.475 --> 01:26.912
- Listen to me!
- Leave me alone!

01:30.220 --> 01:32.198
I wish I could forget
about him! After what he did?

01:32.222 --> 01:35.095
This is our only play.

01:50.762 --> 01:51.762
Jack.

02:08.431 --> 02:10.259
You lied to me.

02:10.304 --> 02:11.957
Jack.

02:12.001 --> 02:13.437
You lied!

02:23.491 --> 02:26.189
- No!
- No!

02:57.264 --> 03:00.049
I don't understand.

03:02.530 --> 03:06.316
The Ma'lak box can hold
an archangel.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.492
Jack's not an archangel.

03:08.536 --> 03:10.973
Yeah, apparently,
the kid leveled up.

03:11.016 --> 03:13.715
So, what do we do?

03:13.758 --> 03:15.282
We find him. How?

03:15.325 --> 03:16.805
I don't know, Cass. You tell me.

03:16.848 --> 03:18.807
Okay, the last time
we found Jack, it wa...

03:18.850 --> 03:21.984
It was by praying to him, but
that's not gonna happen again.

03:22.027 --> 03:23.812
Yeah, you think?

03:23.855 --> 03:26.118
You should never have tried
to lock him away.

03:26.162 --> 03:27.511
You know what? You're right.

03:27.555 --> 03:29.513
I never wanted to put him
in that damn box.

03:29.557 --> 03:30.993
I wanted him dead.Dean.

03:31.036 --> 03:33.300
He's dangerous, Cass,
and you knew it!

03:33.343 --> 03:35.258
You've known it for a long time!

03:35.302 --> 03:36.912
But that's okay. You know why?

03:36.955 --> 03:38.324
Because me and Sam, we've killed
just about everything there is.

03:38.348 --> 03:41.003
And this... Jack...
We'll find a way.

03:41.046 --> 03:43.092
Because he's just
another monster.

03:43.135 --> 03:45.268
You don't mean that.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.139
The hell I don't.

03:58.890 --> 04:02.067
All right. So, I guess
we got to find Jack.

04:02.111 --> 04:04.809
Yeah. Then what? I don't know.

04:04.853 --> 04:06.333
Maybe we call Rowena,

04:06.376 --> 04:08.291
see if she can put together
one of those, um,

04:08.335 --> 04:09.684
"soul bombs."

04:09.727 --> 04:12.861
The... thing you were gonna use
against the Darkness?

04:12.904 --> 04:15.516
Yeah, might actually
put a dent in the kid.

04:15.559 --> 04:19.563
Okay.

04:19.607 --> 04:21.608
Sam, I know this isn't easy,
okay?

04:21.652 --> 04:24.568
He... I know how much
he meant to you.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.788
He meant a lot to me.
He was family.

04:26.831 --> 04:29.356
But this?
This is not Jack anymore.

04:29.399 --> 04:31.923
He's hurting,
he's killing people.

04:32.707 --> 04:34.361
This isn't gonna be easy,

04:34.404 --> 04:36.537
but we're gonna have to do
the hard thing.

04:36.580 --> 04:39.191
We're gonna have to do
the ugly thing.

04:44.588 --> 04:48.113
Ain't like it's the first time,
though, right?

04:55.425 --> 04:56.687
No, honey, it's not like that.

04:56.731 --> 04:58.428
She's just a friend from work.

04:58.472 --> 05:01.344
You should've seen it.
I caught a steelhead this big.

05:01.388 --> 05:02.650
I mean it.

05:02.693 --> 05:04.608
We went up to the cabin...

05:04.652 --> 05:05.716
My God. She's such a bitch.

05:05.740 --> 05:08.090
Baby, it's not you. It's me.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.877
No, I don't think he
took offense. You're awesome.

05:12.921 --> 05:14.028
Just because Mommy and Daddy
aren't gonna be together,

05:14.052 --> 05:15.619
we still love you.

05:15.663 --> 05:17.229
I saw 'em
at Coachella last year!

05:17.273 --> 05:19.512
- Nothing's gonna change.
- Greatest company to work for.

05:19.536 --> 05:21.384
You won't be I don't have
any problem with those.

05:21.408 --> 05:23.647
- You're my best friend.
- Your, um... profile said 6'1".

05:23.671 --> 05:25.281
I am. Basically.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.477
- You're finally getting a break.
- It's good to see you.

05:27.501 --> 05:29.416
- Come on, baby.
- Why does everyone...

05:29.459 --> 05:31.461
That's not porn.
I-I don't know what that was.

05:31.505 --> 05:33.985
Stop lying!

05:49.523 --> 05:51.046
Yeah, I know
it's a long shot, Rowena,

05:51.089 --> 05:52.656
but just try, okay?

05:52.700 --> 05:54.702
I mean, try.

05:56.007 --> 05:58.270
She in?

05:58.314 --> 06:01.491
She thinks
it's dangerous and insane.

06:01.535 --> 06:03.537
But, yeah, she's in.

06:03.580 --> 06:05.539
Well, she knows
what Jack's capable of.

06:15.505 --> 06:17.202
Excuse me. Coming through.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.559
Nerds. Takes one to know one.

06:25.602 --> 06:27.082
What?

06:27.125 --> 06:29.084
You. Come on, man.

06:29.127 --> 06:30.694
You're always calling me a geek,

06:30.738 --> 06:32.498
but you know every word
to every Led Zeppelin song...

06:32.522 --> 06:33.697
Backwards and forwards...

06:33.741 --> 06:34.916
You can discuss in detail

06:34.959 --> 06:36.787
every major rock drummer
between '67 and '84,

06:36.831 --> 06:40.748
and... you watch "Jeopardy!"
every night.

06:40.791 --> 06:42.489
Okay. All right, yeah.

06:42.532 --> 06:45.753
But I'm nothing like these,
you know, gaggle of Zuckerbergs.

06:45.796 --> 06:47.581
Th-They're not...

06:47.624 --> 06:50.322
Mirror Universe builds
facial-recognition software.

06:50.366 --> 06:52.281
They've got contracts
with... with basically

06:52.324 --> 06:55.066
every law-enforcement agency
on the planet. Okay. So?

06:55.110 --> 06:57.373
So w-we need to track Jack,
but he flies,

06:57.417 --> 06:59.133
so if we can't go ahead and
track his license plate,

06:59.157 --> 07:00.594
maybe we can track his... His face.

07:00.637 --> 07:02.117
His face, exactly.Okay.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.727
I got this.

07:07.601 --> 07:09.472
Can I help you?

07:09.516 --> 07:11.916
Hi. I'm Dean Winchester, and
I'm looking for the devil's son.

07:14.825 --> 07:18.350
- What?
- What?

07:21.397 --> 07:24.052
I meant I'm Dean Winchester,

07:24.095 --> 07:25.053
and I'm looking
for the devil's son.

07:25.096 --> 07:26.620
This badge is fake.

07:34.192 --> 07:36.325
Excuse me.

07:36.368 --> 07:37.648
Hey. I'm sleeping with
your wife.

07:37.674 --> 07:40.851
- I know. Kind of into it.
- What?

07:42.679 --> 07:43.830
Hey, let me ask you a question.

07:43.854 --> 07:45.813
Tell me who
your favorite singer is.

07:45.856 --> 07:47.510
What? You...

07:47.554 --> 07:49.183
Look, I know you say it's Elvis,
but we both know that's crap,

07:49.207 --> 07:50.774
so tell me who
your favorite singer is.

07:50.818 --> 07:52.820
Well, it's like you said.
It's Celine Dion.

07:53.951 --> 07:55.605
I mean Celine Dion.

07:55.649 --> 07:57.607
It's Celi...

07:57.651 --> 07:59.609
Dean, every time I try
and say "Elvis,"

07:59.653 --> 08:01.524
it comes out... The sad, horrible truth.

08:01.568 --> 08:03.657
Yeah. You know why?
Because we can't lie.

08:03.700 --> 08:07.399
All right! Who ate my yogurt?!

08:07.443 --> 08:10.664
Right here! I knew it was you!

08:10.707 --> 08:13.667
That was the third...
Son of a bitch! No!

08:13.710 --> 08:15.103
Guess we're not the only ones.

08:15.146 --> 08:18.454
Double?! You make double?

08:18.498 --> 08:21.413
And that was my parking space!

08:21.457 --> 08:23.154
I hate everyone!

08:23.198 --> 08:25.809
I can't believe you taped it!
I thought it was hot!

08:28.899 --> 08:30.466
Let's go.

08:36.385 --> 08:38.735
In what was supposed to be
a speech on farming subsidies,

08:38.779 --> 08:41.520
the President instead
spent more than two hours

08:41.563 --> 08:43.740
disclosing his entire
tax history,

08:43.784 --> 08:46.177
deep ties to Russia
and North Korea,

08:46.221 --> 08:47.918
and a quote "demon deal"

08:47.962 --> 08:49.746
he made
with someone named Crowley.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.879
Dude. What the hell? Over to you, Jack.

08:51.922 --> 08:53.881
Did we just walk into a case?

08:56.971 --> 08:59.277
Jack? I love you.

08:59.321 --> 09:01.758
I'vealways loved you.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.960
Pundits on both sides
of the aisle...

09:09.984 --> 09:11.942
Okay, Dean.

09:11.986 --> 09:13.727
I think whatever
is happening here,

09:13.770 --> 09:16.425
i-it's not just happening here.

09:16.468 --> 09:19.167
Yeah, no, it's... it's
everywhere, but what...

09:19.210 --> 09:20.298
Jack.

09:21.822 --> 09:24.738
Son of a bitch.

09:24.781 --> 09:27.305
I hate everyone!

09:27.349 --> 09:30.961
Like right now.

09:31.005 --> 09:33.964
- I hate this!
- I am the stapler queen.

09:34.008 --> 09:36.967
I am the stapler queen.

09:37.011 --> 09:39.666
I am the stapler queen!

09:39.709 --> 09:41.929
I need to go to hell.

09:41.972 --> 09:44.714
You mean, like,
metaphorically or...

09:44.758 --> 09:46.324
No. Literally.

09:46.368 --> 09:48.979
And I understand
you can take me.

09:49.023 --> 09:50.372
Really?

09:50.415 --> 09:52.940
'Cause from what I remember,
you've been to hell...

09:52.983 --> 09:55.769
More than once.

09:55.812 --> 09:57.509
Well, this... it's different.

09:57.553 --> 10:00.774
I need time to see the Cage
and study it.

10:00.817 --> 10:02.253
Yeah, that's a no.

10:02.297 --> 10:05.343
So you can go to hell...
Metaphorically.

10:05.387 --> 10:07.258
No, don't.

10:07.302 --> 10:10.305
Wow. Yeah.

10:10.348 --> 10:11.959
You guys are screwed.

10:27.801 --> 10:30.630
Hello. Hi.

10:30.673 --> 10:32.806
I'm Jack. I remember.

10:32.849 --> 10:34.546
Well, good.

10:37.680 --> 10:41.031
God...

10:41.075 --> 10:44.600
Chuck. There you go.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.820
Is it really...

10:46.863 --> 10:49.344
How are You here?

10:49.387 --> 10:51.302
You called me?

10:51.346 --> 10:52.869
God...

10:52.913 --> 10:56.264
I don't know where you are.
I don't know if you can hear me.

10:56.307 --> 10:57.874
But please.

10:57.918 --> 11:01.051
Sam, Dean... we need you.

11:03.053 --> 11:04.838
My prayer?
That's why you're here.

11:04.881 --> 11:08.624
Yeah. Well, that and... him.

11:10.887 --> 11:12.846
Jack.

11:12.889 --> 11:14.804
He's a problem.

11:18.634 --> 11:22.116
I don't mean to bother you,
but we talked before,

11:22.159 --> 11:24.335
and I liked that talk,

11:24.379 --> 11:26.381
and I thought we could just

11:26.424 --> 11:28.905
maybe talk again...

11:28.949 --> 11:30.907
maybe about your daughter.

11:33.867 --> 11:36.043
No.

11:37.609 --> 11:38.959
I don't understand.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.832
You lied to us.

11:44.965 --> 11:48.098
You said you worked with Kelly,
but after you left,

11:48.142 --> 11:51.580
my husband and I,
we made some calls,

11:51.623 --> 11:54.888
and no one knows who you are.

11:54.931 --> 11:56.803
I...

11:56.846 --> 11:58.065
I didn't.

11:58.108 --> 12:01.155
Yes, you did.

12:01.198 --> 12:03.418
Kelly's not away
on some "secret mission."

12:03.461 --> 12:04.941
She...

12:09.163 --> 12:11.905
They think she's dead.

12:15.212 --> 12:17.780
What did you do to my daughter?!

12:20.304 --> 12:22.698
What did you do?!

12:22.742 --> 12:25.135
Stop!

12:31.011 --> 12:33.230
When people can't lie,
the Internet gets real quiet.

12:39.236 --> 12:41.673
Yeah, guess your life
isn't so perfect after all,

12:41.717 --> 12:43.153
EightPackMommy.

12:43.197 --> 12:45.895
- What?
- Yeah, she's got this blog.

12:45.939 --> 12:47.941
Yeah, you know what?
Your kids aren't that cute.

12:47.984 --> 12:49.812
And that gluten-free popover
looks like crap

12:49.856 --> 12:51.007
because there's no gluten in it.

12:51.031 --> 12:52.467
You know what I mean?

12:54.251 --> 12:56.166
I'll stop talking. Probably a good plan.

12:59.082 --> 13:02.259
You're losing your mind
over one yogurt!

13:02.303 --> 13:05.175
It was threeyogurts!

13:05.219 --> 13:07.438
I hate everyone!

13:07.482 --> 13:09.223
I hate everyone!

13:09.266 --> 13:12.443
- I just want to be loved.
- I hate everyone!

13:12.487 --> 13:15.229
I hate everyone! I just want a sweet life.

13:15.272 --> 13:17.057
I hate everyone!

13:17.100 --> 13:19.339
You see, this is why
people need to lie. I hate everyone!

13:19.363 --> 13:22.758
It's good.
Keeps the peace, you know?

13:22.802 --> 13:25.195
I hate everyone!

13:25.239 --> 13:28.024
Seems like an odd stance
for... you. I hate everyone!

13:28.068 --> 13:29.983
Is it?

13:30.026 --> 13:31.071
I'm a writer.

13:31.114 --> 13:32.986
Lying's kind of what we do.

13:33.029 --> 13:34.485
- I just want to be loved!
- I hate everyone!

13:34.509 --> 13:38.034
Sam! I hate everyone!

13:38.078 --> 13:40.820
Dean! I hate every...

13:40.863 --> 13:42.734
Cass?

13:42.778 --> 13:44.867
Cass. How'd you get here?

13:44.911 --> 13:46.869
He brought me. Hey, guys.

13:56.661 --> 13:58.098
I know what you're thinking...

13:58.141 --> 14:02.232
It's been awhile,
and I still look pretty good.

14:02.276 --> 14:05.018
No, that's... that's not
what we were thinking.

14:05.061 --> 14:06.323
Where the hell have you been?

14:06.367 --> 14:08.282
Well, you know,
it's a funny story.

14:08.325 --> 14:11.241
It reminds me of a song.

14:17.552 --> 14:19.249
Answer the damn question!

14:19.293 --> 14:20.860
Don't!

14:27.170 --> 14:29.346
It's a little cramped in here,
don't you think?

14:31.174 --> 14:33.394
There. That's better.

14:36.832 --> 14:39.313
So... how's things?

14:42.185 --> 14:44.318
Okay, look. I get it.

14:44.361 --> 14:46.276
All right, I'm from
the deus from the machina,

14:46.320 --> 14:47.364
and you have questions.

14:47.408 --> 14:49.889
So, great. Go.

14:49.932 --> 14:52.892
Yeah, like Dean said,
where have you been?

14:52.935 --> 14:55.329
It's hard to explain.

14:55.372 --> 14:58.114
Um... everywhere and nowhere,

14:58.158 --> 15:02.684
to the edge of the universe
and beyond.

15:02.727 --> 15:06.296
And I saw Springsteen
on Broadway. Man's a genius.

15:06.340 --> 15:08.037
What about Amara?

15:08.081 --> 15:09.430
She's been with me.

15:09.473 --> 15:11.432
Yeah, it's been nice
reconnecting after the whole

15:11.475 --> 15:14.043
"trying to murder me
and end all existence" thing.

15:14.087 --> 15:16.132
- Where is she now?
- Reno.

15:16.176 --> 15:17.133
Turns out she loves kino.

15:17.177 --> 15:19.048
And you're here because...

15:19.092 --> 15:20.180
Because of Jack.

15:22.182 --> 15:24.358
Listen, you guys know me.
I'm hands-off.

15:24.401 --> 15:26.708
I built the sandbox...
You play in it.

15:26.751 --> 15:28.623
You want to fight Leviathans?

15:28.666 --> 15:30.364
Cool. You got that.

15:30.407 --> 15:31.428
You want to go up against...
What was it?

15:31.452 --> 15:32.975
The "British Men of Letters"?

15:33.019 --> 15:35.195
Okay. Little weak, but okay.

15:35.238 --> 15:38.241
But when things get really bad,

15:38.285 --> 15:41.375
like the Apocalypse
or the Other Apocalypse,

15:41.418 --> 15:43.681
that's when I have to step in.

15:43.725 --> 15:46.641
So You're saying Jack
is Apocalyptic?

15:46.684 --> 15:48.967
The kid said, "Stop lying,"
and I don't know if you noticed,

15:48.991 --> 15:52.255
but the world kinda went insane.

15:54.518 --> 15:56.433
Rioting in the streets

15:56.477 --> 15:58.435
as the Dow drops
nearly 15,000 points.

16:12.058 --> 16:13.494
And it's been confirmed...

16:13.537 --> 16:16.453
The Queen of England is,
in fact, a lizard.

16:16.497 --> 16:17.497
Inside...

16:19.065 --> 16:20.283
See?

16:20.327 --> 16:22.024
Can you fix it?

16:23.460 --> 16:25.419
Fine.

16:27.334 --> 16:28.334
Fixed.

16:30.337 --> 16:33.035
- Really?
- I'm God, Sam.

16:33.079 --> 16:34.994
Yeah, really.

16:35.037 --> 16:37.997
Go ahead. Try it out.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.042
Celine Dion rocks.

16:42.262 --> 16:45.526
Yeah. Yeah, we can lie again.

16:45.569 --> 16:47.310
And the rioting?

16:47.354 --> 16:50.052
Like it never happened.

16:50.096 --> 16:52.794
Hey! Who ate my yogurt?!

17:00.497 --> 17:02.499
Dicks.

17:07.329 --> 17:09.376
You're welcome.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.511
Look, the point is

17:14.555 --> 17:16.512
the kid did all that
with two words.

17:16.557 --> 17:19.516
What's next? He sneezes and...
Whoops... there goes India?

17:19.560 --> 17:21.605
I don't know. Maybe.

17:21.648 --> 17:25.521
But this is bad...
Like Me Level Bad.

17:25.566 --> 17:27.523
Can you stop him?

17:27.568 --> 17:29.874
Not exactly.

17:29.918 --> 17:31.267
But you can.

17:34.270 --> 17:35.532
With that.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.376
What is that?

17:53.420 --> 17:55.552
I'm thinking of calling it...

17:55.596 --> 17:57.337
the Equalizer!

17:59.948 --> 18:01.558
Or...

18:01.602 --> 18:03.952
the Hammurabi.

18:08.435 --> 18:10.437
No?

18:13.309 --> 18:15.050
All right, cool.
That's cool. Cool.

18:15.094 --> 18:18.140
Wait, y-you're saying that
this thing could kill Jack?

18:18.184 --> 18:19.924
That? That'll kill anything.

18:19.968 --> 18:21.380
So you've had this
the whole time and...

18:21.404 --> 18:22.555
And we're just now getting it?

18:22.579 --> 18:24.625
- Why?
- Because I haven't?

18:24.668 --> 18:26.801
- Y...
- I just made that sucker.

18:26.844 --> 18:29.369
Hasn't been fired yet.

18:29.412 --> 18:32.154
So you don't even know
if it works.

18:32.198 --> 18:34.287
If I say it'll work, it'll work.

18:34.330 --> 18:35.679
There's no bullets.

18:35.723 --> 18:38.378
Right, it doesn't exactly
use bullets.

18:40.902 --> 18:43.426
See, existence is
all about balance, right?

18:43.470 --> 18:47.082
Dark and light, good and evil,
chocolate and peanut butter.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.605
Yeah, okay, Chuck.

18:48.649 --> 18:50.390
- The point, please?
- Right.

18:50.433 --> 18:53.915
So, this doesn't so much
fire bullets as it sends

18:53.958 --> 18:55.395
a wave of multi-dimensional
energy

18:55.438 --> 18:57.614
across a perfectly balanced
quantum link

18:57.658 --> 19:00.704
between whoever's shooting it
and whoever they're shooting at.

19:07.537 --> 19:09.365
What?

19:10.932 --> 19:13.630
Whatever happens to
the person you're aiming at

19:13.674 --> 19:15.632
also happens to you.

19:15.676 --> 19:17.678
So you kill him...

19:17.721 --> 19:19.419
You die.

19:21.551 --> 19:24.641
Right. Yeah.

19:25.729 --> 19:27.688
Look, I know it's not perfect,

19:27.731 --> 19:29.777
and I'd do it myself,
but, you know, if I bite it,

19:29.820 --> 19:32.736
then... existence
also kind of bites it,

19:32.780 --> 19:35.043
so one of you...

19:35.086 --> 19:36.697
Sorry.

19:36.740 --> 19:40.788
I don't understand why we're
talking about killing Jack.

19:40.831 --> 19:42.224
Y-You can fix him.

19:42.268 --> 19:44.008
You can...
You can restore his soul.

19:44.052 --> 19:45.445
That's why I called you.

19:45.488 --> 19:47.708
Yeah, not so much.

19:47.751 --> 19:49.666
You're God.

19:49.710 --> 19:54.410
Well, souls are complicated...
Even for me.

19:54.454 --> 19:57.239
Besides, even if I could,
would you really want...

19:57.283 --> 20:00.503
I mean, after what he did?

20:00.547 --> 20:02.244
Then we bind him.

20:02.288 --> 20:04.551
We throw him
in the Cage until...

20:04.594 --> 20:06.727
Stop, Cass.

20:07.771 --> 20:09.773
You heard him.

20:09.817 --> 20:11.558
This is the only way.

20:11.601 --> 20:14.561
And Billie said
the only way to defeat Michael

20:14.604 --> 20:16.258
was to lock youin a box.

20:16.302 --> 20:17.825
Billie.

20:17.868 --> 20:19.696
I liked the old Death better.

20:19.740 --> 20:22.438
He was all about fried pickles
and tickle porn.

20:22.482 --> 20:23.918
This new Death...

20:23.961 --> 20:27.574
She's always sticking her scythe
where it doesn't belong.

20:27.617 --> 20:29.053
There has to be another way.

20:29.097 --> 20:30.751
Well, there's not.

20:30.794 --> 20:33.710
Now, I know you don't like it,
and I don't really care.

20:33.754 --> 20:35.582
'Cause you just heard it
from God Himself

20:35.625 --> 20:38.541
that this is the only thing
that can kill Jack,

20:38.585 --> 20:41.544
so either get on board,
or walk away.

21:00.346 --> 21:02.783
What did you do to my daughter?!

21:02.826 --> 21:04.785
What did you do?!

21:04.828 --> 21:06.308
Stop!

21:13.402 --> 21:16.623
Dean? Yeah. Over here.

21:16.666 --> 21:18.320
Hey. Good, I'm glad you're here.

21:18.364 --> 21:19.645
I actually needed to
talk to you about something.

21:19.669 --> 21:21.802
Um...

21:21.845 --> 21:23.630
Have a seat.

21:26.676 --> 21:28.330
Yeah.

21:31.594 --> 21:35.642
What's going on?

21:35.685 --> 21:36.599
You know what I'm gonna say.

21:36.643 --> 21:38.514
Let me guess.

21:38.558 --> 21:42.910
This is where you tell me
you're gonna pull the trigger?

21:42.953 --> 21:44.651
Yeah, it is.

21:47.131 --> 21:49.917
We don't have a choice, Sam.

21:49.960 --> 21:53.137
Of course we do.
Don't we always?

21:53.181 --> 21:55.792
I mean, isn't that the point
of everything we've ever done,

21:55.836 --> 21:58.055
that we always have a choice?

21:58.099 --> 21:59.796
He killed our mom.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.929
I get it. I was mad, too.
Or you know what?

22:01.972 --> 22:04.105
Hell, I'm still mad.

22:04.148 --> 22:07.151
And a part of me wants Jack
dead... it really does.

22:07.195 --> 22:10.372
But, Dean, we haven't even
tried to save him.

22:10.416 --> 22:12.635
S... Okay.

22:12.679 --> 22:14.637
You heard him, right?

22:14.681 --> 22:16.857
He actually blamed Mom
for what happened.

22:16.900 --> 22:19.425
He doesn't have a soul.

22:19.468 --> 22:21.644
And whose fault is that?

22:21.688 --> 22:22.950
Mine.

22:22.993 --> 22:24.691
I'm the one
who brought him back,

22:24.734 --> 22:27.389
and I brought him back
because he's family.

22:27.433 --> 22:28.956
Okay.

22:28.999 --> 22:30.610
And then he came back,

22:30.653 --> 22:33.743
and he burned his soul off
to save us...

22:33.787 --> 22:36.224
You and me.

22:36.267 --> 22:38.661
And now what? You...

22:38.705 --> 22:40.184
Now you...
You want my permission?

22:42.056 --> 22:43.927
You want me to say I'm cool

22:43.971 --> 22:46.974
with losing him
and losing you all at once?

22:49.933 --> 22:52.980
'Cause I can't do that.

22:53.023 --> 22:55.461
I won't say that, 'cause I...

22:57.811 --> 23:01.989
No.

23:02.032 --> 23:04.948
I've already lost too much.

23:44.814 --> 23:46.729
Jack.

23:49.384 --> 23:51.560
I've been looking for you.

24:04.573 --> 24:07.054
I haven't seen one of these
in forever.

24:07.097 --> 24:09.099
Where'd you get it?

24:10.274 --> 24:11.798
Another world.

24:11.841 --> 24:14.365
Right.

24:20.894 --> 24:24.027
So...

24:24.071 --> 24:25.812
How many are there...

24:25.855 --> 24:28.815
How many other worlds
or... or universes

24:28.858 --> 24:30.817
or realities or whatever?

24:30.860 --> 24:32.079
I don't know.

24:32.122 --> 24:33.863
Kinda lost count.

24:33.907 --> 24:35.865
Most of them are boring.

24:35.909 --> 24:37.301
One's in reverse.

24:37.345 --> 24:39.521
In one, there's no yellow.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.828
One... One
of them's just all squirrels.

24:44.874 --> 24:48.138
So, Michael said that
you create these worlds

24:48.182 --> 24:51.533
and you just toss them away

24:51.577 --> 24:53.883
like failed versions
of some book.

24:56.582 --> 24:59.106
And you believe him?

24:59.149 --> 25:01.412
Was he lying?

25:03.937 --> 25:06.287
Is that what you're doing to us?

25:06.330 --> 25:09.116
No. Sam...

25:09.159 --> 25:11.074
you and your brother,

25:11.118 --> 25:13.294
of all the Sams and Deans
in all the multiverse,

25:13.337 --> 25:14.817
you're my favorite.

25:14.861 --> 25:16.906
You're just so interesting.

25:16.950 --> 25:18.841
I mean, like that thing
that happened at the office

25:18.865 --> 25:21.215
earlier today...
That was crazy, right?

25:24.914 --> 25:27.090
And I thought I could
make the world a better place

25:27.134 --> 25:29.353
if people couldn't lie.

25:29.397 --> 25:32.792
Well, it didn't.It really didn't.

25:32.835 --> 25:35.925
And I went to see
my grandparents.

25:35.969 --> 25:37.100
The Klines.

25:37.144 --> 25:39.059
Yeah, I thought they liked me.

25:39.102 --> 25:40.669
Maybe they'd still like me.

25:40.713 --> 25:41.975
And?

25:42.018 --> 25:45.935
My grandmother said
I killed her... my mom.

25:45.979 --> 25:47.458
And I did.

25:47.502 --> 25:49.112
Just by being born.

25:49.156 --> 25:52.072
Jack...

25:52.115 --> 25:54.683
I used to hate myself for it.

25:54.727 --> 25:56.946
But I don't
feel that way anymore.

26:03.649 --> 26:05.912
I don't feel anything.

26:07.174 --> 26:09.785
After she said that,
what did you do?

26:11.047 --> 26:13.180
I just...

26:13.223 --> 26:14.181
What did you do?!

26:14.224 --> 26:16.139
Stop!

26:18.185 --> 26:22.015
Just stop.

26:22.058 --> 26:23.407
What?

26:23.451 --> 26:25.148
What are you?!

26:46.213 --> 26:47.606
I ran.

26:49.216 --> 26:51.218
Do you watch us?

26:51.261 --> 26:54.003
When you're not here,
are... are you...

26:54.047 --> 26:55.614
watching us?

26:58.355 --> 27:00.227
Yeah.

27:01.271 --> 27:03.186
I mean, you're my favorite show.

27:03.230 --> 27:05.754
Then why don't you do something?

27:05.798 --> 27:07.016
If I had your power...

27:07.060 --> 27:08.757
Sam.

27:08.801 --> 27:10.803
We talked about this.

27:10.846 --> 27:12.935
Not the way it works.

27:12.979 --> 27:15.242
Wait a second.

27:15.285 --> 27:19.942
Why, when the chips are down,
when the world is... is failing,

27:19.986 --> 27:22.031
why does it always
have to be on us?!

27:22.075 --> 27:24.077
Because you're my guys.

27:26.296 --> 27:29.735
But right now,
we need to focus on Jack.

27:29.778 --> 27:31.040
That kid.

27:37.873 --> 27:39.614
Wait a second.

27:39.658 --> 27:42.095
You're scared of him.

27:42.138 --> 27:44.793
Aren't you?

27:47.666 --> 27:50.059
Do you know where he is?

27:50.103 --> 27:52.105
I do.

27:52.148 --> 27:54.237
Then what are you waiting for?

27:54.281 --> 27:56.065
Nothing.

27:56.109 --> 27:57.893
Dean's already gone.

27:59.765 --> 28:02.332
Mary was a mistake.

28:02.376 --> 28:06.249
But ever since then, I've tried
to do the right thing...

28:06.293 --> 28:07.250
Except for Dumah.

28:07.294 --> 28:09.644
She, um... She led you astray.

28:09.688 --> 28:12.299
And then I tried on my own,
but every time I try,

28:12.342 --> 28:15.824
it... it never goes right.
It never...

28:20.699 --> 28:23.310
All I ever wanted
was to be good.

28:25.138 --> 28:28.619
But now I'm just...

28:28.663 --> 28:31.013
empty.

28:31.057 --> 28:35.278
Even this... I know you're here
because you love me,

28:35.322 --> 28:37.585
and I want to love you back.

28:37.628 --> 28:39.195
It's just...

28:41.676 --> 28:43.852
I can't.

28:43.896 --> 28:46.376
You can't yet.

28:46.420 --> 28:48.291
We just need time to fix this.

28:48.335 --> 28:50.076
We need to go somewhere safe,

28:50.119 --> 28:53.166
somewhere
where no one can find us.

29:28.462 --> 29:30.246
Cass, step aside.

29:30.290 --> 29:33.902
Dean. Step aside!

29:33.946 --> 29:35.643
Jack, go.

29:35.686 --> 29:36.775
Run.

29:38.254 --> 29:39.865
I can't.

29:39.908 --> 29:42.693
You have to. I won't run anymore.

29:55.576 --> 29:59.232
You're not gonna lock me up
again, are you?

29:59.275 --> 30:00.886
No.

30:48.324 --> 30:49.848
Dean?

30:52.372 --> 30:54.548
Dean!

30:54.591 --> 30:56.289
Dean!

31:00.815 --> 31:02.208
I understand.

31:02.251 --> 31:04.863
Dean, don't!

31:04.906 --> 31:07.474
Dean?

31:07.517 --> 31:09.476
Dean!

31:09.519 --> 31:11.086
I know what I've done.

31:11.130 --> 31:12.871
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, Dean!

31:12.914 --> 31:15.786
Hey, hey, hey! Dean!

31:15.830 --> 31:17.527
Stay back, Sam!

31:20.574 --> 31:24.491
And you were right all along.

31:24.534 --> 31:26.275
I am a monster.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.323
Do something.

31:34.544 --> 31:36.068
You're enjoying this.

31:36.111 --> 31:37.896
Shh.

32:28.947 --> 32:31.384
No. Pick it up!

32:33.647 --> 32:36.128
Pick it up.

32:36.171 --> 32:37.932
The hell, Chuck? This isn't how the story
is supposed to end.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.609
The story?

32:39.653 --> 32:41.698
Lookit, the... the...
The gathering storm,

32:41.742 --> 32:44.571
the gun, the... the father
killing his own son.

32:44.614 --> 32:47.095
This is Abraham and Isaac.
This is epic!

32:47.139 --> 32:48.618
Wait. What are you saying?

32:48.662 --> 32:50.316
He's saying
he's been playing us.

32:52.709 --> 32:54.668
This whole time.

32:54.711 --> 32:57.236
Come on. Our entire lives.

32:57.279 --> 32:59.455
Mom, Dad... everything.

32:59.499 --> 33:03.633
This is all you
because you wrote it all, right?

33:03.677 --> 33:06.506
Because... Because what?

33:06.549 --> 33:07.700
Because we're
your favorite show?

33:07.724 --> 33:10.249
Because we're part of
your story?

33:10.292 --> 33:13.513
Okay, Dean, no offense, but your
brother is stupid and crazy.

33:13.556 --> 33:15.384
And that kid is still dangerous.

33:15.428 --> 33:17.691
So pick up the gun.

33:17.734 --> 33:20.650
Pick it up...

33:20.694 --> 33:23.175
pull the trigger...

33:23.218 --> 33:25.003
and I'll bring her back.

33:27.701 --> 33:29.050
Your mom.

33:37.841 --> 33:39.539
No.

33:42.542 --> 33:45.153
No.

33:45.197 --> 33:47.764
My mom was my hero.

33:47.808 --> 33:49.505
And I miss her,

33:49.549 --> 33:51.681
and I will miss her
every second of my life,

33:51.725 --> 33:55.294
but she would not want this.

33:55.337 --> 33:57.731
And it's not like you
even really care.

33:57.774 --> 33:59.994
'Cause Sam's right.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.736
The Apocalypse,
the first go-around,

34:02.779 --> 34:04.042
with Lucifer and Michael...

34:04.085 --> 34:06.305
You knew everything
that was going on,

34:06.348 --> 34:08.568
so why the games, Chuck?

34:08.610 --> 34:10.960
Why don't You just snap
your fingers and end it?!

34:11.005 --> 34:12.572
Look, I...

34:12.614 --> 34:14.331
And every other bad thing
we've been killing,

34:14.356 --> 34:19.534
been dying over...
Where were you?

34:19.579 --> 34:22.016
Just sitting back
and watching us suffer

34:22.060 --> 34:26.020
so we can do this over and over
and over again...

34:26.063 --> 34:29.458
Fighting, losing people we love?

34:29.502 --> 34:32.592
When does it end? Tell me.

34:34.637 --> 34:37.553
- Dean, don't do this.
- No, we're done talking.

34:37.597 --> 34:39.728
'Cause this...

34:39.773 --> 34:41.208
This isn't just a story.

34:41.253 --> 34:43.864
It's our lives!

34:43.907 --> 34:46.562
So God or no God,
you go to hell.

34:57.094 --> 34:59.358
Have it your way.

35:03.666 --> 35:05.015
Jack.

35:07.409 --> 35:08.584
Jack!

35:08.628 --> 35:10.586
Jack!

35:10.630 --> 35:11.805
Stop it.

35:12.849 --> 35:13.850
Stop it!

35:20.640 --> 35:22.772
Jack.

35:24.687 --> 35:27.299
Hey, Chuck!

35:31.868 --> 35:33.131
Hey, Chuck!

35:34.828 --> 35:36.612
Aah!

35:41.226 --> 35:42.879
Fine!

35:42.923 --> 35:44.794
That's the way you want it?

35:49.190 --> 35:52.672
Story's over.

35:52.715 --> 35:54.630
Welcome to The End.

36:12.692 --> 36:16.565
Hey, you okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

36:22.702 --> 36:23.940
Wait. I thought Chuck said
that the gun

36:23.964 --> 36:25.922
was the only thing that could...

36:29.274 --> 36:32.886
He's a writer.

36:32.929 --> 36:33.974
Writers lie.

37:31.466 --> 37:32.772
What's happening?

37:32.815 --> 37:34.426
Yeah, about that...

37:37.037 --> 37:38.299
We should talk.

38:08.764 --> 38:09.896
What the hell is happening?!

38:12.899 --> 38:15.771
They're souls from... from Hell.

38:24.345 --> 38:27.348
Hi.

38:54.941 --> 38:56.135
Do you think it's...
Do you think it's expensive?

38:56.159 --> 38:58.074
Honestly, it might be.
I think so.
