You lied, and you lied well.

18:58.347 --> 19:01.099
‐ I know.
Can't believe I pulled that off.

19:01.099 --> 19:02.476
Should I get into politics?

19:02.476 --> 19:04.728
‐ The Alisons are trying
to screw over Celeste

19:04.728 --> 19:06.813
because they think Colin
will give them money if they do.

19:06.813 --> 19:09.316
‐ Those bribe‐taking Barbies
are not to be trusted.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.902
‐ I know, except they can't
screw Celeste over

19:11.902 --> 19:13.654
because she isn't lying.

19:14.154 --> 19:16.990
‐ But, those financial documents
the Alisons were after?

19:16.990 --> 19:20.285
‐ Everything Celeste reported
about Woöm is actually true.

19:20.285 --> 19:21.328
We're pretty much broke.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.957
‐ But, we‐we charge $200
for eyebrow brushes!

19:24.957 --> 19:27.668
They're just tiny combs!
How is that possible?

19:27.668 --> 19:30.254
‐ Celeste has always said,
"You gotta spend money to make money,"

19:30.254 --> 19:33.048
but I think she took it too far,
and I'm pretty sure she only watched

19:33.048 --> 19:35.592
the first half of the WeWork documentary.

19:35.592 --> 19:38.637
That sculpture right by the front
entrance? She spent 50K on it.

19:39.513 --> 19:42.015
‐ The one we use as a coat rack?

19:42.015 --> 19:44.768
Well, if there was nothing bad on
the laptop, why did you give it to them?

19:45.227 --> 19:48.021
‐ I don't know. I guess it just
sort of felt like a symbolic gesture

19:48.021 --> 19:49.439
of me giving the fuck up.

19:49.439 --> 19:51.525
I just get in a dark place sometimes.

19:51.525 --> 19:54.820
Can't believe I have to spend
the rest of my life with myself.

19:54.820 --> 19:56.613

19:56.613 --> 19:58.282
we're here to snap you out of it.

19:58.282 --> 20:01.076
You better start being nicer to yourself,
or I'm gonna fuck you up.

20:01.076 --> 20:02.786
That's my best friend
you're talking about.

20:02.786 --> 20:05.080
‐ Yeah. If you keep shitting on yourself,
we'll all beat you up.

20:05.080 --> 20:07.916
‐ Because we love you.
IZZY: Ugh, I am out of it.

You're right.

20:09.126 --> 20:11.545
I'm sorry I lied to you guys.

I'm not sure I'm ready
for a girlfriend and a kid.

20:21.680 --> 20:25.017
And I mean, if I'm not,
then I can't do that to Bruno

20:25.017 --> 20:27.895
because I know what that feels like.
I was that kid.

20:32.691 --> 20:34.568

20:52.628 --> 20:55.380
‐ The meeting I have to be back
for tonight isn't for Woöm.

20:55.380 --> 20:57.883
It's an interview for that
digital media job at the museum.

20:57.883 --> 20:59.676
‐ Whoa. Uh,

20:59.676 --> 21:02.471
okay, I'm seeing
we all had a lot to share.

21:02.471 --> 21:04.848

to your Spidey senses.

21:05.724 --> 21:07.392
‐ I'm really sorry they were right.

21:07.392 --> 21:10.062

urge to suggest a group hug.

21:13.982 --> 21:16.360

we think we were? Men?

‐ Jules, we do have to get
back to the private jet

21:19.530 --> 21:21.865
if you wanna make it in time.
‐ Oh, wait a second.

Did you just say "private jet"?

21:23.700 --> 21:25.702
Did you guys come to
rescue me in a private jet?

I mean, you have chicken.
You have cheese.

still pay for music on iTunes.
