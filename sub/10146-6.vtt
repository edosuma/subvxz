WEBVTT

00:00.211 --> 00:02.600
...that when Mei has taken the vanadium,
and dispose of it

00:03.010 --> 00:05.890
If you are captured, there's nothing we can do.
You're on your own.

00:06.504 --> 00:09.909
I am to be your liaison, to facilitate your
transition back to life here.

00:10.490 --> 00:13.276
To make sure that I haven't been infected
by my time in the west.

00:13.896 --> 00:14.929
I think we found a way into the plant

00:15.338 --> 00:18.283
If all goes according to plans, ETA for setting the charges,
would be 30 minutes or so

00:19.337 --> 00:21.561
We lost Finn Michael, we think Li-Na's men took him

00:22.228 --> 00:23.571
If you think Scott can handle it,
then you should tell him

00:28.261 --> 00:28.821
Jesus

00:29.444 --> 00:31.036
The chain reactions here, and here

00:31.465 --> 00:32.025
You should've told me Michael

00:32.639 --> 00:33.542
There's nothing you could've done to help

00:34.467 --> 00:36.251
We're just gonna march up there,
and hand our ...

00:55.596 --> 00:59.382
Both Washington and Whitehall has so far
refused to comment on the arrest...

01:18.410 --> 01:18.917
Sgt. Scott

01:20.439 --> 01:21.405
My name is Kwon Joon-Soo

01:22.461 --> 01:23.771
I am from the State Security Department

01:24.956 --> 01:25.284
I don't care who you are

01:26.558 --> 01:27.227
I want to see my son

01:28.280 --> 01:30.918
It is not often we have poeple sneaking into our country

01:32.076 --> 01:35.757
We have those who sneak out,
defectors I believe you call them

01:37.165 --> 01:40.693
Sometimes they bring with them terrible
tales of our nation

01:52.736 --> 01:55.358
One person claimed she has been forced to drink water

01:56.276 --> 01:58.338
Until her belly was swollen and aching

01:59.608 --> 02:01.815
And when it was so bloated she might burst open

02:02.568 --> 02:05.860
She claimed men stand down on her stomach

02:26.187 --> 02:30.421
Now I have never heard, or seen
such thing in my life

02:32.324 --> 02:33.120
If you help us

02:34.464 --> 02:36.069
If we let you and your son free

02:37.780 --> 02:40.557
I trust you will not return home with such lies either

02:56.117 --> 03:18.836
Strike Back Legacy Ep.6 subtitle by c2lia

03:31.030 --> 03:32.237
They will confess on camera

03:32.999 --> 03:36.332
That this was an organised act of aggression
from the west

03:36.796 --> 03:39.430
The westeners will prove to be a useful
negotiating tool

03:40.494 --> 03:40.990
Bargaining tool?

03:42.441 --> 03:43.476
They're much more than that

03:44.916 --> 03:47.227
They're a cause, a reason to retaliate

03:47.948 --> 03:49.238
There will be no retaliation

03:50.077 --> 03:50.575
There has to be!

03:53.788 --> 03:54.949
I meant no disrespect

04:01.178 --> 04:03.208
You'll extract the confessions from the westeners

04:04.572 --> 04:04.896
Yes sir

04:24.676 --> 04:27.733
We began emergency protocol to
deny Scott and Stonebridge

04:29.333 --> 04:29.905
...

04:31.225 --> 04:32.979
...evidence they've been operating as mercenaries

04:34.269 --> 04:37.538
...a rogue faction independent to
the government for some time now

04:38.420 --> 04:41.731
...

04:42.689 --> 04:43.119
Philip

04:48.559 --> 04:49.580
You have my deepest sympathy

04:51.548 --> 04:53.140
You really think it's worth risking a war with this?

04:54.170 --> 04:55.709
You're just looking for excuse

04:56.138 --> 04:57.247
These are my men!

04:59.923 --> 05:00.592
We don't abandon them!

05:02.031 --> 05:02.494
We don't have a choice

05:03.708 --> 05:04.917
There will be no extraction

05:05.580 --> 05:06.280
No exfil

05:07.172 --> 05:07.667
Nothing

05:35.836 --> 05:36.171
Damien

05:39.397 --> 05:39.946
You seen Finn?

05:40.664 --> 05:40.934
No

05:41.911 --> 05:42.160
You?

05:43.741 --> 05:44.044
No

06:02.245 --> 06:03.150
I should've told you about Finn

06:05.439 --> 06:06.077
Yeah

06:07.439 --> 06:08.037
You should've

06:10.849 --> 06:12.240
You're a fuckin' asshole you know it

06:14.161 --> 06:15.163
That was a wrong call to make

06:15.828 --> 06:16.437
Yeah it was

06:19.334 --> 06:20.336
And for following me here

06:25.052 --> 06:26.108
...

06:31.020 --> 06:31.377
No

06:34.020 --> 06:35.022
You would've done the same for me

06:36.483 --> 06:36.818
Yeah

06:38.056 --> 06:38.637
Yeah I would

06:40.894 --> 06:41.995
Makes us both assholes huh?

06:53.847 --> 06:56.265
Angles to tight to figure out exact location

06:57.007 --> 06:57.719
However...

07:00.481 --> 07:01.453
Sgt. Stonebridge

07:04.796 --> 07:05.451
Might be nothing

07:07.212 --> 07:09.257
It might be a deliberate gesture

07:11.052 --> 07:11.539
Signee

07:12.579 --> 07:13.228
So if it was?

07:14.292 --> 07:14.691
Huh?

07:16.250 --> 07:17.016
Would be an "E"

07:18.230 --> 07:18.845
and a "4"

07:25.702 --> 07:27.616
If that's what it is,
exfil point 4

07:32.227 --> 07:33.078
That's a pretty big "if"

07:34.411 --> 07:36.175
Whitehall made it clear they're on their own

07:41.806 --> 07:43.377
We're under direct orders to stand down

07:44.086 --> 07:45.853
This is gonna be my last mission with 20 sir

07:46.850 --> 07:50.067
I must say I have no problem disobeying
direct orders

07:51.556 --> 07:51.927
How's your russian?

07:57.540 --> 07:57.928
Where's my son?

08:00.453 --> 08:02.056
I'd like to say thank you for what you did

08:02.701 --> 08:03.597
That's no problem at all mate

08:04.711 --> 08:07.992
If you ever want was to fuck up any more
of your military operation just let us know

08:08.904 --> 08:12.238
Please, Mei was only ever my stage name,
call me Li-Na

08:12.764 --> 08:14.442
After all, we are all friends now

08:15.891 --> 08:17.140
I don't bear you any ill will

08:17.677 --> 08:20.374
You are acting under orders,
like good, loyal soldiers

08:21.255 --> 08:21.688
Get to the fucking point

08:22.431 --> 08:24.602
I'm not sure you like the point Sgt. Scott

08:25.709 --> 08:29.556
Have you ever studied the history of torture?
It's fascinating

08:30.148 --> 08:33.373
The Greeks, the Romans,
the glory of the middle-ages

08:35.410 --> 08:37.047
A constant throughout history

08:37.556 --> 08:42.054
The need to find new, inventive ways
to inflict pain upon one another

08:43.278 --> 08:45.237
But do you know where the biggest
leap forward was made?

08:46.813 --> 08:47.126
Yeah

08:47.942 --> 08:49.620
When you decide to lecture us to death

09:02.569 --> 09:03.342
Need to look

09:04.533 --> 09:05.676
It was your own government

09:06.468 --> 09:07.117
In the field

09:07.985 --> 09:08.653
Vietnam

09:09.169 --> 09:09.557
Iraq

09:10.040 --> 09:10.488
Korea

09:10.956 --> 09:11.331
Afghanistan

09:12.447 --> 09:17.249
The breathtaking mix of technological innovation
and medieval brutality

09:20.077 --> 09:25.758
But even then I suspect it could take days,
weeks to break you

09:27.048 --> 09:30.717
So I asked myself,
what is your true weakness?

09:31.658 --> 09:33.323
What would really hurt you?

09:36.278 --> 09:37.149
This is between you and me

09:38.362 --> 09:39.643
This has nothing to do with my son

09:42.727 --> 09:44.296
It has everything to do with him

09:52.763 --> 09:53.038
Finn!

09:54.678 --> 09:54.969
Let him go

09:55.797 --> 09:56.239
Let him go!

09:57.036 --> 09:57.571
A statement

09:58.087 --> 10:03.195
Declaring that your presence on North Korean soil
was a planned military aggressive move
from your government

10:03.717 --> 10:04.547
An act of war

10:04.988 --> 10:05.946
You really wanna take things that far?

10:08.150 --> 10:09.405
Think about the ...

10:10.586 --> 10:11.557
It's another worlds war

10:12.197 --> 10:12.909
When it please your government?

10:14.133 --> 10:16.751
Or is it war when there's
a profit margin inside?

10:17.436 --> 10:18.093
This is simple choice

10:18.756 --> 10:20.229
You speak, or he dies

10:21.657 --> 10:22.056
Let him go

10:22.356 --> 10:22.787
Let him go

10:23.604 --> 10:24.607
This has nothing to do with him!

10:26.496 --> 10:26.717
Let him go!

10:27.842 --> 10:29.003
Captived men don't debate

10:29.455 --> 10:30.658
They either agree, or not

10:31.821 --> 10:32.580
Let him go!

10:34.438 --> 10:34.892
He's a kid!

10:44.629 --> 10:46.103
Don't fucking touch him

10:46.908 --> 10:48.372
Don't fucking touch him!

10:57.146 --> 10:57.845
Do you recognise him?

10:59.515 --> 11:00.523
Perhaps we all look the same to you

11:01.727 --> 11:04.587
He was a soldier you spared from
your escape from the trainyard

11:05.294 --> 11:06.199
Killing your own people

11:07.265 --> 11:08.499
It's the act of a true patriot

11:09.261 --> 11:11.412
And where is your own country
in your hour of need?

11:12.529 --> 11:14.281
He had a chance to stop you,
he failed

11:15.376 --> 11:17.198
At least now he has played some part

11:23.414 --> 11:26.649
Did you feel helpless thinking
you were watching your son die?

11:28.153 --> 11:28.720
You shouldn't

11:29.617 --> 11:30.597
You're not helpless

11:32.260 --> 11:33.877
Because it is all up to you

11:34.841 --> 11:38.293
The next time, I promise it will be real

11:42.142 --> 11:43.038
I should've sent him home

11:46.290 --> 11:47.324
You can't think about that right now

11:48.645 --> 11:49.624
I had the chance Mikey

11:51.601 --> 11:52.037
But I didn't

11:55.225 --> 11:55.666
You know why?

12:00.488 --> 12:01.417
Because I'm showing off

12:04.520 --> 12:06.157
Showing my kid "look what your old man can do"

12:09.581 --> 12:10.477
It might not appear how much

12:15.805 --> 12:17.139
I carry a gun for a job

12:20.516 --> 12:21.020
I fight terrorist

12:23.277 --> 12:24.288
Transcend the world

12:26.738 --> 12:27.341
How impressive

12:33.068 --> 12:35.198
I should clear some space for my
"Father Of The Year" award

12:37.496 --> 12:37.800
Yeah

12:39.067 --> 12:41.862
Probably not much room on the shelf next year
for the "Whining Yank" award eh?

12:45.376 --> 12:45.850
Heh

12:50.078 --> 12:50.951
I've been called away

12:53.947 --> 12:55.271
They want you report on me

12:59.084 --> 13:01.578
You should tell them that you doubt my abilities

13:02.211 --> 13:04.340
That my time in the west has spoiled me

13:05.629 --> 13:05.957
No

13:07.876 --> 13:09.682
They're looking for someone to blame Joon-Soo

13:10.917 --> 13:12.349
This is a time to choose sides

13:12.971 --> 13:15.722
And believe me, you do not want to be on mine

13:24.254 --> 13:25.728
I can find a way to protect you

13:31.860 --> 13:33.989
I look at you now, a career politician

13:34.602 --> 13:38.077
A man who carefully chooses every word
in case it ...

13:39.846 --> 13:42.200
The only person you can protect is yourself

13:43.017 --> 13:44.813
You have no idea about me

13:49.906 --> 13:51.208
I know I loved you

13:52.937 --> 13:56.957
I know that every night I closed my eyes,
try to picture your face

13:57.665 --> 13:58.688
In case I forget

14:02.236 --> 14:03.707
I know you shouldn't keep them waiting

14:08.421 --> 14:09.786
You said if I ever needed your help

14:10.869 --> 14:11.623
He never call

14:12.460 --> 14:12.785
Who?

14:13.566 --> 14:13.965
Damien

14:15.635 --> 14:16.637
"I'll call you"

14:17.911 --> 14:18.697
But the phone,

14:19.652 --> 14:19.966
it never rings

14:21.027 --> 14:23.519
And that would justify leaving him in
North Korea to rot

14:25.246 --> 14:26.588
To be beaten and tortured Nina

14:27.170 --> 14:27.529
See?

14:28.171 --> 14:29.041
This is why I like you

14:30.113 --> 14:31.662
You think like a woman too

14:32.949 --> 14:34.668
You have contacts on the Russian-Korean border

14:35.465 --> 14:37.171
Access to vehicles, equipments...

14:38.276 --> 14:41.574
Colonel, it took me years to build up those contacts

14:42.916 --> 14:45.590
When I realised we'd need help,
you were the first name I thought of

14:45.901 --> 14:47.224
When I decide to help you

14:48.071 --> 14:51.957
Any one door we have to get in and out
of the country will be very small

14:52.921 --> 14:53.601
We miss it

14:54.598 --> 14:55.255
We finished

15:03.042 --> 15:03.581
Let's go

15:35.300 --> 15:35.571
Finn

15:39.646 --> 15:39.896
Finn

15:40.710 --> 15:41.133
Damien

15:44.471 --> 15:45.288
It's gonna be ok

15:48.484 --> 15:49.637
Don't believe your father Finn

15:50.096 --> 15:50.918
It's not ok

15:51.848 --> 15:59.017
None of this ..., the pain, the west
has inflicted upon this nation could ever
be described as "ok"

15:59.467 --> 15:59.802
Shut up

16:02.120 --> 16:02.584
I'm sorry

16:05.140 --> 16:05.917
It'll be ok

16:06.708 --> 16:07.247
I promise

16:07.932 --> 16:10.621
Then you have until the count of three
to fulfill that promise

16:10.550 --> 16:11.120
Put the gun down

16:11.497 --> 16:11.889
One

16:12.331 --> 16:13.225
Put the fucking gun down!

16:13.665 --> 16:14.108
Two

16:15.191 --> 16:15.517
Stop!

16:17.147 --> 16:18.040
I'll say whatever you want

16:20.295 --> 16:21.102
I mean it

16:23.098 --> 16:23.980
I'll say whatever

16:25.836 --> 16:26.503
Put it down, please

16:48.324 --> 16:49.968
My name is Sgt. Damien Scott

16:52.631 --> 16:54.566
Formerly with the 1st Special Forces

16:55.897 --> 16:56.769
Operational Detachment

16:57.810 --> 16:58.306
DELTA

17:00.840 --> 17:02.720
Currently serving Section 20

17:05.076 --> 17:07.898
A branch of the British Military Intelligence Service

17:11.517 --> 17:15.132
We were ordered to covertly going to North Korea

17:17.758 --> 17:20.948
With the intention of comitting terrorist attacks

17:22.042 --> 17:23.891
Deliberately destabilizing the government

17:28.218 --> 17:37.529
We acted with the full knowledge and consent
of both the British and the American government

17:40.879 --> 17:42.105
We do not act alone

17:51.591 --> 17:52.877
My name is Michael Stonebridge

17:55.915 --> 17:57.149
Sgt. Michael Stonebridge

18:01.732 --> 18:05.844
And I enjoy going to the cinema,
listening to musics, and long walks in the park

18:07.076 --> 18:08.886
So if you're single and looking for some fun,
give me a call

18:09.884 --> 18:11.882
I'm sure there's a number coming up
on your screen at home

18:13.716 --> 18:14.597
Isn't that the sort of thing you're after?

18:15.886 --> 18:16.437
Oh I'm sorry

18:17.357 --> 18:18.380
North Korea that's right

18:20.719 --> 18:21.710
You know what gets me?

18:23.709 --> 18:25.522
You have this whole military first policy

18:26.800 --> 18:31.198
Hundreds and thousands of people starving to death
but money being pumped into the armed forces

18:32.523 --> 18:35.190
A million man army...a million?

18:37.176 --> 18:41.912
And we just waltz in here and we just
fucked it up in a matter of hours.
I mean that's really rather embarrassing isn't it?

18:51.476 --> 18:54.383
Perhaps you need me to start the
countdown from three?

18:55.016 --> 18:55.437
Go ahead

18:56.187 --> 18:57.371
He's not my kid, I don't care

19:00.839 --> 19:01.646
I think you do care

19:04.676 --> 19:06.232
Otherwise you wouldn't come here with him

19:07.411 --> 19:08.131
That's my job

19:09.735 --> 19:11.161
It's called being professional

19:16.090 --> 19:16.837
But for you

19:21.289 --> 19:23.232
For you this is personal isn't it?

19:24.061 --> 19:25.362
This is a mean to an end

19:26.725 --> 19:27.038
Yeah

19:28.293 --> 19:29.347
Yeah you say that

19:30.377 --> 19:31.785
But let's look at the fact shall we?

19:32.476 --> 19:33.289
You must have been what...

19:34.129 --> 19:37.041
13? 14? When they took you from your parents?
Your family

19:37.868 --> 19:38.986
Never saw them again

19:41.015 --> 19:46.957
They molded you, shaped you,
sent you away more than 20 years living a lie.

19:48.093 --> 19:49.438
Someone elses name

19:49.930 --> 19:50.866
Personality

19:51.381 --> 19:52.907
A decade of that married

19:53.766 --> 19:55.881
Sharing a bed with a man you didn't even love

19:56.159 --> 19:57.278
All for the nation, for the cause

19:57.663 --> 19:59.909
I mean the strength

20:00.458 --> 20:02.606
The conviction you must've needed

20:05.063 --> 20:09.455
And we just walked in here and ruined
all of it in a blink of an eye

20:10.667 --> 20:14.545
Blew your cover, ruined your glorious homecoming

20:15.726 --> 20:17.348
All that work

20:18.059 --> 20:20.969
All those years, for nothing

20:22.802 --> 20:27.707
So please, tell me that's not fucking personal!

20:37.424 --> 20:37.829
I told ya

20:41.103 --> 20:42.112
What did you say?

20:51.037 --> 20:51.361
Come here

20:51.941 --> 20:52.237
Come here

20:53.253 --> 20:53.749
Give it to me

20:54.316 --> 20:54.668
Come here

20:55.681 --> 20:56.177
Let it go

20:59.696 --> 21:00.139
On your knees

21:00.970 --> 21:01.762
On your fucking knees!

21:03.716 --> 21:03.957
Scott

21:04.909 --> 21:06.477
...

21:06.897 --> 21:07.758
After what she did to Finn

21:08.144 --> 21:08.768
Julia

21:08.596 --> 21:12.687
Yeah but it's a long walk between here and
anything that resembles safety

21:13.255 --> 21:14.637
We're gonna need a hostage and the one that counts

21:16.017 --> 21:16.588
Your fuckin' lucky

21:17.511 --> 21:17.942
Now turn around

21:19.629 --> 21:20.413
Turn around!

21:21.023 --> 21:23.204
Scott, mate, take this

21:27.191 --> 21:27.537
Here

21:28.777 --> 21:29.526
You know how to use that?

21:30.389 --> 21:30.730
No?

21:31.418 --> 21:32.032
It's yours

21:32.786 --> 21:33.238
Alright

21:34.076 --> 21:34.529
Here

21:35.069 --> 21:36.613
See that? That's the safety

21:37.001 --> 21:37.917
You always keep that off

21:38.731 --> 21:39.603
That's the real safety

21:40.041 --> 21:40.679
Trigger finger

21:41.462 --> 21:41.861
Alright?

21:42.881 --> 21:46.597
Point that at the people that pissed you off,
and fucking shoot them

21:48.304 --> 21:48.618
Come on. Forward

21:51.767 --> 21:53.228
Let's go buddy. Come on

21:58.727 --> 21:58.976
This way

21:59.709 --> 21:59.957
Come here

22:24.608 --> 22:29.089
Finn, stay there. It's good clear?
Clear

22:30.511 --> 22:31.104
Going left?

22:32.349 --> 22:32.854
Go

22:35.271 --> 22:36.121
Oh shit

22:37.419 --> 22:38.090
Jesus Christ

22:41.759 --> 22:42.771
Right right right

22:47.949 --> 22:49.205
Oh shit it's a maze

22:52.316 --> 22:53.066
Come on Scott, come on

22:53.882 --> 22:54.211
Come on

22:54.701 --> 22:55.122
Let's go Finn

22:58.149 --> 22:58.547
Got movement?

22:59.621 --> 22:59.870
Clear

23:01.008 --> 23:01.814
Go? Go left?

23:02.676 --> 23:03.298
No, hold, hold it!

23:22.543 --> 23:22.982
Stay with me

23:28.613 --> 23:28.876
Finn come here

23:29.301 --> 23:29.565
You got no choice

23:30.603 --> 23:31.636
You got no choice

23:32.730 --> 23:33.119
He's not dead

23:33.667 --> 23:36.847
Move, move, go with Mikey

23:39.569 --> 23:41.134
Hey, it's not your fault.
It's not your fault.

23:45.410 --> 23:47.077
Boss gave us 72 hours to get to that exfil

23:48.050 --> 23:49.641
Yeah? Which way we're going then?

23:50.575 --> 23:51.920
I've got a good feeling it's that way out

23:51.938 --> 23:53.414
Yeah?
Well there could be more soldiers

23:53.887 --> 23:55.677
Let's go come on

24:17.734 --> 24:18.982
Ok establish your perimeter

24:19.550 --> 24:20.814
Treat anyone as a potential enemy

24:21.884 --> 24:23.376
If we're seen, we're finished

24:27.822 --> 24:28.060
Go!

24:31.806 --> 24:32.043
Finn

24:32.795 --> 24:33.151
Get in the car

24:39.423 --> 24:40.724
Got it Mike?
Go go go!

24:51.981 --> 24:53.540
Hang on.
We're gonna smash our way out of here.

25:01.782 --> 25:03.278
Get out, get out.
Get out of the car!

25:10.427 --> 25:11.429
Finn! Come on!

25:12.666 --> 25:13.268
Move it, move it

25:14.206 --> 25:14.917
Come here, stick with me

25:24.585 --> 25:24.978
Get in the car

25:28.148 --> 25:28.580
Fuck! Get in the car!

25:29.671 --> 25:32.177
Go! Finn come on!
Go go!

25:34.756 --> 25:35.480
Stay down!
Stay down!

25:52.102 --> 25:53.362
... fucking hell

25:57.853 --> 25:58.506
How you doing Finn?

26:01.143 --> 26:01.494
Finn?

26:03.916 --> 26:04.146
Fuck!

26:06.874 --> 26:08.044
No, no!

26:08.803 --> 26:10.048
Here, here!

26:11.250 --> 26:11.952
Jesus Christ!

26:12.908 --> 26:13.536
Mikey?
Yeah?

26:13.906 --> 26:14.832
He's been hit!
How bad?

26:15.556 --> 26:15.753
Not great

26:18.328 --> 26:18.853
Jesus Christ

26:19.598 --> 26:21.094
Here, put some pressure on that

26:21.625 --> 26:22.226
You're gonna be fine

26:23.239 --> 26:25.062
Mikey, get us to a hospital alright?
Yeah

26:26.139 --> 26:26.926
It's pretty bad.
Yeah

26:27.680 --> 26:29.425
Hold on!
I saw a sign back there!

26:42.687 --> 26:43.328
You got him?

26:48.357 --> 26:49.299
Is there a doctor here?

26:54.777 --> 26:55.233
Hey

26:55.825 --> 26:56.266
You a doctor?

26:57.199 --> 26:57.629
You a doctor?

26:58.392 --> 26:58.901
Yeah

26:59.200 --> 27:00.542
Stop. He's been shot, alright?

27:01.142 --> 27:05.106
He needs attention, immediately.
Please! Please!

27:06.355 --> 27:06.745
This way

27:11.560 --> 27:13.790
Tell them to empty their pockets of cellphones,
pagers, whatever

27:14.390 --> 27:15.707
Move

27:24.629 --> 27:29.168
Here. Make this very clear that if anyone tries to
signal outside it would be a very bad idea.

27:41.304 --> 27:42.305
You don't need to keep that gun on us

27:47.262 --> 27:47.779
He's my son

27:48.196 --> 27:48.533
Yes

27:49.385 --> 27:50.068
I had a son as well

29:56.945 --> 29:58.911
No, no thanks.
Cause I'm not gonna kill ya

30:32.355 --> 30:32.625
Fucks

30:36.830 --> 30:38.623
What's going on out there Mike?
Backup's here

30:38.855 --> 30:39.788
How you doing doc?

30:40.296 --> 30:44.101
After all I can do but he will need proper medical attention.
We don't have the supplies here.

30:53.604 --> 30:54.117
Is there another way out?

30:55.967 --> 31:00.072
You want to save lives then help us get out.
Because if they send troops in it will be
a bloodbath and nobody wants that.

31:20.596 --> 31:20.901
Mikey

31:26.613 --> 31:27.444
What's gonna happen to you now?

31:28.047 --> 31:29.621
Two army came to the hospital

31:29.988 --> 31:30.883
And demand our assistance

31:31.260 --> 31:33.977
Myself, and a nurse were the first go with them
but we refuse to help

31:34.374 --> 31:36.778
All that remains is some physical evidence of
the struggle

31:39.426 --> 31:39.719
No way

31:40.106 --> 31:41.067
I'm not fucking doing that

31:44.360 --> 31:45.621
Then they will know that I help you

31:46.322 --> 31:46.786
You have to. Please...

31:52.876 --> 31:54.975
You alright?
Yeah just go. Go, please.

31:55.023 --> 31:58.224
Thanks. Sorry.
Go Mikey.

33:21.621 --> 33:22.961
I heard about the execution order

33:24.376 --> 33:25.037
And as you said

33:26.061 --> 33:27.469
It is time to choose side

34:01.516 --> 34:02.037
We gotta go

34:02.444 --> 34:02.717
We wait

34:02.902 --> 34:04.179
No, we can't wait.

34:05.145 --> 34:07.477
I swear to God he ...
we've got a problem

34:08.146 --> 34:09.789
We have lost too many people already

34:11.315 --> 34:15.585
I mean it.
We stay to the very last second.

34:16.630 --> 34:18.556
We give them every goddamn chance we can

34:47.436 --> 34:47.801
Go!

35:21.387 --> 35:21.672
Shit!

35:23.822 --> 35:24.585
Ah shit!

35:25.273 --> 35:26.628
What the fuck Mike?
Shit! It's dead!

35:26.696 --> 35:27.822
You ok?

35:36.332 --> 35:36.900
Mikey

35:37.383 --> 35:37.903
The truck's fucked

35:38.904 --> 35:39.699
How are we getting out of here?

35:40.899 --> 35:41.220
Huh?

35:44.349 --> 35:46.055
I have an idea but you are not gonna like it

35:49.772 --> 35:50.577
Go, come on

35:55.940 --> 35:56.688
Yah! Come on!
Come on!

36:02.744 --> 36:03.406
Woah fucked!

36:06.024 --> 36:06.804
Get them Scott!

36:30.587 --> 36:31.535
Bring it down!

36:53.636 --> 36:53.969
Come on!

37:08.269 --> 37:08.882
Ah fuck!

37:13.311 --> 37:13.757
Hang on Mike!

37:16.796 --> 37:17.088
Hold on!

38:06.098 --> 38:10.900
Hey, how you doing?

38:13.091 --> 38:13.458
I'm alright

38:19.005 --> 38:20.187
You've been out for a couple of days

38:23.202 --> 38:26.630
It didn't take a while for your wheels
to start turning properly again

38:32.230 --> 38:32.760
Finn...

38:35.260 --> 38:36.656
I'm sorry for everything that happened

38:37.503 --> 38:38.217
Forget it

38:41.188 --> 38:44.152
I don't know anyone else's dad that could've done
what you did for me

38:46.974 --> 38:47.527
Well...

38:50.523 --> 38:51.802
It's the first time you call me dad

38:57.109 --> 38:58.096
Makes me feel kinda old

38:58.734 --> 38:59.319
You are old

39:02.878 --> 39:03.302
Thanks

39:08.743 --> 39:10.148
I think that all of these dads

39:11.143 --> 39:13.237
Making promises to their kids they can't keep

39:13.717 --> 39:15.477
Tell 'em they'll take 'em fishing on the weekend

39:16.671 --> 39:17.277
Then they can't

39:18.030 --> 39:18.463
Cause of work

39:19.339 --> 39:19.977
You've gotta work

39:22.510 --> 39:22.901
Yeah

39:25.371 --> 39:28.899
When this is all done,

39:30.656 --> 39:32.041
and I got the chance,
we are gonna do this properly

39:39.727 --> 39:41.110
I love getting to know you Finn

39:43.719 --> 39:44.037
And?

39:44.708 --> 39:45.497
How is patient?

39:46.026 --> 39:46.912
A little bit hot

39:54.105 --> 39:55.477
You want me to bring you cold ...?

39:56.390 --> 39:57.316
That would be great

39:58.174 --> 39:58.527
Yeah thanks

40:00.596 --> 40:00.917
Thanks

40:15.425 --> 40:15.804
What is it?

40:18.446 --> 40:19.343
This is goodbye

40:21.973 --> 40:22.493
I'm shipping out

40:24.556 --> 40:25.783
The D.E.A called me back

40:28.956 --> 40:34.710
I've got an extra week or so to take Finn with me,
make sure he gets out ok this time

40:37.066 --> 40:40.022
I'm getting sick of pulling your asses out of
the field anyway

40:41.036 --> 40:41.414
Yeah fair enough

40:46.842 --> 40:47.255
Kim...

40:47.750 --> 40:48.765
It's Julia

40:53.059 --> 40:54.251
I can't stop thinking

40:55.456 --> 40:57.237
That I could've done something more to save her

41:01.903 --> 41:02.917
You know it's not your fault right?

41:06.408 --> 41:06.982
Yeah.
Yeah.

41:16.132 --> 41:16.759
I did fuck it

41:17.601 --> 41:19.328
Is there a reason you never try making
a move on me?

41:23.177 --> 41:23.988
Because I'm a gentleman

41:29.987 --> 41:30.334
And yeah

41:34.356 --> 41:36.568
I knwo what happens when you get attached
to someone in this job

41:39.436 --> 41:40.527
When you care about them

42:01.840 --> 42:03.092
Here's to what could've been

42:04.504 --> 42:05.305
Would've been brilliant

42:06.027 --> 42:06.729
Here's to another life

42:10.648 --> 42:11.284
So what's gonna happen now?

42:12.179 --> 42:12.544
Huh?

42:13.339 --> 42:15.633
Well I mean you went against orders
and came back to get us

42:16.196 --> 42:17.090
Let me worry about that

42:18.191 --> 42:19.810
That would be ...

42:21.596 --> 42:22.136
What about you?

42:24.056 --> 42:24.557
I'm alright

42:25.439 --> 42:25.892
I guess

42:28.000 --> 42:30.543
Just that keep seeing Finn laying in that
hospital bed

42:31.761 --> 42:35.731
He's gonna wake up one day and realised

42:36.550 --> 42:38.254
Wanted to see my dad and look what happen?
I got kidnapped, and tortured...

42:38.685 --> 42:39.776
And you risk everyhting to get him back

42:41.159 --> 42:41.959
That's what he will remember

42:43.541 --> 42:43.930
Guys

42:45.170 --> 42:45.927
You need to see this

42:48.084 --> 42:49.345
It came from a colleague of mine

42:49.991 --> 42:50.608
Dansky

42:52.126 --> 42:54.717
She's embedded with the Russian mafia in Vienna

42:57.323 --> 42:57.820
Shit

42:59.586 --> 43:00.558
That's the guy who tortured me

43:01.559 --> 43:02.456
Kwon Joon-Soo

43:03.306 --> 43:05.710
According to Dansky, he's been putting out fillers

43:06.572 --> 43:09.247
Getting some hired muscle, some assistance

43:09.636 --> 43:10.336
Assistance with what?

43:11.282 --> 43:13.936
They whispers about a high-level attack in Europe

43:17.307 --> 43:18.560
Well, we bought the fight to North Korea

43:19.357 --> 43:20.446
That would bring it back to us

43:21.567 --> 43:22.357
Yeah but what she planning boss?

43:22.956 --> 43:23.445
I'm not sure Michael.

43:24.598 --> 43:28.854
But whatever it is,
she's only just started.
