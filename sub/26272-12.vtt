00:09.270 --> 00:11.185
MAN:
There's another one,

00:11.228 --> 00:14.188
down by the spa.

00:52.095 --> 00:54.967
You asked me how to get ahead
at the firm.

00:55.011 --> 00:56.578
That's how you do it.

00:56.621 --> 01:00.016
What about merit?
W-What about hard work?

01:01.235 --> 01:04.020
Let me explain something to you.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.848
For you to rise in the ranks,

01:05.891 --> 01:07.632
someone has to make room
for you.

01:07.676 --> 01:08.938
They have to give up something,

01:08.981 --> 01:13.029
maybe a raise
or part of a bonus.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.510
Now why is someone going to be
giving up something

01:15.553 --> 01:18.078
unless they get something?

01:22.517 --> 01:25.476
Oh, geez. It's behind you,
corner of the bar.

02:00.207 --> 02:04.428
M.E. HENSON:
January 5th, 9:40 p.m.

02:04.472 --> 02:05.951
Postmortem
examination.

02:05.995 --> 02:09.477
External search: Negative.
Internal trunk exploration:

02:09.520 --> 02:11.653
Negative.

02:11.696 --> 02:15.047
Forensic evidence
discovered: None.

02:17.528 --> 02:19.443
How is that possible?

02:19.487 --> 02:20.966
Excuse me?

02:21.010 --> 02:23.578
This man's killed four women
in a year and a half.

02:23.621 --> 02:26.146
How is it he can hide
in women's bathrooms,

02:26.189 --> 02:28.409
chloroform his victims,
undress them,

02:28.452 --> 02:30.715
undress himself,
have sex with them,

02:30.759 --> 02:32.152
strangle them to death,

02:32.195 --> 02:34.371
and still not leave one bit
of forensic evidence?

02:34.415 --> 02:36.982
Not one drop of semen?
Not one fleck of skin?

02:37.026 --> 02:39.463
Listen, I know you're new here,
but, uh, Dr....?

02:39.507 --> 02:41.465
Martin. Julia Martin.

02:41.509 --> 02:43.119
We're talking
public bathrooms.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.730
They're a convention center
of forensic evidence.

02:45.774 --> 02:47.863
The victims' bodies,
that's another story.

02:47.906 --> 02:49.865
That's how we'll get him.

02:53.434 --> 02:55.131
PETER: Dr. Martin,
you're still here?

02:55.175 --> 02:57.873
I'd like to take another look
at Emily Baker's body.

02:57.916 --> 03:00.484
Eh, kind of late.
Everyone's gone.

03:00.528 --> 03:02.530
That's okay. I'll be fine.

03:02.573 --> 03:05.185
I'll put everything back
the way I found it.

03:09.058 --> 03:11.234
HOLLOWAY: We're obviously
thrilled that this afternoon,

03:11.278 --> 03:13.758
a jury of his peers
convicted John Malford,

03:13.802 --> 03:16.544
otherwise known as
the "Bathroom Stall Butcher,"

03:16.587 --> 03:18.763
for the murder
of young Emily Baker.

03:18.807 --> 03:21.810
Special thanks to the New York City Medical Examiner's Office,

03:21.853 --> 03:24.595
in particular
to Julia Martin,

03:24.639 --> 03:27.032
whose tireless work led to the
discovery of the pivotal piece

03:27.076 --> 03:29.557
of evidence against
John Malford.

03:32.821 --> 03:36.041
Hi. Welcome to Billy's.

03:36.085 --> 03:39.480
If you're gonna be a successful
attorney in Manhattan,

03:39.523 --> 03:41.482
this is a place you need
to know about.

03:41.525 --> 03:43.701
Oh, I didn't even know
there was a Billy's.

03:43.745 --> 03:48.619
Well, consider tonight as a part
of your legal education.Thanks.

03:48.663 --> 03:51.448
As a matter of fact,
FDR used to settle cases

03:51.492 --> 03:52.710
at that table
right there

03:52.754 --> 03:54.625
in the back.Oh, I don't care about all that.

03:54.669 --> 03:56.453
Show me where
the Benny Colón booth is.

03:56.497 --> 03:58.629
No, this ain't
Dunkin' Donuts.

03:58.673 --> 04:00.544
Why don't you find us a table.

04:00.588 --> 04:02.981
I'll grab us some drinks.

04:03.025 --> 04:05.114
STELLA:
Benjamin Colón.

04:05.157 --> 04:06.289
Stella!

04:06.333 --> 04:08.509
And Ryan.

04:08.552 --> 04:10.554
Wow...

04:10.598 --> 04:11.860
What is the occasion?

04:11.903 --> 04:13.557
You two look like a pair
of breathalyzer tests

04:13.601 --> 04:14.776
waiting to happen.

04:14.819 --> 04:16.778
Well, truth is I have
a pretty good shot

04:16.821 --> 04:18.388
at getting a client
out of prison.

04:18.432 --> 04:19.998
Guy was put away for life, so...

04:20.042 --> 04:22.871
So what'd you do? You bake him
a cake with a hacksaw in it?

04:26.004 --> 04:27.745
One better.
Ah.

04:27.789 --> 04:29.878
I discovered the evidence
that got him convicted

04:29.921 --> 04:31.401
may have been tampered with.

04:31.445 --> 04:32.750
Seriously?Yeah.

04:32.794 --> 04:34.578
By, uh, the police, or...?

04:34.622 --> 04:35.884
Medical Examiner's Office.

04:35.927 --> 04:37.538
Yeah.
I petitioned to have

04:37.581 --> 04:40.236
a client's DNA evidence retested

04:40.280 --> 04:43.195
and it came back-- no match,
not even close.

04:43.239 --> 04:45.285
Well, who's
the medical examiner?

04:45.328 --> 04:47.809
You know Julia Martin?

04:47.852 --> 04:50.551
No, no, no, no.
That must be a mistake.

04:50.594 --> 04:52.640
She was picked up this morning.

04:52.683 --> 04:54.685
D.A.'s office thinks
it was intentional.

04:54.729 --> 04:56.731
Who is your client?

04:56.774 --> 05:00.561
Remember the "Bathroom Stall
Butcher," John Malford?

05:00.604 --> 05:03.955
BULL: I hate
trolling for cases.

05:03.999 --> 05:05.653
I like to be asked.

05:05.696 --> 05:07.481
I like to be the one
who can say no.

05:07.524 --> 05:10.875
We are not trolling.
We are offering our services.

05:10.919 --> 05:14.488
And trust me, so is every other
A-list criminal firm in town.

05:14.531 --> 05:16.533
I mean, this is
Julia Martin.

05:16.577 --> 05:19.536
Chief Medical Examiner
for the City of New York.

05:19.580 --> 05:22.626
These are the kinds of cases
that get the town talking.

05:22.670 --> 05:26.674
Plus, I know her. There's no way
she'd tamper with evidence.

05:26.717 --> 05:28.502
Well, obviously the D.A.
doesn't agree with you

05:28.545 --> 05:29.851
or he wouldn't have
arrested her.

05:29.894 --> 05:31.548
Plus, I know she has
a big title,

05:31.592 --> 05:34.377
but at the end of the day
she's just a civil servant.

05:34.421 --> 05:36.161
What are you
trying to say?

05:36.205 --> 05:38.033
Well, is this another
pro bono situation?

05:38.076 --> 05:41.602
Because, frankly,
I've become such a pro at bono,

05:41.645 --> 05:44.779
I'm getting ready to start
my own Irish rock band.

05:47.172 --> 05:50.654
You wake up in the morning
and you go over in your head

05:50.698 --> 05:53.353
all those hundreds of things
that you have to do this week.

05:53.396 --> 05:58.140
It just doesn't occur to you
that you might get arrested.

05:58.183 --> 06:00.751
You might spend
your first night in jail.

06:03.493 --> 06:06.409
I'm the Chief Medical Examiner
for the City of New York.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.063
We want to help you, Julia.

06:08.106 --> 06:11.588
You know I can't afford to pay
top-shelf guys like you.

06:11.632 --> 06:12.589
We'll be fine.

06:12.633 --> 06:14.635
Will I be?

06:14.678 --> 06:17.420
I also can't afford for you
to do a half-assed job

06:17.464 --> 06:20.031
because you're just in it
for the free press.

06:20.075 --> 06:22.425
Keep in mind the best press
for everyone

06:22.469 --> 06:24.035
is about your
ultimate acquittal.

06:24.079 --> 06:25.820
You keep that in mind.

06:28.866 --> 06:33.262
All right then,
I guess it's the two of you.

06:33.305 --> 06:34.568
Lucky us.

06:34.611 --> 06:37.484
So here's what I know.
Six years ago,

06:37.527 --> 06:39.834
when I found that hair
in the back of a woman's throat,

06:39.877 --> 06:43.664
it was a perfect match
to John Malford's hair, perfect.

06:43.707 --> 06:47.407
100%. I still have
the evidence that says so,

06:47.450 --> 06:51.062
so I'm not clear
exactly why we're here.

06:51.106 --> 06:52.760
The problem is
Malford's attorney

06:52.803 --> 06:54.718
was running out of appeals,

06:54.762 --> 06:57.199
so he decided
to throw a Hail Mary

06:57.242 --> 06:59.984
and petitioned for
a new analysis of the hair,

07:00.028 --> 07:03.161
an outside analysis
of the hair.

07:03.205 --> 07:06.600
And when an outside lab tested
it, it came back negative.

07:06.643 --> 07:08.340
And after they popped
their champagne,

07:08.384 --> 07:11.735
they sent it to three more labs,
and it also came back negative.

07:11.779 --> 07:13.781
It didn't match
Malford's hair at all.

07:13.824 --> 07:15.826
That's not plausible.

07:15.870 --> 07:19.613
Someone switched the hairs,
or they tested the wrong hair.

07:19.656 --> 07:21.528
Julia, it's completely
plausible.

07:21.571 --> 07:23.965
You don't have to agree with it,
but it's certainly plausible.

07:24.008 --> 07:25.401
No. You're wrong. It isn't.

07:27.359 --> 07:29.797
There's no circumstance
under which I would ever

07:29.840 --> 07:31.973
tamper with evidence
in any case.

07:32.016 --> 07:33.670
Everyone knows this
about me.

07:33.714 --> 07:36.630
No. Everyone does not.

07:36.673 --> 07:39.502
Think about it.

07:39.546 --> 07:42.723
You performed the examination
sometime after midnight.

07:42.766 --> 07:44.681
You were alone
in the autopsy room,

07:44.725 --> 07:46.770
and lack of plausibility
is not the argument

07:46.814 --> 07:48.468
that's gonna win
the case for you.

07:48.511 --> 07:51.949
Okay. You know that
it was a pubic hair.

07:51.993 --> 07:53.734
Right? It was
a man's pubic hair.

07:53.777 --> 07:57.651
I found it in the deepest
recesses of her esophagus.

07:57.694 --> 08:01.785
So let's say that I am
going to plant a hair.

08:01.829 --> 08:04.179
Where would I have gotten
a male pubic hair from?

08:04.222 --> 08:07.225
Oh, come on. Those can't be that
hard to come by in the morgue.

08:07.269 --> 08:09.097
Is it possible you made
a mistake?

08:09.140 --> 08:11.447
Excuse me?I mean, maybe

08:11.491 --> 08:13.667
you thought you
found evidence

08:13.710 --> 08:15.886
that was relevant to
the case, but it wasn't.

08:15.930 --> 08:17.714
Emily might've

08:17.758 --> 08:20.108
indulged in oral sex
with someone else,

08:20.151 --> 08:22.980
consensual contact.
You did an autopsy.

08:23.024 --> 08:26.114
You found this hair.
It was a mistake.

08:26.157 --> 08:30.466
No, that's not possible.
I ran every test that there was.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.903
I ran every test myself.
That was his hair.

08:32.947 --> 08:34.122
Keep in mind,

08:34.165 --> 08:36.428
if it was truly
a mistake,

08:36.472 --> 08:38.822
then there is
no criminal intent.

08:38.866 --> 08:42.739
If there is no criminal intent,
then there's no crime.

08:42.783 --> 08:45.220
Mistakes.
Everybody makes them.

08:47.265 --> 08:51.269
So you're telling me,
if I say that I made a mistake,

08:51.313 --> 08:52.880
the charges might be withdrawn?

08:52.923 --> 08:55.143
Well, it's certainly something
I'd like to take to the D.A.

08:55.186 --> 08:57.232
I can't imagine that they
would want to go forward

08:57.275 --> 08:58.494
with this trial.

09:01.149 --> 09:03.891
I can't.You can't what?

09:03.934 --> 09:05.153
I can't say that

09:05.196 --> 09:07.590
because I don't
make mistakes,

09:07.634 --> 09:09.810
not when it comes
to forensic science.

09:09.853 --> 09:14.510
Does that change anything
for the two of you?

09:17.034 --> 09:21.691
Just makes the job harder,
but we didn't take up the offer

09:21.735 --> 09:23.954
because we thought
it was gonna be easy.

09:23.998 --> 09:28.219
We told you we wanted
to defend you, and we mean it.

09:29.743 --> 09:31.788
So what's the plan?

09:31.832 --> 09:33.355
Well, to get you out
on bail, for starters.

09:33.398 --> 09:35.183
I'll talk to the D.A.
in the morning, get a lay

09:35.226 --> 09:37.489
of the land and see what they
think they have on you.

09:37.533 --> 09:38.795
Dr. Martin.

09:40.449 --> 09:42.930
Julia.

09:47.891 --> 09:48.805
Thank you.

09:50.851 --> 09:53.984
Did you say...Thank you.

09:54.028 --> 09:55.769
You're welcome.

10:07.650 --> 10:09.652
The truth is you know
she couldn't have done this.

10:09.696 --> 10:12.437
She'd rather cut off her own arm
than give you a false report.

10:12.481 --> 10:13.917
And yet, she did.

10:13.961 --> 10:16.485
You think I'm looking
to take down a medical examiner?

10:16.528 --> 10:18.095
We work with them every day.

10:18.139 --> 10:20.010
I've had these results
checked and rechecked

10:20.054 --> 10:22.796
with four different labs.
She screwed up,

10:22.839 --> 10:24.319
which makes all of us look bad.

10:24.362 --> 10:26.060
Have you actually considered
the repercussions of this?

10:26.103 --> 10:27.409
You convict the Chief

10:27.452 --> 10:29.454
Medical Examiner for
the City of New York,

10:29.498 --> 10:31.761
and you are handing
a "get out of jail free" card

10:31.805 --> 10:33.502
to everyone you've ever
put behind bars.

10:33.545 --> 10:37.114
You will have a mile-long line
of attorneys out your door

10:37.158 --> 10:38.942
claiming that their clients
were falsely convicted.

10:38.986 --> 10:40.161
Is that what you want?

10:42.206 --> 10:44.165
Your discovery packet.

10:44.208 --> 10:45.949
Assuming you're still
gonna want the case

10:45.993 --> 10:47.429
once you see
what's in there.

10:47.472 --> 10:48.909
Okay, what's in there?

10:48.952 --> 10:52.521
Julia's first examination
of Emily Baker's corpse,

10:52.564 --> 10:54.131
she came up with nothing.

10:54.175 --> 10:57.265
Okay, so she found the evidence
the second time through.

10:57.308 --> 10:58.701
And that's fine,

10:58.745 --> 11:01.008
except she completely deleted
the first report.

11:01.051 --> 11:02.705
The one where
she came up empty,

11:02.749 --> 11:05.969
just plucked it out of the
system like it never happened.

11:06.013 --> 11:07.623
That's a big no-no.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.190
Okay.

11:09.233 --> 11:12.410
You know it's a breach of
protocol to delete any reports.

11:12.454 --> 11:14.935
Even ones that are later
replaced by updated results,

11:14.978 --> 11:16.588
and you know why.

11:16.632 --> 11:20.636
Because it can be construed
as consciousness of guilt.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.118
Julia's the best there is.

11:24.161 --> 11:27.948
Do you think she'd accidentally
forget protocol?

11:27.991 --> 11:30.341
She couldn't find any evidence
on the dead girl,

11:30.385 --> 11:32.735
she decided to take matters
into her own hands

11:32.779 --> 11:34.215
and create some.

11:38.001 --> 11:40.656
Oh, here's the bail agreement.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.223
Is she on her way?Already here.

11:42.266 --> 11:44.529
She and Benny are
waiting in your office.

11:44.573 --> 11:48.359
Assistant District Attorney
Williams is not your friend.

11:48.403 --> 11:50.144
I never said that he was.

11:50.187 --> 11:53.016
He's claiming you destroyed
an official autopsy report.

11:54.670 --> 11:57.629
Did you write an official report
stating that you didn't find

11:57.673 --> 12:00.807
any physical evidence after
your examination of Emily Baker

12:00.850 --> 12:03.853
and then delete that report from
the official citywide records?

12:03.897 --> 12:05.420
Yes.

12:05.463 --> 12:07.248
It was...

12:07.291 --> 12:08.815
years ago. I mean...

12:08.858 --> 12:11.121
You have to know how bad
that's gonna look to a jury.

12:11.165 --> 12:12.775
That first report was useless.

12:12.819 --> 12:15.256
It only said
that I didn't find anything.

12:15.299 --> 12:16.823
Yes, but in a court of law,

12:16.866 --> 12:20.000
it's going to look like
a prior inconsistent statement.

12:20.043 --> 12:22.785
You weren't supposed
to delete it.

12:22.829 --> 12:26.267
You were supposed to keep it
and turn it over in discovery.

12:26.310 --> 12:27.877
No, I wasn't gonna do that.

12:27.921 --> 12:29.879
Malford's lawyers
would've just used it

12:29.923 --> 12:33.927
to-to call in to question
the evidence that I did find.

12:33.970 --> 12:35.363
I know how these people operate.

12:35.406 --> 12:39.671
Julia, that first report
is still evidence.

12:39.715 --> 12:41.456
You can't just destroy evidence

12:41.499 --> 12:43.066
because it doesn't
suit your needs.

12:43.110 --> 12:46.853
Okay, technically, that first
report was about an absence

12:46.896 --> 12:49.464
of evidence, which
isn't really evidence.

12:49.507 --> 12:51.031
Okay, all right.

12:51.074 --> 12:53.598
The bottom line is,
and-and I know

12:53.642 --> 12:56.036
you couldn't see the future
from where you were standing,

12:56.079 --> 12:58.342
you didn't do yourself
any favors.

12:58.386 --> 13:01.955
The D.A.'s office is gonna say
that you intentionally deleted

13:01.998 --> 13:04.609
that report
to make it easier for you

13:04.653 --> 13:06.046
to intentionally
plant the evidence.

13:06.089 --> 13:07.874
But that isn't what
actually happened.

13:07.917 --> 13:10.093
Even if it looks like
that's what happened.

13:10.137 --> 13:12.487
It really boils down to this:
either you made a mistake,

13:12.530 --> 13:15.490
or someone, quite possibly you,
is guilty of malfeasance.

13:15.533 --> 13:18.101
BENNY: Well, Danny's already
looking into malfeasance.

13:18.145 --> 13:21.626
She's trying to find anyone
with the means and motive

13:21.670 --> 13:22.976
to have switched out the hairs.

13:23.019 --> 13:26.849
Which in the meantime
leaves us with: mistake.

13:26.893 --> 13:28.851
As I've already explained
to you,

13:28.895 --> 13:31.419
I don't make
those kinds of mistakes.

13:31.462 --> 13:33.290
Well, then someone else did.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.816
In either event, we need
to follow chain of custody.

13:36.859 --> 13:40.820
I need to know everyone
who had access to that hair.

13:40.863 --> 13:42.909
Julia, can you talk
to my investigator,

13:42.952 --> 13:45.912
talk to her about how evidence
is catalogued and stored,

13:45.955 --> 13:47.783
who had access,
how they get access?

13:47.827 --> 13:49.393
Of course.Excellent.

13:49.437 --> 13:52.962
Well, then, Mr. Colón and I will
see you in court

13:53.006 --> 13:55.008
later this afternoon.

13:56.661 --> 13:58.489
Everything all right?

13:58.533 --> 14:00.535
I guess.

14:00.578 --> 14:03.886
I just realized I don't know
where to go.

14:03.930 --> 14:06.671
And what to do until court.

14:06.715 --> 14:09.761
You know, my first instinct
is to rush back to the morgue

14:09.805 --> 14:13.374
and then I remembered
that I can't.

14:19.684 --> 14:21.686
Not to worry.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.908
It is gonna be tough
to find jurors

14:25.952 --> 14:27.257
who aren't put off
by our client.

14:27.301 --> 14:28.911
Mm.

14:28.955 --> 14:32.872
Maybe we should look for people
who only see the best in others.

14:32.915 --> 14:36.049
Actually, I was thinking
just the opposite.

14:36.092 --> 14:39.095
What? People who
only see the worst?

14:39.139 --> 14:41.141
You ever heard
of Hanlon's razor?

14:41.184 --> 14:42.185
No.

14:42.229 --> 14:43.839
"Never attribute to malice

14:43.883 --> 14:46.668
that which is adequately
explained by stupidity."

14:46.711 --> 14:49.279
We need people who will
look at this situation

14:49.323 --> 14:53.109
Julia's gotten into and think,
"This isn't some big conspiracy.

14:53.153 --> 14:56.112
This is probably
just someone's stupid mistake."

14:56.156 --> 14:58.114
Good afternoon.

14:58.158 --> 15:02.205
So let's say you send
an e-mail to your boss

15:02.249 --> 15:03.903
asking him for time off.

15:03.946 --> 15:06.644
A day goes by
and he doesn't respond.

15:06.688 --> 15:08.037
What do you make of that?

15:08.081 --> 15:09.865
He's busy.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.475
I like her. Tell me
why I shouldn't.

15:11.519 --> 15:13.216
MARISSA:
Jennifer Thomas, single mom,

15:13.260 --> 15:17.046
43 years old, two kids and
you are going to hate this:

15:17.090 --> 15:20.136
she works at an insurance
company as a claims manager.

15:23.096 --> 15:25.054
Can I pick 'em
or can I pick 'em?

15:25.098 --> 15:28.405
Probably spends her days looking
at inflated insurance claims.

15:28.449 --> 15:30.973
She's the very definition
of what we don't want.

15:31.017 --> 15:32.714
We'd like to thank and excuse
this juror, Your Honor.

15:35.456 --> 15:37.414
Personally?

15:37.458 --> 15:40.156
I hate it when people
don't respond to my e-mails.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.766
Why is that?

15:41.810 --> 15:44.944
Well, they're trying to tell me
that I don't matter.

15:46.336 --> 15:48.295
I guess I figured
he didn't get the e-mail,

15:48.338 --> 15:50.471
or maybe he deleted it
by accident.

15:50.514 --> 15:53.474
Because anyone can make
an honest mistake, right?

15:53.517 --> 15:54.736
Sure.

15:57.043 --> 15:59.393
This juror's acceptable
to the defense, Your Honor.

15:59.436 --> 16:03.005
Then, ladies and gentlemen,
we have our jury.

16:03.049 --> 16:05.007
Trial will commence
tomorrow morning.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.226
Court is adjourned.

16:08.271 --> 16:10.360
This thing that you're doing,
it's not gonna work.

16:10.404 --> 16:13.233
I didn't make a mistake.
I don't make mistakes.

16:13.276 --> 16:16.149
You're making one now.

16:16.192 --> 16:18.499
DANNY: So you were the lab tech
on the Malford autopsies?

16:18.542 --> 16:20.153
It made my career. Julia's, too.

16:20.196 --> 16:22.329
I hear she's a tough boss.

16:22.372 --> 16:24.505
She's a little uptight.

16:24.548 --> 16:26.855
But honestly, that's what
you need around here.

16:26.898 --> 16:28.030
And who handled
the evidence

16:28.074 --> 16:29.205
besides Julia?

16:29.249 --> 16:30.641
No one.

16:30.685 --> 16:32.295
Really?

16:32.339 --> 16:35.211
Julia insisted
on doing it all herself.

16:35.255 --> 16:37.039
All of it?

16:37.083 --> 16:39.041
She was certified to test DNA?

16:39.085 --> 16:42.262
She's kind of a control freak.

16:42.305 --> 16:46.092
So she put the hair in the bag,
tested it, sealed it,

16:46.135 --> 16:48.311
signed it into the storage
locker all by herself?

16:49.878 --> 16:51.401
WILLIAMS:
Dr. Henson,

16:51.445 --> 16:53.664
you were
the defendant's supervisor

16:53.708 --> 16:55.318
during the Malford
investigation.

16:55.362 --> 16:58.060
There was a team of us
working on it,

16:58.104 --> 17:00.410
looking for something
of forensic value.

17:00.454 --> 17:02.586
And you didn't find anything,
did you?

17:02.630 --> 17:04.023
No.

17:04.066 --> 17:06.242
But then, something happened.

17:06.286 --> 17:10.507
Dr. Martin stayed on after
we completed the autopsy.

17:10.551 --> 17:12.988
A few hours later,
she notified me,

17:13.032 --> 17:15.121
said she found a hair.

17:15.164 --> 17:17.210
We were all stunned.

17:17.253 --> 17:18.689
Why?

17:18.733 --> 17:21.736
Well, we had searched every inch
of the victim's body.

17:21.779 --> 17:23.825
But you were pleased.Of course.

17:23.868 --> 17:25.305
We all wanted to put an end

17:25.348 --> 17:28.221
to this horrible string
of sexual attacks and murders.

17:28.264 --> 17:31.224
So you were proud of Dr. Martin?

17:31.267 --> 17:34.227
I was proud of our unit.

17:35.445 --> 17:38.013
I sense some hesitation
on your behalf

17:38.057 --> 17:40.015
with regard to Dr. Martin.

17:40.059 --> 17:43.323
She has always been
very diligent.

17:43.366 --> 17:44.715
Very determined.

17:44.759 --> 17:48.980
But frankly, she was
very hard on people.

17:49.024 --> 17:51.244
She could be quite arrogant.

17:53.507 --> 17:55.161
Thank you.

17:55.204 --> 17:56.684
Nothing further.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.560
Good morning, Dr. Henson.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.519
I just need you

18:05.562 --> 18:07.521
to clear something up.

18:07.564 --> 18:09.436
You know, in the whole time
that you ran

18:09.479 --> 18:13.875
the medical examiner's office,
you never once did complain

18:13.918 --> 18:17.096
about my client's job
performance, did you?

18:17.139 --> 18:19.663
Not in any
performance review,

18:19.707 --> 18:22.405
not even casually,
in a face-to-face with her, say,

18:22.449 --> 18:24.233
in your office?

18:24.277 --> 18:25.452
No.

18:25.495 --> 18:27.758
And isn't it true
that she replaced you?

18:27.802 --> 18:30.805
That she went from being your
subordinate to your supervisor?

18:30.848 --> 18:32.894
That's not how
I would describe it.

18:32.937 --> 18:35.549
Ah, well, how would
you describe it?

18:35.592 --> 18:39.379
I mean, uh, one day,
she's working for you,

18:39.422 --> 18:42.382
and the next day,
she's your boss.

18:42.425 --> 18:45.080
It stands to reason
that you probably harbor

18:45.124 --> 18:47.517
some resentment towards
Dr. Martin, wouldn't you say?

18:47.561 --> 18:48.779
Objection.

18:48.823 --> 18:50.781
Ask another question.

18:50.825 --> 18:54.916
I mean, she fired you.

18:54.959 --> 18:56.047
Didn't she?

18:56.091 --> 18:57.136
Objection.

18:57.179 --> 18:59.007
What's the relevance?

18:59.050 --> 19:00.791
It goes to bias, Your Honor.

19:00.835 --> 19:04.273
Dr. Henson is using this
courtroom to settle a score.

19:04.317 --> 19:06.188
JUDGE:
Overruled.

19:06.232 --> 19:07.668
Please answer the question.

19:07.711 --> 19:11.237
We had differences of opinion
on a number of cases.

19:11.280 --> 19:15.066
But she has the right to work
with whomever she chooses.

19:16.851 --> 19:21.029
I will admit that I did not like
the way she operated the unit.

19:21.072 --> 19:25.512
In my opinion,
she was obsessive.

19:25.555 --> 19:27.818
Determined to solve any
case, no matter what.

19:27.862 --> 19:32.127
Sometimes even if the forensics
did not bear her out.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.955
BENNY:
But again,

19:33.998 --> 19:36.392
that is your opinion.

19:36.436 --> 19:41.397
The opinion of the man she
replaced and ultimately fired.

19:43.486 --> 19:45.053
Just my opinion.

19:45.096 --> 19:47.621
No further questions,
Your Honor.

19:52.234 --> 19:53.714
This is the last of it.

19:53.757 --> 19:56.847
Every piece of information
about the hair that exists.

19:56.891 --> 19:59.328
Your original analysis,
your second analysis,

19:59.372 --> 20:03.027
the independent analysis,
photos, storage data.

20:08.729 --> 20:10.687
Anything jumping out at you?

20:10.731 --> 20:12.515
Not yet.

20:12.559 --> 20:14.691
I'm not trying to get out
of anything, but honestly,

20:14.735 --> 20:17.216
I have no idea
what I'm reading here.

20:17.259 --> 20:18.478
Just give it to me.

20:19.522 --> 20:21.524
You, too.
Give me yours.

20:29.967 --> 20:33.014
You don't have to sit here.
I don't need a babysitter.

20:36.147 --> 20:37.453
I'll be in my office.

20:37.497 --> 20:39.368
I'll be in my bed.

20:55.210 --> 20:57.125
Should I come back?

20:57.168 --> 20:59.301
Of course not. What's up?

20:59.345 --> 21:00.563
Pollen.

21:00.607 --> 21:02.522
Excuse me?

21:02.565 --> 21:04.785
The hair all the outside labs
have been testing

21:04.828 --> 21:07.091
is covered with pollen.

21:07.135 --> 21:09.442
And that matters because...?

21:09.485 --> 21:11.357
Well, to begin with,
it makes me wonder

21:11.400 --> 21:13.750
whether the hair is actually
a pubic hair at all.

21:13.794 --> 21:17.145
And if so, how it possibly
came into contact with pollen.

21:17.188 --> 21:20.540
Well, I'm sure,
with a little imagination,

21:20.583 --> 21:22.716
someone will come up
with a scenario.

21:22.759 --> 21:26.241
Emily was murdered
in the dead of winter.

21:27.982 --> 21:30.506
And in the dead of winter,
there is no pollen.

21:30.550 --> 21:35.511
This is not the hair
I found on Emily's body.

21:42.736 --> 21:44.128
CHUNK:
Dr. Martin,

21:44.172 --> 21:45.695
isn't it true that
the night that you

21:45.739 --> 21:49.177
found the sole piece of DNA
evidence against Mr. Malford,

21:49.220 --> 21:51.353
that everyone had gone home

21:51.397 --> 21:54.138
and you were completely alone
with the victim's body?

21:54.182 --> 21:56.750
Yes.And do you regularly

21:56.793 --> 21:58.969
perform autopsies alone,

21:59.013 --> 22:01.363
late at night, when everyone's
gone home for the day?

22:01.407 --> 22:02.625
Yes.

22:02.669 --> 22:04.497
And why is that?

22:04.540 --> 22:07.326
I have a really
particular skill set,

22:07.369 --> 22:09.371
and I find
that skill set works best

22:09.415 --> 22:11.330
when there's just two of us
in the room.

22:11.373 --> 22:13.680
Myself, and the cadaver.

22:13.723 --> 22:17.640
Other people really just end up
being distractions.

22:17.684 --> 22:20.382
All right.
Let's talk about that.

22:20.426 --> 22:22.558
When you say that other people
are distractions,

22:22.602 --> 22:26.083
it sounds very... negative.

22:26.127 --> 22:27.302
Very dismissive.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.912
One could easily get
the impression

22:28.956 --> 22:31.132
that you just don't like people.

22:31.175 --> 22:34.483
And we want the
jurors to like you.

22:34.527 --> 22:37.094
And it helps if they think
you might like them.

22:37.138 --> 22:40.359
I don't know them.

22:40.402 --> 22:41.664
Of course.

22:41.708 --> 22:46.408
Okay, um, let's forget
that line of thinking.

22:46.452 --> 22:48.976
Here's another reason
why saying you find

22:49.019 --> 22:52.196
other people distracting might
not serve your best interests:

22:52.240 --> 22:54.198
anything that makes it sound
like you don't like

22:54.242 --> 22:56.418
having people around
when you do your work

22:56.462 --> 22:58.420
might make the jurors
think that you don't

22:58.464 --> 23:01.205
want company because
it makes it harder

23:01.249 --> 23:03.512
to manipulate evidence.

23:05.209 --> 23:06.863
You see that, right?

23:06.907 --> 23:09.431
I don't manipulate evidence.I know that.

23:09.475 --> 23:11.955
But you're-you're talking
to people who don't know you.

23:11.999 --> 23:15.394
So how would you suggest
I answer that?

23:15.437 --> 23:19.223
Well, maybe there's another
reason you work late

23:19.267 --> 23:21.443
that wouldn't lead them
to the same conclusion.

23:21.487 --> 23:25.099
Maybe you find it
impossible to sleep

23:25.142 --> 23:26.448
when there are grieving
friends and relatives

23:26.492 --> 23:28.407
out there waiting for answers

23:28.450 --> 23:31.235
as to what happened
to their loved ones?

23:31.279 --> 23:34.413
I can't say that.
That's-that's not the truth.

23:34.456 --> 23:36.023
Maybe there's a truth

23:36.066 --> 23:39.069
that's more palatable
to the jury.

23:39.113 --> 23:44.466
Mr. Palmer, I'm a scientist,
and scientists deal with facts.

23:44.510 --> 23:48.078
There is one truth,
there's one right answer.

23:48.122 --> 23:52.474
If you ask me a question, I am
going to give you that truth.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.563
As to whether it's palatable,

23:54.607 --> 23:56.783
that's not something
I've ever concerned myself with.

23:56.826 --> 23:58.915
Well, it ought to be, because
you're gonna be spending

23:58.959 --> 24:01.483
ten years in prison for
something that you didn't do

24:01.527 --> 24:03.572
if we can't make the
jury understand

24:03.616 --> 24:05.226
your side of the story.

24:05.269 --> 24:07.794
Okay, again, there is
no "my side" of the story.

24:07.837 --> 24:09.186
There is what happened,

24:09.230 --> 24:11.450
and there is
what did not happen.

24:11.493 --> 24:15.018
There is truth and fact,
and there is falsehood.

24:15.062 --> 24:18.544
You can't spin the truth,
you cannot polish it up

24:18.587 --> 24:21.460
or put lipstick on a pig,
which is what I feel like

24:21.503 --> 24:22.722
you're trying to do
to me right now.

24:22.765 --> 24:24.463
I am what I am.

24:24.506 --> 24:26.595
I did what I did, and I don't
regret a minute of it

24:26.639 --> 24:30.512
because I did it
all by the book.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.993
So are we done here?

24:33.036 --> 24:36.257
It certainly seems that way.

24:36.300 --> 24:37.693
You talk to Chunk?Sure did.

24:37.737 --> 24:39.565
You still want to put her
on the stand?

24:39.608 --> 24:41.001
I do.

24:41.044 --> 24:42.916
He said that
she's fundamentally incapable

24:42.959 --> 24:45.527
of shading her answers
even one iota.

24:45.571 --> 24:48.399
Even at the risk of sending
herself to prison.

24:48.443 --> 24:50.358
I'm waiting for the bad news.

24:50.401 --> 24:52.578
I'm pretty sure I just
gave you the bad news.

24:52.621 --> 24:55.276
So the truth is, this woman
can't even fudge the facts

24:55.319 --> 24:56.973
to keep herself out of jail.

24:57.017 --> 24:59.541
Now we just have to get a jury
to understand that that means

24:59.585 --> 25:01.587
she couldn't possibly
have fudged them

25:01.630 --> 25:04.111
to put someone else behind bars.

25:04.154 --> 25:05.547
BENNY:
We've heard a lot

25:05.591 --> 25:08.681
about the fact
that you like to work alone

25:08.724 --> 25:10.683
and often late at night.

25:10.726 --> 25:12.554
Can you please tell us

25:12.598 --> 25:15.209
why that's your practice,
Dr. Martin?

25:15.252 --> 25:19.039
I'm not good with people.

25:20.736 --> 25:23.086
I know how
that sounds.

25:23.130 --> 25:25.393
Trust me, it's not made me
a lot of friends.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.702
But I am good
at my job.

25:29.745 --> 25:32.139
I'm great at my job.

25:32.182 --> 25:34.228
And in order to be
the best at my job,

25:34.271 --> 25:36.012
I have to be able
to concentrate.

25:36.056 --> 25:38.972
I have to know that every single
step of that process

25:39.015 --> 25:42.279
was done
with precision and care.

25:42.323 --> 25:44.934
And if I do every step myself,
I don't have to worry

25:44.978 --> 25:46.588
that it wasn't done properly.

25:46.632 --> 25:49.504
I don't have to worry

25:49.548 --> 25:51.985
that I offended someone
because I criticized them

25:52.028 --> 25:53.987
for making a mistake.

25:54.030 --> 25:55.597
Or that I forgot
to praise someone

25:55.641 --> 25:57.773
for just doing their job.

25:57.817 --> 26:02.430
So what do you say
to the allegations

26:02.473 --> 26:04.650
that you falsified evidence

26:04.693 --> 26:07.609
in order to get a conviction
against John Malford?

26:07.653 --> 26:10.003
I would say that's ridiculous.

26:10.046 --> 26:12.440
I don't care about John Malford.

26:12.483 --> 26:15.051
I have never cared
about who gets convicted.

26:15.095 --> 26:17.445
That's not
a win for me.

26:17.488 --> 26:20.230
A win for me is finding
the right answer.

26:20.274 --> 26:23.973
It's solving the puzzle,
it's making the crime stop.

26:24.017 --> 26:26.628
I do crosswords a lot.

26:26.672 --> 26:29.675
And they have
these new apps now.

26:29.718 --> 26:32.721
If you get stuck, you can prompt
it, and it'll give you a word,

26:32.765 --> 26:34.331
or it will give you a letter.

26:34.375 --> 26:37.465
And I would...
I would just never do that.

26:37.508 --> 26:40.120
I would never
want to do that,

26:40.163 --> 26:43.340
because having
a filled-out crossword,

26:43.384 --> 26:45.734
that does nothing for me.

26:45.778 --> 26:50.783
But solving it myself, that's
the part that's satisfying.

26:50.826 --> 26:55.657
So no, I would never falsify
evidence to get a conviction,

26:55.701 --> 26:59.182
because then I would
never really know who did it.

26:59.226 --> 27:01.707
I wouldn't solve the puzzle.

27:01.750 --> 27:05.754
If you cheat,
you never find the truth.

27:09.192 --> 27:10.759
Marissa?

27:10.803 --> 27:12.456
MARISSA:
No movement yet,

27:12.500 --> 27:14.894
but they clearly want
to believe her.

27:14.937 --> 27:17.592
Baby steps.

27:19.072 --> 27:22.641
I'm starting to think Chunk
doesn't know his own strength.

27:22.684 --> 27:24.425
Kept telling me she was
hopeless, but he actually

27:24.468 --> 27:27.646
turned her into
a very effective witness.

27:27.689 --> 27:32.346
Ah, speak of the devil.Oh...

27:32.389 --> 27:34.696
What have we here?

27:34.740 --> 27:36.611
TAYLOR:
Well,

27:36.655 --> 27:38.787
I wasn't able to connect Malford
directly to any of the people

27:38.831 --> 27:40.702
who worked at the medical
examiner's office,

27:40.746 --> 27:43.357
but then Danny had a great idea.DANNY: Serial killers

27:43.400 --> 27:45.576
like Malford tend to attract
obsessive fans.

27:45.620 --> 27:47.143
Total strangers who begin
to believe they have

27:47.187 --> 27:49.363
an intimate relationship
with these killers.

27:49.406 --> 27:51.365
Excessive adoration disorder.

27:51.408 --> 27:53.541
Oh, yeah.
I've heard of this.

27:53.584 --> 27:57.284
Crazy ladies who marry prisoners
they've never met before.

27:57.327 --> 27:59.678
Well, they're not all ladies
and they don't all get married,

27:59.721 --> 28:02.376
but yes, that's what
we're talking about.

28:02.419 --> 28:03.812
Malford hasn't had a
jailhouse wedding yet,

28:03.856 --> 28:06.293
but he does have
quite the fan club.

28:06.336 --> 28:08.599
TAYLOR: Our guy's gotten
thousands of letters,

28:08.643 --> 28:10.558
and he's responded
to hundreds of them.

28:10.601 --> 28:12.473
CHUNK: The good news is,
Sing Sing keeps a scan

28:12.516 --> 28:13.692
of all incoming
and outgoing mail,

28:13.735 --> 28:15.911
and they gave Taylor access.

28:15.955 --> 28:18.174
Any one of these admirers
sound like they'd be willing

28:18.218 --> 28:19.741
to help Malford
break out of prison?

28:19.785 --> 28:20.960
TAYLOR:
Oh, yeah.

28:21.003 --> 28:22.744
There's no shortage of those.

28:22.788 --> 28:25.094
But we're still talking
about over two dozen people.

28:25.138 --> 28:26.705
The math is not encouraging.

28:26.748 --> 28:28.532
More than 80 people had access

28:28.576 --> 28:30.578
to the evidence
storage facility.

28:30.621 --> 28:32.145
More than two dozen crazies
writing love letters.

28:32.188 --> 28:34.887
BENNY: That's a
lot of leads

28:34.930 --> 28:37.280
to be running down in
the middle of a trial.

28:37.324 --> 28:39.239
We don't have the time.

28:39.282 --> 28:40.893
I'm betting a day,
maybe two,

28:40.936 --> 28:44.113
before the judge forces
us to rest our case.

28:44.157 --> 28:46.899
Maybe we should just
go right to the source.

28:47.900 --> 28:49.510
Excuse me?

28:49.553 --> 28:51.860
See how early Benny and I
can get into Sing Sing tomorrow

28:51.904 --> 28:53.775
to talk with John Malford.

28:53.819 --> 28:56.778
Uh-- John Malford?
Seriously?

28:56.822 --> 28:59.868
Yeah. Sometimes the shortest
distance between two points

28:59.912 --> 29:01.478
is a straight line.

29:01.522 --> 29:03.829
We need to figure out
who's helping this guy

29:03.872 --> 29:07.484
break out of prison;
why don't we just go ask him?

29:16.232 --> 29:17.756
So what's
the game plan here, boss?

29:17.799 --> 29:19.845
I just want to look him
in the eye, see what I see.

29:19.888 --> 29:21.847
Maybe he'll offer something
useful, maybe he won't.

29:21.890 --> 29:24.501
Serial killers tend to be
outsized narcissists.

29:24.545 --> 29:27.113
Nothing they like to talk
about more than themselves.

29:27.156 --> 29:29.376
I just want to
get him talking.

29:33.206 --> 29:35.948
Ryan, good to see you.

29:35.991 --> 29:37.906
I didn't know you'd
be joining us.

29:37.950 --> 29:39.125
Benny, Dr. Bull, pleasure.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.998
When the prison informed me
you'd requested a meeting,

29:43.042 --> 29:44.783
I thought it wise to sit in.

29:44.826 --> 29:46.088
BULL:
Of course.

29:46.132 --> 29:47.916
Just to be clear,
this was all very last minute.

29:47.960 --> 29:50.092
Nobody's trying to
pull a fast one...

29:50.136 --> 29:51.920
Never even crossed my mind.

29:51.964 --> 29:54.009
Just want to be certain
everyone remembers,

29:54.053 --> 29:55.924
my client isn't on trial.

29:55.968 --> 29:57.230
Yours is.

29:57.273 --> 30:00.015
Oh, I think we're all
very clear about that.

30:02.017 --> 30:03.584
You must be Mr. Malford.

30:03.627 --> 30:05.629
Yeah. John.

30:05.673 --> 30:07.022
Who are you?

30:07.066 --> 30:08.110
RYAN: These are the
gentlemen representing

30:08.154 --> 30:09.677
the medical examiner

30:09.720 --> 30:11.853
who falsified the evidence
that got you locked up, John.

30:11.897 --> 30:13.246
Hmm.

30:13.289 --> 30:14.900
RYAN:
So...

30:14.943 --> 30:16.815
what can we do for you?

30:16.858 --> 30:18.381
Well, we just wanted
to get a look at the man

30:18.425 --> 30:20.557
who's at the center of our case.

30:20.601 --> 30:22.429
How you holding up
in here, John?

30:22.472 --> 30:24.605
Holding up good.

30:24.648 --> 30:27.782
Working out, food's okay.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.784
How's your head?

30:29.828 --> 30:32.656
You lonely?
You have any friends?

30:32.700 --> 30:34.920
Oh, yeah. I got friends.

30:34.963 --> 30:36.791
Inside and outside.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.619
BULL:
Aha.

30:38.662 --> 30:40.621
How do you mean, "outside"?

30:40.664 --> 30:41.883
Oh, you know.

30:41.927 --> 30:46.496
I get letters, pictures.
People want to visit.

30:46.540 --> 30:50.500
Want to, um, make friends.

30:50.544 --> 30:52.894
Women.
Mm.

30:52.938 --> 30:57.072
Oh. That sounds like a...
great life.

30:57.116 --> 31:00.641
Some of those pictures
are naked.

31:00.684 --> 31:02.948
RYAN: So, you two working
for the prison now?

31:02.991 --> 31:05.733
Hmm? Conducting a customer
satisfaction survey?

31:05.776 --> 31:07.996
The point is, John here's
been a model prisoner,

31:08.040 --> 31:10.042
he's adapted to prison life
flawlessly.

31:10.085 --> 31:13.567
Not a black mark on his record
to hinder his appeal.

31:13.610 --> 31:16.483
Ah. Right. John's appeal.

31:16.526 --> 31:18.920
Hey, I-I've got to ask,

31:18.964 --> 31:21.618
why even bother
with the appeal?

31:21.662 --> 31:23.751
You seem so content.

31:23.794 --> 31:25.100
Because he's innocent.

31:25.144 --> 31:27.146
JOHN:
What do I care

31:27.189 --> 31:30.149
if this guy wants to
push some papers around?

31:30.192 --> 31:31.411
No skin off my back.

31:31.454 --> 31:32.934
I mean, what's the worst
thing that happens?

31:32.978 --> 31:36.111
I actually... get out?

31:36.155 --> 31:38.984
You're right.

31:39.027 --> 31:40.724
No harm, no foul.

31:40.768 --> 31:44.293
This has been great.

31:44.337 --> 31:47.383
Really... helpful.

31:47.427 --> 31:49.168
Mr. Vance.

31:49.211 --> 31:51.387
Mr. Malford.

31:53.694 --> 31:55.870
Hey, why'd you cut bait
like that?

31:55.914 --> 31:57.959
The guy was just warming up.

31:58.003 --> 32:00.135
Maybe we could've gotten a name,

32:00.179 --> 32:02.311
maybe found our inside man
at the morgue.

32:02.355 --> 32:05.053
There is no name.

32:05.097 --> 32:06.750
There is no inside man
at the morgue.

32:06.794 --> 32:07.969
How do you mean?

32:09.971 --> 32:12.191
Did Malford seem like
he'd even contemplated

32:12.234 --> 32:13.714
life outside of prison?

32:13.757 --> 32:16.369
No. It didn't seem like

32:16.412 --> 32:18.937
he actually cared much
about his appeal at all.

32:18.980 --> 32:20.982
Exactly. He also showed
very little interest

32:21.026 --> 32:22.201
in Julia's case.

32:22.244 --> 32:24.420
Now, if this guy spent
the last six years

32:24.464 --> 32:27.858
hatching this scheme and
manipulating some admirer

32:27.902 --> 32:29.295
to do his bidding,
don't you think he'd be

32:29.338 --> 32:31.297
a little more invested
in the fruits of his labor?

32:31.340 --> 32:33.821
So, Malford didn't do it?

32:33.864 --> 32:36.084
Malford didn't change
the evidence?

32:36.128 --> 32:37.520
Back to square one?

32:37.564 --> 32:40.480
Maybe not.

32:40.523 --> 32:43.091
Malford might have no
interest in Julia's case,

32:43.135 --> 32:46.312
but someone put
this thing in motion.

32:46.355 --> 32:48.314
Who do you mean?

32:49.619 --> 32:51.752
Ryan? No.

32:51.795 --> 32:54.450
Ryan's his lawyer.
He's just doing his job.

32:54.494 --> 32:57.366
You don't think it strange
that he was there

32:57.410 --> 33:00.152
at that meeting just now,
or that he has been

33:00.195 --> 33:02.719
in court every day
of Julia's trial?

33:05.200 --> 33:06.375
I don't know, Bull.

33:06.419 --> 33:10.249
Ryan is not my favorite guy,

33:10.292 --> 33:13.121
but what does he care
if Julia goes down?

33:13.165 --> 33:15.254
I'm not sure.

33:15.297 --> 33:16.864
I'm just telling you
what I see.

33:23.088 --> 33:24.263
Since we moved off
the fangirl theory

33:24.306 --> 33:26.134
and onto Malford's lawyer,

33:26.178 --> 33:27.918
I circled back
to the 80 people

33:27.962 --> 33:29.833
who had access to the
evidence storage facility

33:29.877 --> 33:31.835
at the medical examiner's
office to see if I could

33:31.879 --> 33:33.402
try to find some
kind of link.

33:33.446 --> 33:35.839
We never did do a deep dive
into any of their finances,

33:35.883 --> 33:37.450
because Malford was broke,

33:37.493 --> 33:39.495
so it didn't seem
particularly relevant.

33:39.539 --> 33:43.499
But Malford's attorney,
Mr. Ryan Vance, Esquire, is not.

33:43.543 --> 33:45.197
He has plenty of money
to pay off

33:45.240 --> 33:46.981
an overworked,
underpaid lab tech.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.809
Like Skylar Brown.

33:48.852 --> 33:51.594
Skylar was wrestling with a
significant amount of debt.

33:51.638 --> 33:53.727
She maxed out four
credit cards and has

33:53.770 --> 33:55.294
two delinquent
homeowner loans.

33:55.337 --> 33:57.513
But, coincidentally,
Skylar seems to have had

33:57.557 --> 33:59.472
a financial windfall,

33:59.515 --> 34:01.126
just three weeks prior

34:01.169 --> 34:02.649
to the independent analysis
of Malford's hair.

34:02.692 --> 34:05.739
A cash deposit,
$60,000,

34:05.782 --> 34:07.262
straight into her
personal checking account.

34:07.306 --> 34:11.005
Hmm. Okay, $60,000 question.

34:11.049 --> 34:13.094
Can we tie any of this cash
back to Ryan Vance?

34:13.138 --> 34:15.618
Not yet, but we are
gonna keep at it.

34:16.967 --> 34:18.795
I feel the heat all
the way over here.

34:18.839 --> 34:20.101
Something not
clicking for you?

34:20.145 --> 34:24.062
I got everything but the "why."

34:24.105 --> 34:27.108
Why would a successful attorney
like Ryan Vance

34:27.152 --> 34:31.417
put his entire livelihood,
his entire legacy on the line

34:31.460 --> 34:35.247
for a rapist and a murderer
like John Malford?

34:35.290 --> 34:37.118
So...

34:37.162 --> 34:39.338
why frame Julia?

34:39.381 --> 34:41.557
Why go to all the trouble?

34:41.601 --> 34:43.951
Why risk putting
a homicidal sexual predator

34:43.994 --> 34:46.997
back on the street, earn
the enmity of the D.A.'s office

34:47.041 --> 34:51.915
by forcing them to reopen every
case where Julia's evidence

34:51.959 --> 34:53.961
put someone away?

34:56.137 --> 34:58.705
Why?

34:58.748 --> 35:00.968
What are you thinking?

35:01.011 --> 35:02.926
Taylor, how long
do you think it'd take

35:02.970 --> 35:05.668
to get a list
of Ryan Vance's other clients?

35:05.712 --> 35:08.149
The other clients that are
currently incarcerated?

35:08.193 --> 35:10.934
I'm kind of
in the middle of something...

35:10.978 --> 35:13.589
I don't care. I want that list.

35:13.633 --> 35:15.243
BENNY:
With Your Honor's approval,

35:15.287 --> 35:18.725
we'd like to call the person
sitting in the third row,

35:18.768 --> 35:22.598
John Malford's attorney
Ryan Vance, to the stand.

35:22.642 --> 35:24.426
JUDGE: Has the defense
subpoenaed Mr. Vance?

35:24.470 --> 35:25.862
We don't typically allow

35:25.906 --> 35:28.474
those seated in the gallery
to testify.

35:28.517 --> 35:30.084
Yes, we're aware of that,
Your Honor.

35:30.128 --> 35:32.217
But we're hoping
that the court will see fit

35:32.260 --> 35:34.349
to grant us this approval.RYAN: Your Honor,

35:34.393 --> 35:36.351
I'm sorry, I-- this is the first
I'm hearing of this.

35:36.395 --> 35:37.570
BENNY:
Mr. Vance's

35:37.613 --> 35:39.702
petition
for the independent analysis

35:39.746 --> 35:41.617
of the Malford
evidence

35:41.661 --> 35:43.228
initiated this whole trial.

35:43.271 --> 35:45.882
I'd merely like him to speak

35:45.926 --> 35:49.277
to the history of how
that new analysis came to be.

35:50.757 --> 35:53.281
All right. I'll allow it.

35:53.325 --> 35:56.589
BENNY: So Mr. Vance,
when you requested

35:56.632 --> 35:58.591
an independent examination
of the evidence

35:58.634 --> 36:02.377
in the John Malford case,
did you know a negative match

36:02.421 --> 36:06.076
would call into question
the professional conduct

36:06.120 --> 36:09.167
and scientific expertise
of my client,

36:09.210 --> 36:11.299
Dr. Julia Martin?

36:11.343 --> 36:12.953
That would be
a natural consequence.

36:12.996 --> 36:15.347
She did perform
the original analysis.

36:19.568 --> 36:21.788
Isn't it true

36:21.831 --> 36:25.183
that other cases will be
reexamined as a result

36:25.226 --> 36:27.707
of Dr. Martin's prosecution?

36:27.750 --> 36:31.972
Countless other criminals,
murderers, rapists and thieves

36:32.015 --> 36:34.453
are going to file for dismissal
of their sentences.

36:34.496 --> 36:37.195
As well they should be, yes.

36:37.238 --> 36:42.809
Ah. I-Isn't it also true
that you are the sole owner

36:42.852 --> 36:48.162
of Barnaby Bank
account number 00403010?

36:48.206 --> 36:50.556
I don't know, I...
It very well could be.

36:50.599 --> 36:52.166
I don't have
my account number memorized.

36:52.210 --> 36:56.518
I do bank at Barnaby,
so yes, I suppose.

36:56.562 --> 37:01.219
A-And isn't it also true that
you withdrew $60,000 in cash

37:01.262 --> 37:03.525
on September 21st
from this account?

37:03.569 --> 37:05.832
Again, it's months ago.

37:05.875 --> 37:07.312
I don't have
every transaction memorized,

37:07.355 --> 37:10.053
so yes, it's possible,
it sounds possible.

37:10.097 --> 37:12.926
If you say so.

37:12.969 --> 37:15.015
Well, it's not me saying it.

37:15.058 --> 37:16.712
Your Honor,

37:16.756 --> 37:19.585
these are Mr. Vance's
bank records

37:19.628 --> 37:22.283
for the month of September.

37:22.327 --> 37:26.026
I'd ask that you mark them

37:26.069 --> 37:28.115
as defense exhibit
number 14.

37:28.158 --> 37:29.725
So marked.

37:29.769 --> 37:34.164
And lastly,
do you know a Skylar Brown?

37:34.208 --> 37:36.471
RYAN:
Uh...

37:36.515 --> 37:39.518
Uh, name rings a bell.
I-I can't be certain, though.

37:39.561 --> 37:41.998
Well, she's an employee
of the medical examiner's office

37:42.042 --> 37:45.828
with full access
to all evidence storage.

37:45.872 --> 37:48.744
Including DNA samples.Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance?

37:48.788 --> 37:51.138
I'm moments away,
Your Honor, I promise.

37:51.181 --> 37:53.271
I certainly hope so. Overruled.

37:53.314 --> 37:54.663
Isn't it strange

37:54.707 --> 37:58.493
that just two days after
you made your withdrawal,

37:58.537 --> 38:01.104
Skylar Brown paid off
all of her credit cards,

38:01.148 --> 38:04.107
her delinquent loans?

38:04.151 --> 38:06.849
All of her
outstanding debts?

38:06.893 --> 38:11.898
Following a deposit
of exactly $60,000 in cash

38:11.941 --> 38:13.682
into her
checking account?

38:13.726 --> 38:17.817
I wouldn't say strange.
I might say coincidental.

38:17.860 --> 38:20.254
Ah.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.038
How old were you
when your brother

38:22.082 --> 38:23.388
was convicted of murder?

38:26.869 --> 38:28.828
I really don't think
that has anything to do

38:28.871 --> 38:30.395
with the business at hand.

38:30.438 --> 38:35.051
I-Isn't your brother Trevor
one of your clients?

38:35.095 --> 38:40.274
And wasn't the evidence in his
case also assessed by my client,

38:40.318 --> 38:42.624
Dr. Julia Martin?

38:42.668 --> 38:45.323
And if Dr. Martin
is found guilty,

38:45.366 --> 38:48.151
isn't Trevor's conviction
likely to be overturned,

38:48.195 --> 38:50.328
just like John Malford's?

38:50.371 --> 38:52.112
And isn't that
why you paid

38:52.155 --> 38:56.812
Skylar Brown $60,000,

38:56.856 --> 38:58.205
to replace the hair
that was used

38:58.248 --> 39:01.251
to convict your client,
John Malford?

39:05.343 --> 39:07.127
JUDGE:
Mr. Vance,

39:07.170 --> 39:09.172
do you need
the question repeated?

39:11.305 --> 39:13.394
Oh, that's all right,
Your Honor.

39:13.438 --> 39:16.441
I think the jury already has
their answer.

39:16.484 --> 39:18.181
No further questions.

39:22.621 --> 39:25.580
Is the prosecution prepared
to cross-examine the witness?

39:30.324 --> 39:32.631
Actually, no.

39:34.110 --> 39:37.766
But we are prepared,
based on Ryan Vance's testimony

39:37.810 --> 39:41.291
and the evidence presented
by Mr. Colón,

39:41.335 --> 39:42.641
to withdraw our charges

39:42.684 --> 39:44.643
against Dr. Martin...

39:46.253 --> 39:47.950
...and offer our apologies.

39:58.657 --> 40:01.399
Thank you.You're welcome.

40:20.243 --> 40:24.552
Oh, Dr. Martin, it's 2:00 in the
morning, and I heard a noise.

40:24.596 --> 40:27.990
No one else is here, you know,
and I was just about to leave.

40:28.034 --> 40:29.905
You gonna be okay?

40:29.949 --> 40:32.908
I'm going to be perfect.
