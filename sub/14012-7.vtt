You got benefit tickets?
Circus, maybe?

00:19.353 --> 00:21.053
How many you want me to buy?

00:21.055 --> 00:22.454
Hey, is he offering
us a bribe?

00:22.456 --> 00:25.090
What the hell are you
trying to do to me?

00:25.092 --> 00:27.426
Come here!
Hey, you cops!

00:35.469 --> 00:39.104
We punctured through
this sub-partition wall.

00:39.106 --> 00:41.373
One of the guys freaks.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.175
Sees this.

00:45.112 --> 00:47.446
COP:
Could be an animal.

00:52.486 --> 00:54.386
Yeah.

00:54.388 --> 00:59.124
An animal that walks
on two legs and talks.

00:59.126 --> 01:01.527
Call it in, Reni.

01:01.529 --> 01:03.228
Now.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.399
Young-- eight, nine.

01:07.401 --> 01:08.400
What happened?

01:08.402 --> 01:10.536
The kid crawl in and fall?

01:10.538 --> 01:12.137
Massive
skull fracture.

01:12.139 --> 01:14.139
It doesn't
sound like a fall.

01:14.141 --> 01:17.142
Yeah, more likely hit...
and not a love tap.

01:17.144 --> 01:19.278
So, boy? Girl? What?

01:19.280 --> 01:22.548
Male. My guess:
Nine years old.

01:22.550 --> 01:25.551
He had a "J.F.K.
For President" button

01:25.553 --> 01:27.152
on his jacket.

01:27.154 --> 01:30.622

Give or take.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.345
Who kills
a nine-year-old?

03:00.347 --> 03:02.581
Kids fighting,
something happens.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.249
Some pervert waving
his flag? Who knows?

03:04.251 --> 03:07.252
When it's dead kids,
it's usually mom or pop.

03:07.254 --> 03:10.389
Before '74 that building
was owned by a corporation.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.324
Out of business,
no rent roll.

Missing persons?

03:16.263 --> 03:17.396
Worth a shot.

03:17.398 --> 03:18.931
Take hand lotion.

03:18.933 --> 03:20.265
Paper cuts.

03:20.267 --> 03:22.801
No computers before '74.

03:22.803 --> 03:27.272
All missing children,
1958 to 1964.

03:27.274 --> 03:28.807
That's a lot
of kids.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.409
You think
that's a lot?

03:30.411 --> 03:32.945
Take any two years
from the '80s--

03:32.947 --> 03:34.846
that many
and then some.

03:34.848 --> 03:36.848
What happened
to them?
I tell you one thing.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.717
They didn't fly
out the window

03:38.719 --> 03:41.353
with Tinkerbell
and Peter Pan.

Time to call
the psychics.

Keep reading.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.309
After six hours

04:04.311 --> 04:07.312
I don't even know
what we're looking for.

04:07.314 --> 04:09.848
Do you want a Danish
or a cruller?

04:09.850 --> 04:11.383
You look at these

04:11.385 --> 04:13.852
you think people
misplace their kids

04:13.854 --> 04:16.722
like they lose umbrellas.

04:16.724 --> 04:20.659
Get me a Danish,

Who were the detectives
on the case?

04:47.855 --> 04:52.991
Sergeant Dominick McFadden
and Detective Joe Shelby.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.326
Terrific.

04:54.328 --> 04:56.361
It's an old case of yours.

04:56.363 --> 04:58.964
Tony Dececco
I saw in the papers.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.899
His brother got whacked.

05:08.375 --> 05:11.777
Fell on the concrete steps
when he was six.

05:11.779 --> 05:14.346
It sounds like
you just read
the file.

05:14.348 --> 05:16.348
You ever do
a missing kid?

05:16.350 --> 05:18.350
My partner Shelby
retired to Florida.

05:18.352 --> 05:21.353
Once, twice a year,
he used to call about it.

05:21.355 --> 05:22.921
Couldn't let it alone.

05:22.923 --> 05:23.922
Good detective.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.357
Prostate cancer.

05:25.359 --> 05:27.392
Only 68.

05:27.394 --> 05:28.927
Case alive again?

05:28.929 --> 05:30.362
We found the kid.

05:30.364 --> 05:33.398
LOGAN:
Bones in the basement
of a building.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.933
Same block
the kid lived on.

05:34.935 --> 05:37.936
Yeah, we figured somebody
in the neighborhood.

05:37.938 --> 05:40.405
You got a gay couple
in the file?

05:40.407 --> 05:42.808
My notes should
have been in there.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.810
Two guys-- 30s, 40s.

05:44.812 --> 05:46.511
They lived on the block.

05:46.513 --> 05:49.047
Connors, Conway,
something like that.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.382
The other guy...

05:50.384 --> 05:51.883
some German name.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.485
Couldn't make the case?

05:53.487 --> 05:54.453
No.

05:54.455 --> 05:55.854
His father was dead.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.456
You find the mother?

05:57.458 --> 05:59.458
Yeah, she was a teacher.

High school, West Side.

06:20.381 --> 06:22.147
Fort Lee, New Jersey.

06:28.088 --> 06:30.055
When Tommy disappeared

06:30.057 --> 06:31.490
that was hard,

06:31.492 --> 06:34.493
but do you know
what was even harder?

06:34.495 --> 06:36.461
When I gave up hope.

06:36.463 --> 06:38.997
Every once in a while

06:38.999 --> 06:42.000
I figure out how old he'd be.

06:42.002 --> 06:44.002
What would he be doing?

06:44.004 --> 06:46.405
Married, maybe.

06:46.407 --> 06:48.840
Kids of his own.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.509
My grandchildren.

06:50.511 --> 06:53.412
Do you remember
who lived at 583?

06:53.414 --> 06:55.814
It's been a long time.

06:58.519 --> 07:01.420
About that day...?

07:02.456 --> 07:05.023
I was getting
my master's degree.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.458
I left class.

07:06.460 --> 07:08.460
I went to get Tommy.

07:08.462 --> 07:10.495
He was in the schoolyard.

07:10.497 --> 07:14.499
He said he was going
to play with his friends.

07:14.501 --> 07:17.002
I didn't give him a kiss.

07:17.004 --> 07:20.539
I didn't want to embarrass him.

07:20.541 --> 07:23.608
I never saw him again.

07:24.878 --> 07:28.013
Did anybody walk him home
that day?

07:32.019 --> 07:36.021
Hospitals,
and all the kids' parents

07:36.023 --> 07:39.524
the police... I called.

07:39.526 --> 07:42.461
It took me years to move.

07:42.463 --> 07:45.030
I wanted to be there.

07:45.032 --> 07:47.566
He might come home.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.073
Mrs. Keegan...

07:57.478 --> 08:01.646
the two men
who lived on that block...?

08:01.648 --> 08:03.648
The ones the police suspected?

08:03.650 --> 08:05.584
Did they do it?

08:05.586 --> 08:07.586
Do you remember
their names?

08:07.588 --> 08:09.221
No.

08:09.223 --> 08:12.591
I thought I'd never forget them,

08:12.593 --> 08:15.627
but after a while I realized

08:15.629 --> 08:19.130
if you keep remembering,
you can't live.

08:20.567 --> 08:22.067
LOGAN:
Yeah, yeah.

08:22.069 --> 08:23.602
Thanks.

08:24.638 --> 08:27.072
No reverse phone directories

08:27.074 --> 08:30.542
If we're gonna find out who
lived in that building

08:30.544 --> 08:34.546
we're going to have to knock
on a lot of doors.

08:34.548 --> 08:36.515
Yeah, you have an address?

08:36.517 --> 08:37.949
Thank you.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.117
Okay.

08:39.119 --> 08:42.587
1962, Con Ed had one account
in the building.

08:42.589 --> 08:44.689
Now there's a different address.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.057
Still active.

08:46.059 --> 08:48.093
Carl Lawler, Perry Street.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.628
It was our first apartment.

08:49.630 --> 08:50.996
God, it was small.

08:50.998 --> 08:52.597
Barely room for a bed.

08:52.599 --> 08:54.633
The police came that night.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.735
We were at work.
We couldn't tell them anything.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.737
Who else lived
in the building?

08:58.739 --> 09:00.705

Nice couple
in the duplex.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.073
They had

You knew them, honey.

09:03.610 --> 09:04.943
Yeah, he was in insurance.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.211
Messimer, Catherine Messimer.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.079
I don't remember his name.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.248
What about the other
apartment on your floor?

09:10.250 --> 09:13.652
Uh... Dorfman and Conover.

09:13.654 --> 09:14.653
Not married?

09:14.655 --> 09:16.655
Two men, a couple.

09:16.657 --> 09:20.091
We wondered, but we
thought it was awful to
suspect them at first.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.627
Have you seen them since?

09:22.629 --> 09:25.997
Harold House, the publisher--
that's where they worked.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.699
Ed Conover was an editor.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.701
They used to bring us
books sometimes...

09:29.703 --> 09:31.703
I don't know
how you'd find them now.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.972

do you remember him?

10:59.292 --> 11:01.660
For years after he disappeared,

11:01.662 --> 11:05.263
I was afraid to go outside

Just looking at the picture,
I felt sick

11:49.376 --> 11:51.376
thinking how Tommy died.

11:51.378 --> 11:54.779
Everybody assumed...
I mean

11:54.781 --> 11:57.115
it was logical
he was murdered.

11:57.117 --> 12:00.819
Wasn't he?

12:00.821 --> 12:03.488
Why are you
asking about him now?

12:03.490 --> 12:07.492
We found his remains
in the basement of the
building you grew up in.

12:07.494 --> 12:08.893
Oh, my God.

12:08.895 --> 12:11.463
Can you remember
anything

12:11.465 --> 12:12.497
about that day?

12:12.499 --> 12:14.766
The police talked to me

12:14.768 --> 12:16.768
after he disappeared.

12:16.770 --> 12:19.471
We must have played together.

12:19.473 --> 12:21.339
I'm sure I saw him,

12:21.341 --> 12:23.341
but it's very long ago.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.910
CERRETA:
Did you know
the two men

12:25.912 --> 12:28.213
who lived on the fourth floor
of that building?

12:28.215 --> 12:30.515
Their names were Dorfman
and Conover.

12:30.517 --> 12:33.985
I'm sorry...

12:35.355 --> 12:39.390
I think
they gave Tommy some books.

12:39.392 --> 12:41.459
Do you think your
parents might remember?

12:41.461 --> 12:46.998
They moved out of the city to
Harrison; they bought a house.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.300
In the basement?

12:49.302 --> 12:51.302
No wonder she fainted.

12:51.304 --> 12:54.239
CATHERINE:
Maybe we should
call her.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.809
It was terrible.

12:57.811 --> 13:00.545
You realized it could be
your own child.

13:00.547 --> 13:03.281
Yes.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.849
The couple upstairs...

13:04.851 --> 13:06.284
Oh, the Lawlers.

13:06.286 --> 13:09.888
Carl and...
what was her name?

13:09.890 --> 13:10.889
Julia? Jane?

13:10.891 --> 13:12.824
The other couple.

13:12.826 --> 13:14.259
In those days

13:14.261 --> 13:16.261
we didn't call them
a couple.

13:16.263 --> 13:18.863
We wouldn't want
to speak ill of them

13:18.865 --> 13:20.999
the way they were,
but...

13:21.001 --> 13:22.901
Tell them, Thad.

13:22.903 --> 13:25.570
Well, six months later,
the younger one...

13:25.572 --> 13:28.439
what was
his name?

13:28.441 --> 13:30.975
Conover, Ed.

13:30.977 --> 13:34.579
THAD:
He worked
for a youth group.

13:34.581 --> 13:37.282
A church on 93rd.

13:37.284 --> 13:39.851
St. Lucius.

13:39.853 --> 13:41.820
Uh...

13:41.822 --> 13:44.823
we heard...

13:44.825 --> 13:47.926
he approached a boy.

13:47.928 --> 13:50.361
The boy
who made the accusation--

13:50.363 --> 13:53.098
he was trouble.

13:53.099 --> 13:55.834
I felt he was... he'd heard
about the other incidents,

13:55.836 --> 13:57.836
was wanting attention.

13:57.838 --> 14:00.438
So you think Conover
was innocent?

14:00.440 --> 14:02.907
In the case of the missing boy?

14:02.909 --> 14:04.442
He was never charged.

14:04.444 --> 14:07.545
My understanding of the law,
that makes him innocent.

14:07.547 --> 14:11.616
Reverend, why don't you
try not to judge us.
Save us a little trouble.

14:11.618 --> 14:14.285
He was a good counselor
to those kids,

14:14.287 --> 14:16.888
but in most people's eyes--
a lot of them--

14:16.890 --> 14:19.023
he was automatically guilty.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.025
Are you still in touch
with him?

14:21.027 --> 14:22.460
30 years ago

14:22.462 --> 14:24.863
suspicion almost destroyed
Conover's life.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.498
Do you want to put him
through that again?

14:27.500 --> 14:29.367
If he's guilty,
yes, I do.

14:29.369 --> 14:30.935
And if he's innocent?

14:30.936 --> 14:32.502
As you said, he
survived it once.

14:32.505 --> 14:36.407
Three blocks away--
Carrington nursing home.

14:36.409 --> 14:39.978
But you did know
the Keegan kid?

14:39.980 --> 14:42.947
You think I don't know
what you're thinking?

14:42.949 --> 14:45.450
All gays molest kids.

14:45.452 --> 14:46.918
I think you will find

14:46.920 --> 14:49.454
cops know most child molesters
are straight.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.623
Why don't you help us out?

14:51.625 --> 14:53.958
I don't have to tell
you one damn thing.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.593
No, you don't,
but we could get a subpoena.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.896
And I'd get a lawyer.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.497
Let's talk about the basement...

14:59.499 --> 15:02.634
You want the truth?

15:02.636 --> 15:04.969
Tommy...

15:04.971 --> 15:08.106
we took him down there,
tortured him, killed him.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.974
Used to do one a week.

15:09.976 --> 15:12.543
You're a laugh riot,
Mr. Conover.

15:12.545 --> 15:15.980
You know what else
isn't funny? You.

15:15.982 --> 15:17.115
Go to hell!

15:21.054 --> 15:23.388
Seventy? Last time
we did one that old

15:23.390 --> 15:25.556
it was a Nazi for the I.N.S.

15:25.558 --> 15:28.026
I'd say this one'd be
about as easy to convict.

15:28.028 --> 15:29.994
You got his name
on the ace of spades?

15:29.996 --> 15:32.697
He had access to the basement,
and he knew the Keegan kid.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.532
We mentioned him
to Julie Atkinson.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.367
She got a funny look
on her face.

15:36.369 --> 15:37.635
She fogged all up.

15:37.637 --> 15:40.004
So you saying she knows
that he killed the kid

15:40.006 --> 15:41.706
but she's trying
to protect him?

15:41.708 --> 15:43.441
Why? How did
Conover react?

15:43.443 --> 15:45.610
LOGAN:
Told us
to go to hell.

15:45.612 --> 15:48.446
Well, at least he's got a way
with words. Ideas?

15:48.448 --> 15:51.582
Let's see what Atkinson comes up
with, place him at the scene.

15:51.584 --> 15:54.452
Thanks.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.955
I don't understand.
The case must be closed by now.

15:56.957 --> 16:00.491
There's no statute
of limitations on homicide.

16:00.493 --> 16:03.528
But you told me you didn't know
if it was murder.

16:03.530 --> 16:06.130
That's why we'd like you to come
down, spend a couple hours

16:06.132 --> 16:07.532
going over everything
that happened.

16:07.534 --> 16:10.435
You know, a lead can come
from anywhere.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.704
I'm sorry.

16:12.706 --> 16:15.006
It's a busy time of year.

16:15.008 --> 16:17.108
Okay.

16:17.110 --> 16:20.611
Kid's been dead
for 30 years.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.983
One more abandoned case.

16:24.985 --> 16:28.987
Nobody really cares now
except the mother.

16:28.989 --> 16:31.589
Thanks, anyway.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.599
Me? I can't contact her.

16:41.601 --> 16:42.767
It's improper.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.502
We pushed her.
It didn't work.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.637
It's not only improper,
it's ineffective.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.106
The woman has to trust me.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.108
I'll tell you something,
if we don't get Conover

16:50.110 --> 16:53.544
we can bury those bones
and the case along with it.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.446
Logan, woman asking
for you.

16:59.419 --> 17:00.752
Hey...

17:03.590 --> 17:05.757
You said I could help.

17:05.759 --> 17:07.158
Yeah.

17:07.160 --> 17:10.061
Listen,
thanks for coming by.

17:10.063 --> 17:13.131
There's someone
I'd like you to meet.

17:16.603 --> 17:20.171
Ms. Atkinson,
this is Dr. Olivet.

17:20.173 --> 17:23.608
She's a police department
psychiatrist.

17:23.610 --> 17:26.611
Hi.

17:26.613 --> 17:29.047
Hi.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.899
For the first hour

17:30.900 --> 17:32.750
she didn't remember
even seeing the boy.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.485
LOGAN:
What about Conover?

17:34.487 --> 17:35.620
Nothing.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.722
She has this recurrent image--

17:37.724 --> 17:39.590
red and blue.

17:39.592 --> 17:40.825
She came back to it twice,

17:40.827 --> 17:42.827
but doesn't know
what it means.

17:42.829 --> 17:45.129
What was the Keegan kid wearing?

17:45.131 --> 17:49.267
Green shirt, khakis,
black sneakers.

17:49.269 --> 17:52.236
How screwed up is she?

17:52.238 --> 17:54.138
I'd say severely.

17:54.140 --> 17:56.841
And she said
she never saw a shrink?

17:56.843 --> 17:59.844
She also said she's basically
a happy person.

17:59.846 --> 18:02.180
What about hypnosis?

18:02.182 --> 18:05.483
Unreliable. And almost
impossible to get
admitted in court.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.852
Well... not if she doesn't
implicate herself.

18:07.854 --> 18:10.855
If she gives us a lead
and we corroborate it

18:10.857 --> 18:13.324
we don't need her in court.

18:13.325 --> 18:15.792
Yeah, but if we put her under,
and then we end up needing her

18:15.795 --> 18:18.496
we'll never get her
on the stand.

18:18.498 --> 18:19.697
She coming back?

18:19.699 --> 18:20.832
We opened a vein.

18:20.834 --> 18:22.733
She might want to close it.

18:22.735 --> 18:25.203
Maybe, maybe, maybe.

18:25.205 --> 18:28.873
My feeing:
She wants to know.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.809
Any idea what
this red and blue is?

18:31.811 --> 18:33.845
Your guess is as good as mine.

18:37.150 --> 18:38.149
Red and blue?

18:38.151 --> 18:39.217
You're joking.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.152
investigation
In a murder

18:41.154 --> 18:43.154
I don't go for laughs.

18:43.156 --> 18:45.123
It could be
anything--

18:45.125 --> 18:47.859
clothes, toys,
the American flag.

18:47.861 --> 18:50.628
The day the boy was missing

18:50.630 --> 18:52.230
do you remember

18:52.232 --> 18:55.199
if anything unusual
happened to Julie?

18:55.201 --> 18:56.634
An ordinary night.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.636
I had a P.T.A. meeting.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.572
I came home from work
and put Julie to bed.

19:01.574 --> 19:02.874
She had a cold.

19:02.876 --> 19:05.776
If you could persuade her
to talk to us again...

19:05.778 --> 19:07.145
We...

19:07.147 --> 19:10.715
I... I don't know
if we could convince her.

19:10.717 --> 19:13.818
Our psychiatrist feels
Julie may know something,

19:13.820 --> 19:15.653
though not consciously.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.922
We're not telling Julie
to do something

19:17.924 --> 19:20.858
she doesn't want to do.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.693
Dad says I had a cold?

19:22.695 --> 19:24.262
I'm sure he's right.

19:24.264 --> 19:26.764
Beautiful plants, orchids,

19:26.766 --> 19:29.267
but they need a lot of care.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.702
Maybe you could give
us another hour?

19:31.704 --> 19:35.573
Detective, if you could say an
eight-year-old has a boyfriend,

19:35.575 --> 19:36.641
mine was Tommy.

19:36.643 --> 19:37.808
But I can't help you.

19:37.810 --> 19:41.179
Julie, the red and the blue
you mentioned...

19:41.181 --> 19:43.281
You asked me
to meet with Dr. Olivet.

19:43.283 --> 19:44.749
I did.

19:44.751 --> 19:47.285
Mrs. Atkinson,
a little boy died.

19:47.287 --> 19:48.920
30 years ago.

19:48.922 --> 19:49.954
That's right.

19:49.956 --> 19:52.590
But what if it
had been yesterday?

19:52.592 --> 19:54.592
CERRETA:
Do us a favor?

19:54.594 --> 19:55.893
Will you try again?

19:55.895 --> 19:57.962
Just one more shot.

20:00.300 --> 20:03.834
OLIVET:
<i> the day he disappeared?Tommy</i>

20:03.836 --> 20:06.971
On the way home
from school.

20:06.973 --> 20:10.708
And then
you started walking?

20:10.710 --> 20:12.310
I hid the candy.

20:12.312 --> 20:17.715
'Cause Daddy didn't like me
to eat them before dinner.

20:17.717 --> 20:21.319
Tommy had a baseball--
no, a football--

20:21.321 --> 20:23.721
and he kept
throwing it to Ed.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.341
Conover was with you?

20:26.342 --> 20:28.960
No, he was just sitting on the
stoop when we got to the house.

20:28.962 --> 20:30.728
I hated that.

20:30.730 --> 20:31.996
What did you hate?

20:31.998 --> 20:34.298
When he'd sit
on the stoop.

20:34.300 --> 20:38.002
I'd always have to
walk around him.

20:38.004 --> 20:39.770
Did he say anything?

20:39.772 --> 20:42.306
No, he just...

20:42.308 --> 20:44.008
I don't know.

20:44.010 --> 20:47.011
It... it made me
feel creepy

20:47.013 --> 20:48.746
and uncomfortable.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.448
And then what happened?

20:50.450 --> 20:52.817
JULIE:
We went into the house.

20:57.323 --> 21:01.859
My room... was right over here.

21:06.266 --> 21:09.767
My toy chest was always
by the door.

21:09.769 --> 21:13.771
Do you remember
having dinner that night?

21:13.773 --> 21:16.040
My mom probably
left something.

21:16.042 --> 21:18.509
She always did
when she wasn't home.

21:18.511 --> 21:22.046
And then you got sick,
and you went to bed.

21:22.048 --> 21:24.048
My pajamas
were always hanging

21:24.050 --> 21:26.450
on the back of the door.

21:28.388 --> 21:31.789
I had to go
to the bathroom.

21:31.791 --> 21:36.060
I wanted
to brush my teeth.

21:36.062 --> 21:38.396
Yeah, the bathroom...

21:38.398 --> 21:41.299
was right down here.

21:50.343 --> 21:53.010
Oh...

21:53.012 --> 21:55.313
no.

21:55.315 --> 21:58.316
Oh, my God.

21:58.318 --> 22:00.084
What is it, Julie?

22:00.086 --> 22:02.820
Oh... oh...

22:02.822 --> 22:05.823
the blue and the red.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.825
What's blue and red?

22:07.827 --> 22:09.393
The sweater.

22:09.395 --> 22:11.829
What sweater?

22:11.831 --> 22:14.832
Daddy's sweater.

22:14.834 --> 22:18.402
He's washing it out
here in the tub,

22:18.404 --> 22:23.474
and it's all covered
with blood.

22:30.116 --> 22:32.683
A daughter,
some bones in a basement

22:32.685 --> 22:33.751
and that's it?

22:33.753 --> 22:35.686
I'll bet anything
Dad's a kinko.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.021
ROBINETTE:
And no record.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.490
The shrink believes
the daughter.

22:39.492 --> 22:40.591
Indict him.

22:40.593 --> 22:42.793
Maybe he wets his pants
and confesses.

22:42.795 --> 22:45.596
And maybe he hits the city
with a false arrest charge,

22:45.598 --> 22:47.698
and the attorney general
has to settle with him.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.433
LOGAN:
I'm Messimer.

22:49.435 --> 22:52.470
I got a 65-year-old wife,
a daughter not talking to me.

22:52.472 --> 22:54.572
I'm possibly facing
25 years to life.

22:54.574 --> 22:56.006
What do I do?

22:56.008 --> 22:57.575
You go to Costa Rica

22:57.577 --> 23:00.544
and drink piña coladas
with 20-year-old bimbos.

23:00.546 --> 23:01.645
Pick him up.

23:01.647 --> 23:03.447
Take his passport.

23:07.453 --> 23:10.087
I'm going to talk
with Olivet.

23:10.089 --> 23:13.557
I'm not saying she's a picture
of mental health.

23:13.559 --> 23:15.459
She's not committable?

23:15.461 --> 23:17.461
From what I can tell

23:17.463 --> 23:21.599
this father jerked
this woman around like a yo-yo.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.601
He bartered affection.

23:23.603 --> 23:26.837
He controlled her like a robot,
but she's functional.

23:26.839 --> 23:29.607
Building a case on her...

23:29.609 --> 23:32.476
it's a thin tight rope;
no net.

23:32.478 --> 23:33.577
I've been wrong.

23:33.579 --> 23:34.879
Not this time.

23:34.881 --> 23:37.481
Do you want to take
a pass on this?

23:37.483 --> 23:39.150
Not if he did it.

23:39.152 --> 23:40.885
She's telling the truth.

23:40.887 --> 23:42.153
And as a witness?

23:42.155 --> 23:44.889
The jury might
not believe her.

23:44.891 --> 23:46.757
What are we talking about?

23:46.759 --> 23:48.893
She'll fall apart on the stand?

23:48.895 --> 23:52.530
Anything's possible.

23:52.532 --> 23:54.532
STONE:
We're just trying
to make you understand

23:54.534 --> 23:56.167
that being a witness
won't be easy.

23:56.169 --> 23:58.803
Being me isn't easy,
witness or otherwise.

23:58.805 --> 24:00.571
Please, Mrs. Atkinson.

24:00.573 --> 24:02.072
Pretend you're the jury.

24:02.074 --> 24:03.541
What do you see?

24:03.543 --> 24:05.709
A child attacking her parents.

24:07.079 --> 24:10.748
ROBINETTE:
How long have you been
estranged from them?

24:10.750 --> 24:13.584
When I was 28,
I moved to Chicago.

24:13.586 --> 24:14.685
I got married.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.454
I got divorced.

24:16.456 --> 24:17.688
I came home.

24:17.690 --> 24:20.458
My father said, "I told you so."

24:20.460 --> 24:21.892
Then I moved
to San Francisco.

24:21.894 --> 24:22.893
I got married.

24:22.895 --> 24:23.928
I got divorced

24:23.930 --> 24:25.663
and I came home

24:25.665 --> 24:27.531
and my father said

24:27.533 --> 24:30.534
"When are you going to learn
to listen to me?"

24:30.536 --> 24:33.604
Two years ago--
the last time I came home--

24:33.606 --> 24:35.706
I stopped talking to my father.

24:35.708 --> 24:37.675
I didn't know why then.

24:37.677 --> 24:40.578
Now I'm beginning
to understand it all.

24:40.580 --> 24:42.613
My concern is not only for you.

24:42.615 --> 24:45.816
We prosecute your father,
it falls apart,

24:45.818 --> 24:47.651
we look irresponsible.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.687
I told you. I'll testify.

24:49.689 --> 24:53.123
You're going to be portrayed
in the media and the courtroom

24:53.125 --> 24:56.227
as an unhappy, overwrought,
vindictive daughter.

24:56.229 --> 24:59.630
Maybe I'm not the happiest
person in the world.

24:59.632 --> 25:01.932
Maybe I won't be.

25:03.669 --> 25:05.703
But I'll survive.

25:15.248 --> 25:17.281
She imagined this, Mr. Stone.

25:17.283 --> 25:19.717
STONE:
We're obliged
to investigate.

25:19.719 --> 25:21.986
At the expense
of my client's reputation.

25:21.988 --> 25:24.522
This man has led
an exemplary life.

25:24.524 --> 25:27.191
Or he hasn't
and nobody caught him.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.893
You people can't believe

25:28.895 --> 25:31.595
I killed
an eight-year-old child.

25:31.597 --> 25:34.732
We do love our daughter,
but Julie's had difficulties.

25:34.734 --> 25:38.702
you're risking a suit
If this gets out of hand,

25:38.704 --> 25:40.804
for malicious prosecution.

25:40.806 --> 25:43.307
If we feel we have a case,
we have to take the risk.

25:43.309 --> 25:45.609
What about the risk to Julie?

25:45.611 --> 25:48.746
What's happening here
is an abuse of the system,

25:48.748 --> 25:50.714
an abuse of your office

25:50.716 --> 25:53.183
and an abuse of my daughter.

25:53.185 --> 25:55.819
And an abuse of a child--
Tommy Keegan.

25:55.821 --> 25:57.755
Thad...

25:57.757 --> 26:00.691
If I read about this
in the papers...

26:00.693 --> 26:02.726
if you try to smear me...

26:02.728 --> 26:04.695
THAD:
Catherine.

26:12.305 --> 26:14.738
Try to keep it
out of the papers.

26:14.740 --> 26:18.809
A civil suit could be very messy
in an election year.

26:21.747 --> 26:23.581
What have you got?

26:23.583 --> 26:25.583
Genuine Life and Casualty.

26:25.585 --> 26:26.884
He got fired.

26:26.886 --> 26:28.786
They won't discuss it.

26:28.788 --> 26:31.655
I'll have Adam talk with them.

26:31.657 --> 26:34.325
You doubting he killed the kid?

26:36.362 --> 26:39.697
If I did,
I'm doubting a lot less.

26:39.699 --> 26:43.801
ROBINETTE:
<i> Vice president back then.</i>

26:43.803 --> 26:46.337
You must have been
pretty young.

26:46.339 --> 26:48.806
How well did
you know Messimer?

26:48.808 --> 26:50.674
You understand,
this is off
the record.

26:50.676 --> 26:53.344
Subpoena me--
I won't repeat
it under oath.

26:53.346 --> 26:55.245
I don't want to be sued.

26:55.247 --> 26:56.680
Messimer.

26:56.682 --> 27:00.618
Not a water-cooler man.

27:00.620 --> 27:02.319
Kept to himself.

27:02.321 --> 27:04.288
But you fired him
personally?

27:04.290 --> 27:06.690
Couple of meetings,
major clients.

27:06.692 --> 27:08.859
You couldn't see it, but...

27:08.861 --> 27:12.262
let's just say the mints
didn't cover the smell.

27:12.264 --> 27:14.365
He kept getting jobs.

27:14.367 --> 27:16.367
Some men drown in booze.

27:16.369 --> 27:18.702
Some swim in it.

27:18.704 --> 27:20.671
Who knew him well?

27:20.673 --> 27:22.039
He had a buddy.

27:22.041 --> 27:23.741
Gil Lindon.

27:23.743 --> 27:26.110
Fired him, too.

27:26.112 --> 27:29.647
Well, I mean, you know,
they never said fired.

27:29.649 --> 27:31.715
I mean, not to
your face, no.

27:31.717 --> 27:34.284
They called it
mutual termination.

27:34.286 --> 27:36.954
Tell me, is Messimer
in trouble, huh?

27:36.956 --> 27:39.423
Was his
a mutual termination, too?

27:39.425 --> 27:42.760
That man could sell
fire insurance to Eskimos,

27:42.762 --> 27:45.829
even putting away three
or four at lunch.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.998
He have any other problems?

27:48.000 --> 27:49.733
What do they say?

27:49.735 --> 27:51.735
"Too late we grow smart."

27:51.737 --> 27:53.003
We drank.

27:53.005 --> 27:56.006
I took the 12 Steps
out of the bar.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.741
It's history.

27:57.743 --> 27:59.877
Grow smart now, Mr. Lindon.

28:01.881 --> 28:03.781
Tell me something.

28:03.783 --> 28:06.016
What did Messimer do?

28:06.018 --> 28:07.951
Kids?

28:10.723 --> 28:13.891
You know, right before
we were mutually terminated

28:13.893 --> 28:16.827
we were coming back
from a client--

28:16.829 --> 28:18.896
train station, Stamford--

28:18.898 --> 28:21.899
Thad goes into the can,
doesn't come back.

28:21.901 --> 28:23.901
I go in after him.

28:23.903 --> 28:25.903
There's a cop in there.

28:25.905 --> 28:27.938
Some kid, 14, 15...

28:27.940 --> 28:31.909
says, uh...
Messimer made a pass.

28:32.878 --> 28:34.044
It gives you motive.

28:34.046 --> 28:36.046
He molested Tommy,
then killed him.

28:36.048 --> 28:37.915
The Connecticut record
still there?

28:37.917 --> 28:39.049
Sealed.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.451
Get it unsealed.

28:40.453 --> 28:41.919
Charges were dropped.

28:41.921 --> 28:44.054
I sent up
a show-cause order.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.923
Boy's name, Joseph Kelley.

28:45.925 --> 28:48.492
He's an administrator
at Mercy Hospital.

28:48.494 --> 28:50.127
Go see him.

28:50.930 --> 28:52.830
It wasn't just him.

28:52.832 --> 28:54.932
I must have given him
the eye.

28:54.934 --> 28:57.935
I probably wanted him
to come on to me.

28:57.937 --> 29:00.070
The case never went
to trial.

29:00.072 --> 29:02.372
My parents suspected
I was gay.

29:02.374 --> 29:04.141
It comes out I'm hanging
around the station

29:04.143 --> 29:06.443
the neighbors hear
about it, well...

29:06.445 --> 29:09.079
So they said
you wouldn't testify.

29:09.081 --> 29:11.982
When I was in my 20s,
I went to a shrink.

29:11.984 --> 29:15.085
He said guys like that--
it's not about sex.

29:15.087 --> 29:16.820
It's about power.

29:16.822 --> 29:20.491
Lots of them don't even care
if it's boys or girls.

29:20.493 --> 29:22.960
Just somebody
they could control.

29:22.962 --> 29:27.397
Mr. Kelley, do you remember
exactly what Messimer did?

29:27.399 --> 29:28.966
Offered me 20 bucks.

29:28.968 --> 29:30.834
I almost said yes.

29:30.836 --> 29:33.170
Something in his eyes.

29:33.172 --> 29:35.839
Even a kid can tell.

29:35.841 --> 29:39.510
When I turned him down,
he got real upset.

29:39.512 --> 29:41.512
He grabbed my arm.

29:41.514 --> 29:43.514
Said, "50 bucks."

29:43.516 --> 29:46.984
The more I said no,
the crazier he looked.

29:46.986 --> 29:48.852
Yes, well,
that's all very interesting

29:48.854 --> 29:51.055
and useless at trial.

29:51.056 --> 29:53.257
Messimer wasn't convicted
of anything.

29:53.259 --> 29:55.125
I'll bring it in somehow.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.927
What? Pattern crime?

29:56.929 --> 29:59.446
It's not even close.

29:59.447 --> 30:01.964
Even if he had been convicted,
this isn't Palm Beach.

30:01.967 --> 30:03.967
You can't use previous history

30:03.969 --> 30:06.236
and without it,
you can't prove motive.

30:06.238 --> 30:09.072
They've got to open
the character issue.

30:09.074 --> 30:11.008
Then we can
bring in Kelley.

30:11.010 --> 30:13.443
Messimer's reputation as a
totally respectable citizen--

30:13.445 --> 30:15.012
it's their only card.

30:15.014 --> 30:17.881
What's the operating
principle here?

30:17.883 --> 30:19.149
Doug Greer's a fool?

30:19.151 --> 30:20.918
Messimer is stupid?

30:20.920 --> 30:22.986
Guaranteed he told Doug
about this.

30:22.988 --> 30:25.556
They're not going to bring in
any character witnesses?

30:25.558 --> 30:27.090
He won't
defend himself.

30:27.092 --> 30:29.927
20 to 1, he never tries
to make a case.

30:29.929 --> 30:33.030
How many times he did it
we'll never know about.

30:33.032 --> 30:36.567
Maybe you molest once
and never again, but twice?

30:36.569 --> 30:38.101
It's a compulsion.

30:38.103 --> 30:40.103
We've got to nail him.

30:40.105 --> 30:42.105
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

30:42.107 --> 30:44.908
Let me have that,
will you?

30:44.910 --> 30:46.276
Thanks.

30:46.278 --> 30:48.045
Yeah?

30:49.048 --> 30:51.014
Mm-hmm.

30:51.016 --> 30:54.051
Yes.

30:54.053 --> 30:55.185
It's Olivet.

30:55.187 --> 30:56.987
Mother got to Julie.

30:56.989 --> 30:59.289
She doesn't want
to testify.

31:07.166 --> 31:09.967
Liz, can you bring her in?

31:12.938 --> 31:15.005
Okay, two hours.

31:15.007 --> 31:17.007
I know what I told you.

31:17.009 --> 31:18.542
I made a mistake.

31:18.544 --> 31:20.611
And what did
your mother say?

31:20.613 --> 31:22.946
My memories
must be mixed up.

31:22.948 --> 31:24.948
She says my father loves me

31:24.950 --> 31:27.584
and can't believe
I'm doing this to him.

31:27.586 --> 31:29.653
(<i> knocking</i> )

31:35.961 --> 31:38.562
STONE:
You two may remember
each other.

31:42.534 --> 31:44.167
Mrs. Keegan.

31:45.137 --> 31:47.571
You look wonderful, Julie.

31:50.242 --> 31:51.975
Mrs. Keegan, I...

31:51.977 --> 31:54.111
I need your help.

31:54.113 --> 31:56.647
I can't.

31:56.649 --> 31:58.215
He killed Tommy.

31:58.217 --> 32:01.051
OLIVET:
Julie, your father
can't hurt you anymore.

32:01.053 --> 32:05.022
The only power he has over you
is the power you give him.

32:05.024 --> 32:06.623
Please.

32:14.667 --> 32:17.935
Docket #45721,<i> The People v.</i>
<i> Thaddeus Messimer.</i>

32:17.937 --> 32:20.938
The charge is murder
in the second degree.

32:20.940 --> 32:24.041
Is the defendant
ready to enter a plea?

32:24.043 --> 32:25.542
Not guilty.

32:25.544 --> 32:28.078
JUDGE:
Mr. Robinette?

32:28.080 --> 32:30.147
Your Honor, the defendant's
economic situation allows

32:30.149 --> 32:32.549
for the real possibility
of flight.

32:32.551 --> 32:35.152
The People request $500,000 bail

32:35.154 --> 32:38.555
and that the defendant
surrender his passport.

32:38.557 --> 32:39.723
Your Honor,
the prosecutor's information

32:39.725 --> 32:42.659
is so, shall we say, perfunctory

32:42.661 --> 32:45.228
the People's request
seems extreme.

32:45.230 --> 32:46.697
Mr. Greer,

32:46.699 --> 32:50.067
your client will surrender
his passport to the clerk.

32:50.069 --> 32:53.570
Your Honor, we have
no objection, but
in that case, bail...

32:53.572 --> 32:57.140
$300,000-- half in cash,
half secured bond.

32:57.142 --> 32:58.275
Next.

32:58.277 --> 33:00.010
This has gone too far.

33:00.012 --> 33:01.578
The case is preposterous, Ben.

33:01.580 --> 33:04.181
Anybody could have
broken into that house.

33:04.183 --> 33:05.615
Wait a minute.

33:05.617 --> 33:08.986
You kill a child,
drag him to a stranger's house

33:08.988 --> 33:10.587
stick him in a wall?

33:10.589 --> 33:12.622
I'm filing a motion
for dismissal.

33:12.624 --> 33:14.591
We're presenting
to the grand jury.

33:14.593 --> 33:15.726
I'll file to quash.

33:15.728 --> 33:20.564
My daughter...
is a lovely, sweet woman

33:20.566 --> 33:23.033
who is very disturbed.

33:23.035 --> 33:24.668
Don't make her worse.

33:24.670 --> 33:27.037
Stop manipulating her,
maybe she'll feel better.

33:27.039 --> 33:29.673
And disturbed or not,
a jury will believe her.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.775
Do you know what a trial
does to this man's life?

33:31.777 --> 33:33.243
Spare him the horror.

33:33.245 --> 33:34.544
Manslaughter one.

33:34.546 --> 33:35.746
Eight and 1/3 to 25.

33:35.748 --> 33:37.147
You can't be serious.

33:37.149 --> 33:38.682
A 30-year-old crime?

33:38.684 --> 33:41.618
A case that doesn't dignify
the word "evidence"?

33:41.620 --> 33:44.588
Doug, there is nothing dignified
about this case.

33:44.590 --> 33:47.024
Not the evidence, not the crime,
not the defendant.

33:51.163 --> 33:52.729
Your key witness--

33:52.731 --> 33:54.598
I wouldn't count on her.

33:54.600 --> 33:57.601
You know where she took
her summer vacation last year?

33:57.603 --> 34:01.038
Bellevue-- the
psychiatric ward.

34:04.176 --> 34:05.609
Every word--

34:05.611 --> 34:07.177
your memories,

34:07.179 --> 34:09.179
your attitude
towards your parents--

34:09.181 --> 34:10.814
all of it comes
into question.

34:10.816 --> 34:12.315
I'm sorry.

34:12.317 --> 34:14.785
A psychiatric ward
is embarrassing.

34:14.787 --> 34:16.270
A trial can be
embarrassing,

34:16.271 --> 34:17.754
and not just to
your father, to you.

34:17.756 --> 34:19.790
I can handle it.

34:19.792 --> 34:21.158
It was a transient episode, Ben.

34:21.160 --> 34:22.793
She was there three weeks.

34:22.795 --> 34:24.327
The jury hears words

34:24.329 --> 34:27.764
like "paranoia,"
"suicidal depression"?

34:27.766 --> 34:30.267
They are there to be judgmental.

34:30.269 --> 34:33.103
My breakdown helped me.

34:33.105 --> 34:36.173
Everything I kept inside
started to come out.

34:36.175 --> 34:39.142
Julie, if there is
anything else, he should know.

34:39.144 --> 34:40.677
And for your sake.

34:40.679 --> 34:43.814
My father's on trial, not me.

34:43.816 --> 34:46.149
The credibility
of your testimony

34:46.151 --> 34:47.651
is what is on trial.

34:47.653 --> 34:51.855
All my secrets are out,
Mr. Stone,

34:51.857 --> 34:54.691
and my parents' too.

35:00.866 --> 35:03.867
The skull had a lateral inline
fracture 12 centimeters long.

35:03.869 --> 35:06.837
Could that have been caused
by a fall, an accident?

35:06.839 --> 35:09.773
No, the skull was hit directly
by a heavy object.

35:09.775 --> 35:11.108
Thank you.

35:11.110 --> 35:12.375
Your witness.

35:12.377 --> 35:14.711
Mr. Houston, if a boy crawled
inside a wall,

35:14.713 --> 35:16.713
and an ordinary red brick--

35:16.714 --> 35:18.714
like the ones found
near the bones you examined--

35:18.717 --> 35:20.383
if a brick fell
eight or ten feet

35:20.385 --> 35:22.652
could it leave a fracture
like the one you described?

35:22.654 --> 35:24.221
It's possible, but...
Thank you.

35:24.223 --> 35:25.456
No further questions.

35:25.457 --> 35:26.690
Possible,
but extremely unlikely.

35:26.692 --> 35:28.758
No further questions.

35:29.862 --> 35:33.430
MRS. KEEGAN:
He never really had
much of a father.

35:33.432 --> 35:36.766
Tommy was only four
when my husband died.

35:36.768 --> 35:40.837
Did your son have a relationship
with the defendant?

35:40.839 --> 35:45.809
I worried about the lack
of a father figure for Tommy,

35:45.811 --> 35:48.245
so... I was happy to...

35:48.247 --> 35:50.881
to see Thad befriend Tommy.

35:50.883 --> 35:54.885
What did you personally witness

35:54.887 --> 35:58.889
of your son's relationship
with the defendant?

35:58.891 --> 36:01.909
Thad would

36:01.910 --> 36:04.928
tap him on the head and tell him
he was big and strong

36:04.930 --> 36:07.697
grow up
to be a football player.

36:07.699 --> 36:11.234
He took him to a Giants game
once with his daughter.

36:11.236 --> 36:15.906
Tommy came home with one
of the players' autographs.

36:15.908 --> 36:17.941
Thank you.
No further questions.

36:19.912 --> 36:22.212
Mrs. Keegan,

36:22.214 --> 36:24.714
did you tell the police

36:24.716 --> 36:27.918
about Mr. Messimer's
relationship with your son?

36:27.920 --> 36:29.219
No.

36:29.221 --> 36:30.687
Why?

36:30.689 --> 36:32.856
It didn't seem unusual to you?

36:32.858 --> 36:35.458
No.

36:35.460 --> 36:38.261
What made you change your mind?

36:38.263 --> 36:42.966
Well, nothing made me
change my mind.

36:42.968 --> 36:45.502
Did Tommy ever complain to you

36:45.504 --> 36:47.804
after he spent time
with Mr. Messimer?

36:47.806 --> 36:49.906
Did he seem troubled?
Moody?

36:49.908 --> 36:52.542
No.
Did you have a
close relationship

36:52.544 --> 36:54.978
with your son?
Did he confide in you?

36:54.980 --> 36:58.281
As much as children do.

36:58.283 --> 37:00.250
Thank you.
No further questions.

37:00.252 --> 37:03.820
Wait. You're trying
to make this seem as... as...

37:03.822 --> 37:04.821
Your Honor?

37:04.823 --> 37:06.556
The witness is excused.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.458
But I trusted Thad.

37:08.460 --> 37:10.293
I had no idea that...

37:10.295 --> 37:11.761
Mrs. Keegan, please.

37:11.763 --> 37:14.297
Step down.

37:14.299 --> 37:17.834
Repression is a well-understood
psychological mechanism.

37:17.836 --> 37:19.970
Memories too painful to bear

37:19.972 --> 37:22.305
are excluded
from conscious awareness.

37:22.307 --> 37:24.941
Can you explain
the appearance of memories

37:24.943 --> 37:27.310
after being repressed
for so many years?

37:27.312 --> 37:28.878
As a person grows up

37:28.880 --> 37:33.316
and is psychologically capable
of coping with a painful event

37:33.318 --> 37:34.918
the memories break through.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.420
Thank you.
No further questions.

37:37.422 --> 37:40.991
Dr. Olivet, don't we often
think we remember things

37:40.993 --> 37:44.327
that never happened?

37:44.329 --> 37:46.263
Sometimes,
but repressed memories

37:46.265 --> 37:49.466
of traumatic events
are usually accurate.

37:49.468 --> 37:51.968
Are you familiar with the work

37:51.970 --> 37:54.871
of a psychiatrist
named Abraham Trigonis?

37:54.873 --> 37:56.906
Yes.

37:56.908 --> 37:58.959
Tell the court

37:58.960 --> 38:01.011
Dr. Trigonis' theory
of childhood memories.

38:01.013 --> 38:05.582
Dr. Trigonis believes that many
adult memories of childhood

38:05.584 --> 38:09.819
are to some extent an amalgam
of fantasy and wish fulfillment.

38:09.821 --> 38:10.987
And yet you just said

38:10.989 --> 38:12.589
adult memories of childhood are
accurate.

38:12.591 --> 38:14.591
What I said was
repressed memories

38:14.593 --> 38:16.593
of traumatic events
are accurate.

38:16.595 --> 38:20.030
Especially when remembering
brings on a new trauma.

38:20.032 --> 38:21.431
Repressed memories.

38:21.433 --> 38:22.932
Adult memories.

38:22.934 --> 38:25.935
Well, it's certainly confusing
and abstract to me.

38:25.937 --> 38:28.505
No further questions.

38:28.507 --> 38:29.806
This is blackmail.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.374
No, this is your meeting.

38:31.376 --> 38:32.976
To spare his daughter
further suffering,

38:32.978 --> 38:35.378
Mr. Messimer
will consider a plea

38:35.380 --> 38:36.980
with the record sealed.

38:36.982 --> 38:41.918
Well, I'm sure Mr. Messimer
knows all about sealed records.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.019
Don't force this, Ben.

38:43.021 --> 38:44.854
I'll demolish that
woman on the stand.

38:44.856 --> 38:48.458
Oh, I get it. He cares about
her, but you'll demolish her.

38:48.460 --> 38:51.361
Criminally negligent
homicide-- he does no time.

38:51.363 --> 38:53.830
No time for killing a child?

38:53.832 --> 38:56.433
Who's blackmailing whom?

38:56.435 --> 38:57.867
Manslaughter one.

38:57.869 --> 38:59.369
Same offer.

38:59.371 --> 39:01.371
I love my daughter,

39:01.373 --> 39:06.076
but I'm not going to prison
for a crime I didn't commit.

39:09.514 --> 39:11.481
OLIVET:
<i> She'll be here. Relax.</i>

39:11.483 --> 39:14.884
She falls apart on
the stand she'll blow us
right out of the water.

39:14.886 --> 39:17.520
What do you think
she does to herself?

39:17.522 --> 39:20.090
Her breakdown was, what,
a year ago?

39:20.092 --> 39:23.360
Let's just hope this doesn't
give her another one.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.068
Are you okay?

39:32.070 --> 39:33.970
My father was waiting
for me last night

39:33.972 --> 39:36.106
on the street in
front of my building.

39:36.108 --> 39:38.408
He begged me
not to say anything.

39:38.410 --> 39:41.111
He told me it would
be better for me.

39:41.113 --> 39:43.113
Not him--<i> me.</i>

39:43.115 --> 39:45.115
All those years,
and I wondered

39:45.117 --> 39:46.883
what was wrong with me.

39:50.989 --> 39:52.155
I'll be okay.

39:57.496 --> 40:00.597
STONE:
And why did you seek
psychiatric help?

40:00.599 --> 40:02.132
I was depressed.

40:02.134 --> 40:04.401
I had thoughts of suicide.

40:04.403 --> 40:08.004
Were you ever hospitalized
for emotional problems?

40:08.006 --> 40:10.006
About a year ago,
for three weeks.

40:10.008 --> 40:12.542
I suffered
from paranoid delusions.

40:12.544 --> 40:14.110
Do you still suffer from them?

40:14.112 --> 40:15.912
No.

40:15.914 --> 40:17.180
Mrs. Atkinson,

40:17.182 --> 40:19.649
please tell us what happened

40:19.651 --> 40:22.752
the day
Tommy Keegan disappeared.

40:22.754 --> 40:26.156
Tommy and I left school together

40:26.158 --> 40:28.658
and stopped
at a corner candy store,

40:28.660 --> 40:30.660
and then we started home.

40:30.662 --> 40:35.965
Mom was at work, and my dad
was waiting at the front door.

40:35.967 --> 40:39.536
And what else do you recall?

40:39.538 --> 40:43.072
I didn't feel well,
so I went to bed early.

40:43.074 --> 40:46.543
My dad brought me some warm
milk, and I fell asleep.

40:46.545 --> 40:49.746
But I woke up
to go to the bathroom,

40:49.748 --> 40:52.048
and I wanted to brush my teeth.

40:52.050 --> 40:56.119
So I went down the hall,
and the bathroom door was ajar.

40:58.790 --> 41:01.958
I heard water running.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.461
(<i> breathing tensely</i> )

41:04.463 --> 41:08.097
I pushed the
door open...

41:11.703 --> 41:13.203
and I saw...

41:16.541 --> 41:18.675
I saw...

41:18.677 --> 41:21.144
What did you see?

41:27.519 --> 41:29.018
My dad...

41:31.523 --> 41:34.157
was kneeling at the tub

41:34.159 --> 41:38.728
and he was washing out
a blue sweater.

41:38.730 --> 41:42.565
The sweater was all bloody

41:42.567 --> 41:46.236
and his hands were bloody.

41:46.238 --> 41:50.139
I said, "Daddy,
did you hurt yourself?"

41:50.141 --> 41:55.778
I wanted him to tell me
that everything was all right.

41:55.780 --> 41:57.714
And what did he do?

41:57.716 --> 42:00.216
He turned to me...

42:02.120 --> 42:04.621
Blood was smeared on his face

42:04.623 --> 42:06.789
and he had a look

42:06.791 --> 42:09.626
like he was going to hit me.

42:09.628 --> 42:12.795
He looked like a monster
in a movie

42:12.797 --> 42:15.732
with his eyes all bulged out.

42:15.734 --> 42:18.201
Did he say anything?

42:19.271 --> 42:22.272
I don't remember anything
after that.

42:24.276 --> 42:25.742
Thank you.

42:27.579 --> 42:29.546
Your witness.

42:30.181 --> 42:33.316
Prior to the past two months,
Mrs. Atkinson,

42:33.318 --> 42:36.152
when did you last
see your parents?

42:36.154 --> 42:37.654
Two years ago.

42:37.656 --> 42:38.821
Two years.

42:38.823 --> 42:40.256
A long time.

42:40.258 --> 42:43.092
Did your parents
treat you badly?

42:43.094 --> 42:48.064
I didn't see them because
it was painful to talk to them.

42:48.066 --> 42:49.299
Oh, why?

42:49.301 --> 42:51.868
Do you feel
they don't love you?

42:51.870 --> 42:53.703
No, I'm sure they do.

42:53.705 --> 42:55.488
With your testimony

42:55.489 --> 42:57.272
are you trying to get back at
them for some reason?

42:57.275 --> 42:59.208
Objection.
Maybe you made this

42:59.210 --> 43:01.077
whole thing up just to get their
attention?

43:01.079 --> 43:02.278
Sustained.

43:02.280 --> 43:04.881
Mr. Greer, that's enough
along those lines.

43:04.883 --> 43:06.883
Move on to
something else.

43:06.885 --> 43:09.786
Didn't you recall the
testimony you gave today,

43:09.788 --> 43:12.088
only with the help
of a psychiatrist

43:12.090 --> 43:14.190
who works for the police
department in New York City?

43:14.192 --> 43:15.858
I just took a walk with her.

43:15.860 --> 43:17.794
You just took a walk,

43:17.796 --> 43:21.197
and suddenly you remember
what happened 31 years ago.

43:21.199 --> 43:24.300
Did your Bellevue delusions
include images of blood?

43:24.302 --> 43:25.735
No.
Or bathtubs?

43:25.737 --> 43:27.203
Your father trying
to hurt you?

43:27.205 --> 43:28.237
You don't understand.

43:28.239 --> 43:30.540
I understand.

43:30.541 --> 43:32.842
I understand that you've
always resented your father

43:32.844 --> 43:34.611
because he tried to tell you
some hard truths

43:34.613 --> 43:36.713
which you didn't want to hear,
now isn't that the truth?

43:36.715 --> 43:38.781
My father and I...

43:38.783 --> 43:41.751
Oh, come one, come on,
come on, come on.

43:44.923 --> 43:47.757
Didn't your father forbid you to
see a boy in high school

43:47.759 --> 43:50.293
who subsequently
made you pregnant?

43:50.295 --> 43:54.831
In fact, hasn't
your whole life
been a disaster?

43:54.833 --> 43:57.233
Divorces, abortions...

43:57.235 --> 43:58.234
Your Honor!

43:58.236 --> 43:59.769
Mr. Greer...

44:03.174 --> 44:04.307
No more questions.

44:13.385 --> 44:17.954
GREER:
<i> He doesn't want her</i>
<i> on the stand again.</i>

44:17.956 --> 44:20.256
My heart goes out to him.

44:20.258 --> 44:23.826
Tomorrow, on redirect,

44:23.828 --> 44:27.864
I'm asking Julie if he
told her not to testify.

44:27.866 --> 44:29.265
I'll object.

44:29.267 --> 44:31.401
He tampered with
a witness, Doug.

44:31.403 --> 44:34.404
If he even gets
near her again...

44:34.406 --> 44:37.874
I was tempted
to revoke his bail.

44:37.876 --> 44:39.709
That's a stretch.

44:39.711 --> 44:42.412
He practically asked her
to commit perjury.

44:42.414 --> 44:44.013
Forget stretch.

44:44.015 --> 44:47.250
That's... that's a leap
across the Grand Canyon.

44:47.252 --> 44:49.752
I haven't changed my mind, Doug.

44:49.754 --> 44:52.388
Manslaughter one.

44:54.993 --> 44:58.327
He still insists
he didn't kill the boy.

44:58.329 --> 45:00.463
Fine.

45:00.465 --> 45:03.833
Does he want
to let a jury decide?

45:16.481 --> 45:18.915
Mr. Greer?

45:18.917 --> 45:21.250
Your Honor,
with the court's permission,

45:21.252 --> 45:24.787
the defendant wishes to withdraw
his previously entered plea

45:24.789 --> 45:28.324
and plead guilty to the
charge of manslaughter
in the first degree.

45:28.326 --> 45:30.860
Mr. Stone?

45:30.862 --> 45:32.261
The People agree, Your Honor,

45:32.263 --> 45:35.398
with a sentence
of eight and 1/3 to 25 years

45:35.400 --> 45:37.366
as a condition of the plea.

45:37.368 --> 45:39.869
are pleading guilty
Mr. Messimer, you

45:39.871 --> 45:44.040
to manslaughter
in the death of Thomas Keegan.

45:44.042 --> 45:45.508
Did you, in fact

45:45.510 --> 45:48.411
commit the crime
with which you're charged?

45:48.413 --> 45:51.380
Yes.

45:53.752 --> 45:55.017
For the record,

45:55.019 --> 45:58.888
tell the court
how you committed the crime.

45:58.890 --> 46:01.824
I... I hit him.

46:03.828 --> 46:07.797
There was a lug wrench
next to the boiler.

46:07.799 --> 46:10.299
I hit him on the head.

46:12.270 --> 46:14.971
I saw that he was dead

46:14.973 --> 46:16.439
and I...

46:18.076 --> 46:22.311
I put him inside the wall.

46:26.351 --> 46:29.051
I'm sorry.

46:31.089 --> 46:33.990
The plea agreement
is so entered.

46:51.910 --> 46:54.076
He would have
been convicted.

46:54.078 --> 46:55.344
He'd have done 25.

46:55.346 --> 46:58.080
He's 65 years old,
and I didn't want

46:58.082 --> 47:03.085
his daughter waking up
with nightmares for
the rest of her life.

47:03.087 --> 47:06.122
Now she knows for sure.
She didn't imagine it.
