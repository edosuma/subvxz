happening. I can feel it.

02:24.436 --> 02:26.813
- I knew this was a dumb idea.
- Pop a zannie, J.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.774
We can't see him 'cause
he's being stealth.

02:28.857 --> 02:31.401
No doubt. He's got this. When
has Cesar ever disappointed?

02:31.485 --> 02:33.695
Mmm, fourth grade. Kickball tourney.

02:33.779 --> 02:34.905
We lost.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.074
Only 'cause I picked
the kid with no skills.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.492
And I'd pick you again.

02:40.369 --> 02:42.579
Loyalty trumps victory, compa.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.039
Ah.

02:46.249 --> 02:47.249
Take it in.

02:47.709 --> 02:51.254
This is about to be
us. This is high school.

02:54.299 --> 02:55.299
Aw.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.780
Ruby, you think your
brother's gonna marry Angelica?

02:58.804 --> 03:01.348
No idea. Mario tells me jack.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.911
What about that time he
said Angelica has a dangler?

03:05.519 --> 03:07.270
- But he said that.
- In private!

03:07.771 --> 03:08.814
Time and place, dude.

03:09.981 --> 03:12.150
Oh, guys, check out
Huerita at nine o'clock.

03:12.818 --> 03:15.195
- Monse, if you were a girl...
- I am a girl.

03:15.278 --> 03:18.115
Yeah, but if you were a girl like
that, would you wear underwear?

03:18.657 --> 03:22.536
Oh, my God, I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.037
Why are you gonna die?

03:24.121 --> 03:25.872
Those guys play for the 'Ridge.

03:25.956 --> 03:28.750
Did you know that last year
alone over a quorum of kids...

03:28.834 --> 03:30.335
Died playing football?

03:30.419 --> 03:32.629
You're stuck on repeat. So, don't play.

03:32.712 --> 03:35.215
No choice. My pops was a legend.

03:35.298 --> 03:36.633
It's family tradition.

03:37.801 --> 03:39.052
I'm dead.

03:41.179 --> 03:42.179
You're not dead.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.224
Football spiral?

03:49.229 --> 03:51.648
Jamal, CTE is not in your future.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.942
Guys, check out my game.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.862
Huerita just gave me the nod. Ah!

03:56.945 --> 03:58.155
Eyeing my girl, cabrón?

03:58.238 --> 04:00.449
No. God, no. I'm not into blondes.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.659
Easy. He does your mom's taxes.

04:02.743 --> 04:03.743
Mrs. Guzman, right?

04:04.953 --> 04:06.413
Three thousand dollar refund.

04:06.496 --> 04:09.416
Schedule C, line 30,
home office deduction.

04:09.499 --> 04:10.792
Seriously, dude?

04:12.753 --> 04:14.004
Yo, what are you doing, ese?

04:14.087 --> 04:15.589
That's Spooky's little bro, dawg.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.259
I didn't realize it was you, homie.

04:19.341 --> 04:21.553
Hey, listen, tell Spooky
Sad Eyes sends respects.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.055
Let's get out of here.

04:25.015 --> 04:26.475
Thank God for your brother.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.267
Don't.

04:28.894 --> 04:30.353
Thank God for better things.

04:32.647 --> 04:33.857
- Oh, shoot!
- Let's go!

04:33.940 --> 04:36.060
Get down! Stand behind the door!

04:39.070 --> 04:40.363
That was a .38.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.365
No, it was a .45.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.242
It sounded like a .44.

04:44.743 --> 04:45.786
Wrong!

04:45.869 --> 04:48.121
.357!

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:56.671 --> 04:57.964
Angelica's pissed.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.216
She's always pissed.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.426
You would be too if you had a dangler.

05:02.385 --> 05:03.385
What?

05:04.054 --> 05:06.765
- She's making Mario cry.
- My brother doesn't cry.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.392
Dude, he's crying.

05:10.560 --> 05:11.560
Look at me.

05:14.231 --> 05:16.149
What are you thinking in your head?

05:16.274 --> 05:19.069
Nada. My brain is empty.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.739
Do I really need some
stupid writing camp?

05:22.823 --> 05:25.784
- I don't want to waste my summer.
- It's not a waste, it's badass.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.370
Not everyone can get in,
even the kids who pay.

05:28.453 --> 05:29.453
But...

05:30.914 --> 05:31.914
you'll need this.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.209
It's for writing your stories

05:34.292 --> 05:36.711
and maybe an old-school letter
or two, for your favorite?

05:38.255 --> 05:39.455
Here comes waterworks.

05:47.055 --> 05:48.557
Were you guys spying on me?

05:54.813 --> 05:56.356
- You okay, homie?
- Yes.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.441
No.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.609
I don't know.

06:04.239 --> 06:05.323
Look at you.

06:05.407 --> 06:08.285
On the verge of high
school. All the excitement.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.368
All the firsts.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.205
First parties, first football games,

06:12.664 --> 06:13.790
first love.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.960
- Want me to drop some knowledge?
- Not really.

06:17.043 --> 06:20.463
High school, it's the foundation
for the rest of your life.

06:20.547 --> 06:23.008
Any false starts could
lead to your own dead end.

06:23.091 --> 06:25.760
Now sure, you guys are smart,
setting curves and all that,

06:25.844 --> 06:27.262
but you still have to go hard,

06:27.345 --> 06:29.556
'cause there's only one
chance at a first impression.

06:29.639 --> 06:32.851
So, do you want to sit on the
sidelines or play in the game?

06:32.934 --> 06:34.227
I just don't want to die.

06:34.311 --> 06:36.104
- Is Mario high?
- Yes, he's high...

06:36.730 --> 06:38.481
on life and memories...

06:39.065 --> 06:40.775
and some seriously good indo.

06:41.318 --> 06:45.614
What I was saying is work hard,

06:45.697 --> 06:48.700
put your heart out there, even
if it's broken by some bitch

06:48.783 --> 06:51.911
you've known since Mr. Estrada's
seventh grade social studies.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.706
Anyway...

06:54.789 --> 06:56.249
uh...

06:56.333 --> 06:58.693
... what I was saying, and you
may want to write this down...

07:00.003 --> 07:03.381
Don't go into high
school without back-up.

07:03.798 --> 07:07.761
You guys need to stick
together to survive.

07:08.303 --> 07:09.429
Got it?

07:12.641 --> 07:14.559
I'm going to college, mofos!

07:15.268 --> 07:16.478
Now, kiss my class ring.

07:22.567 --> 07:25.195
- What the freak?
- Is he kidding me?

07:25.654 --> 07:27.882
- That's why you don't smoke that stuff.
- Damn, I almost forgot.

07:27.906 --> 07:30.700
One last thing: don't bone Monse.

07:35.038 --> 07:36.915
Why would anyone want to do that?

07:45.423 --> 07:46.883
Pretty Girl!

07:47.842 --> 07:49.219
Tasty.

07:54.933 --> 07:56.977
Ay, ay, ay! Mamacita!

07:58.895 --> 08:00.271
Angelica!

08:01.481 --> 08:03.024
Once I'm gone, I'm gone!

08:03.650 --> 08:05.652
There's not gonna be a
Christmas break hookup!

08:06.569 --> 08:09.489
You know why? 'Cause I'm gonna
be hooking up with other chicks!

08:09.572 --> 08:11.241
White chicks!

08:15.745 --> 08:18.289
I don't know why I'm
saying that! It's you!

08:19.207 --> 08:20.207
Talk to me, boo!

08:20.250 --> 08:21.710
Maybe she's not home.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.380
Oh.

08:25.463 --> 08:26.589
Hey, you!

08:32.595 --> 08:34.222
How was, uh... camp?

08:34.304 --> 08:36.808
Mmm, tolerable. Mildly life changing.

08:38.183 --> 08:39.602
I can see that.

08:39.686 --> 08:40.937
You can? How?

08:41.020 --> 08:42.147
You just...

08:42.938 --> 08:45.567
Look, I probably have to
go before traffic hits.

08:46.317 --> 08:48.695
- No prob. Good luck at Cal.
- Thanks.

08:49.112 --> 08:51.531
And you, keep an eye on Ruby?

08:52.574 --> 08:54.784
Don't know what that
kid's gonna do without me.

08:56.119 --> 08:57.537
Check me out, bitches!

08:57.620 --> 09:00.540
I got my own room! My own room.

09:01.416 --> 09:02.542
So, let's not trash it.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.863
I don't wanna break my pimp
couch before it gets some play.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.631
High school is an opp for reinvention.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.468
So if I want to live a new
life, I got to be a new man.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.927
It all starts with my kingdom.

09:13.762 --> 09:16.056
- Royal reading?
- Ha.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.058
No. It's a conversation piece.

09:19.309 --> 09:20.852
And 2.99 at Ross.

09:20.935 --> 09:24.689
Enough chitchat, let's feng shui.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.649
- I'm back!
- Can you move that side table?

09:26.733 --> 09:28.485
No, seriously don't make such a fuss.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.968
I've only been gone all summer,
but really, it's no big deal.

09:31.196 --> 09:32.655
- How was camp?
- Camp was fine.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.199
Notice anything new?

09:34.282 --> 09:35.366
You got boobs.

09:36.534 --> 09:40.038
- You can wait for Cesar to help.
- Then we'll be waiting a really long time.

09:40.121 --> 09:41.289
Why? Where's Cesar?

09:41.372 --> 09:42.665
We're not talking to him.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.478
- You in a fight?
- It wasn't really a fight. More like...

09:45.502 --> 09:46.961
We're not getting into it.

09:47.045 --> 09:49.089
Trust us, Cesar's not cool.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.509
Well, I'm not cool being not cool.
And why aren't you at football?

09:52.592 --> 09:55.553
We should really get to orientation
before those lines get too long.

09:55.637 --> 09:57.680
Yeah, I don't want to
be too sweaty for my ID.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.391
Like Mario said, "It's all about
the right first impression."

10:00.475 --> 10:01.601
And sticking together!

10:01.684 --> 10:03.812
You're deflecting
this whole Cesar sitch.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.480
Stop being bitches and tell me.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.482
What happened with Cesar?

10:08.358 --> 10:11.444
This silent treatment will only
last so long. I will break you.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.608
Come on. There's no way
Cesar did anything on purpose

10:13.609 --> 10:14.614
to destroy our crew.

10:14.697 --> 10:17.134
- He's the glue of our crew.
- That was then, and this is now.

10:17.158 --> 10:18.535
Yeah, Cesar ain't shit.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.247
Shit, Prophets.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.130
- Be cool.
- Ditch your colors.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.922
Damn it. Did I just jack my do?

10:32.423 --> 10:33.466
Yeah.

10:35.385 --> 10:36.678
Code dread. Code dread.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.054
Approaching on your six.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.858
Yo! You guys going to orientation?

10:39.931 --> 10:43.351
Hey, you know my cousin
Berto, the fine one, hey?

10:43.434 --> 10:44.954
His daughter Letty
said it ain't nothing,

10:44.978 --> 10:46.455
unless you're stupid and
can't spell your name.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.815
And then you hold up the
line and then people get mad.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.460
Hey, why are you guys walking so fast?

10:50.461 --> 10:52.193
You know I can't keep up. I have asthma.

10:52.610 --> 10:55.905
Sorry, Jasmine, we're having a
private convo. Real sensitive stuff.

10:55.989 --> 10:56.989
Catch you next time.

11:00.201 --> 11:01.870
That's what you always say.

11:20.930 --> 11:23.266
Man, she is relentless.

11:23.641 --> 11:25.268
- Nice save.
- Oh, you're not safe.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.510
Your threats aren't penetrating, okay?

11:27.511 --> 11:28.646
I'm not telling you what Cesar said.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.440
Ah ha! So, he said something!

11:30.523 --> 11:32.609
Jamal! Do you need a muzzle?

11:33.484 --> 11:36.863
Monse, no offense, but
you're a loose cannon.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.746
We're not telling you
for your own protection.

11:38.990 --> 11:42.368
- My own protection? Eat a dick.
- Case in point.

11:42.452 --> 11:45.413
You don't even know, and you're
already at Defcon Solange.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.168
Don't look. Keep walking.

11:57.467 --> 12:00.011
Why would anyone want to
get jumped into 19th Street?

12:00.094 --> 12:02.889
If it were me, I'd join First
Street, only one second of pain.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.808
Agreed. And who wants a lifetime
of commitment at our age?

12:05.892 --> 12:06.952
Apparently, neither of you.

12:06.976 --> 12:10.063
Lack of commitment seems to be a
noticeable trend in this friendship.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.856
As does lack of personal space!

12:18.821 --> 12:22.700
- We can't tell you what Cesar said.
- Fine. Then I'll ask myself.

12:24.452 --> 12:25.578
Hey, you crazy?

12:30.083 --> 12:33.252
I just wanted to let Cesar
know I was back in town.

12:33.336 --> 12:35.838
- And looking like a fine ass hyna.
- An Underaged hyna.

12:35.922 --> 12:36.922
Not for some.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.511
It's all good. You just look
a little different. What is it?

12:41.970 --> 12:42.971
My boobs.

12:43.972 --> 12:46.307
Nah, you got your braces off.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.235
When did Oscar get out?

12:57.318 --> 12:58.569
Six weeks ago.

12:58.653 --> 12:59.821
Now it makes sense.

12:59.904 --> 13:02.240
Whatever Cesar said, he
said to impress Oscar.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.993
- Cesar's terrified of his brother.
- Along with everyone else.

13:05.076 --> 13:07.829
- Then who cares what he said.
- Oh, just drop it.

13:07.912 --> 13:11.207
- Do I look like I can just drop it?
- Actually, you do. You just won't.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.333
Tax time, bitches!

13:12.417 --> 13:13.751
Shit, Latrelle.

13:13.835 --> 13:15.795
Hands up, money out.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.015
How can we take money
out with our hands up?

13:18.047 --> 13:20.383
I know you bookheads got
that back-to-school gwop.

13:20.466 --> 13:21.718
It's orientation day.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.374
So technically, we're
neither back to school

13:23.375 --> 13:24.641
nor out of school. We're...

13:24.679 --> 13:26.347
We don't have any money.

13:27.390 --> 13:28.390
What about that 20?

13:38.317 --> 13:40.278
At least you finally got your own room.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.533
What do you mean I
don't have my own room?

13:45.616 --> 13:47.243
It's only been four hours.

13:47.326 --> 13:49.096
Abuelita's room is flooded
from the broken washer.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.706
She's gonna have to sleep in
your room till we can dry it out.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.166
Did you try renting a WetVac?

13:53.249 --> 13:55.126
Papa thinks that there might be mold.

13:55.209 --> 13:57.754
- So?
- So she can't sleep in there.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.131
Ma, she grew up in an adobe hut.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.382
She'll be fine.

14:01.466 --> 14:05.178
Ruby, you've never had your own
room. Why do you need one now?

14:06.387 --> 14:09.849
For stuff. Like... Like my brain.

14:09.932 --> 14:12.685
I mean, there's scientific evidence
that the brain grows every day,

14:12.769 --> 14:14.437
and my brain needs room.

14:14.520 --> 14:15.897
A room to grow.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.982
- Do you really wanna challenge science?
- Mmm.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.817
Why can't she stay in the living room?

14:19.901 --> 14:22.195
Grandma hasn't been back
to Mexico in a while.

14:22.278 --> 14:24.447
Come on, Ma! I'm a man!

14:27.992 --> 14:29.452
I can't share with Abuelita.

14:29.952 --> 14:33.164
- What if I give you another option?
- Yes, please, anything. Bring it.

14:34.123 --> 14:35.333
You can bunk with the twins!

14:42.507 --> 14:43.508
Are you high?

14:45.176 --> 14:46.719
I'm not gonna hash shit out.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.429
To what end? Death?

14:48.513 --> 14:49.972
Cesar might've joined the gang.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.057
He's not stupid.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.601
He's affiliated, yes,
because of his brother, but...

14:53.684 --> 14:57.146
And his cousins, his
uncles, his dad, his grandpa.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.232
- Even the gay one.
- I know. I know.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.317
Wait. You knew about the gay one?

15:02.026 --> 15:03.921
He goes by the name Bananas.
It's not that subtle.

15:03.945 --> 15:06.572
No! I know Cesar's family's
been in that life forever.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.241
But he'd never join a gang.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.450
He's an outlier.

15:09.534 --> 15:11.202
So whatever's going on, it's not that.

15:11.285 --> 15:12.578
He's not the same.

15:13.079 --> 15:16.457
- He dumped us.
- But I wasn't here, so it's not official.

15:16.541 --> 15:19.168
If someone breaks up with
you over text, is it official?

15:19.252 --> 15:20.837
- Yes.
- Then consider me the text.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.672
Ding!

15:22.755 --> 15:25.591
You've been dumped!
Wait, please don't go.

15:25.675 --> 15:26.675
Please, you're...

15:27.260 --> 15:28.636
- You're not safe.
- Why?

15:29.804 --> 15:32.682
Because you've... blossomed.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.100
- "Blossomed?"
- Popped.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.436
Busted out. Puffed your party pillows.

15:36.519 --> 15:38.080
Whatever you want to call
your new cha-cha-bingos.

15:38.104 --> 15:40.857
These new homies he's
hanging with, they're thirsty.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.361
Okay!

15:46.070 --> 15:47.196
Don't worry, girl!

15:47.697 --> 15:48.990
I got your back...

15:50.908 --> 15:51.951
from right here.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.749
- I need to talk to you.
- I'm listening.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.295
Privately?

16:03.921 --> 16:05.882
Yeah, we can go inside.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.178
But if you wanna sit on my face,

16:10.261 --> 16:12.805
you got to put that mouth on
pause so I can concentrate.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.645
- Cesar is dead to me!
- Told ya.

16:19.729 --> 16:22.023
He doesn't break up with us,
we're breaking up with him!

16:22.106 --> 16:24.317
"Sit on my face"? Who says that?

16:24.400 --> 16:27.612
Chairs who can talk! And buttholes!

16:27.695 --> 16:30.323
I wouldn't put dumb crap like
that past Oscar, but Cesar?

16:31.908 --> 16:32.909
What happened to him?

16:33.868 --> 16:35.453
Cesar's gotta be hitting the pipe.

16:35.536 --> 16:37.330
Right? Right.

16:37.747 --> 16:38.748
Could be!

16:39.123 --> 16:41.167
That was totally out of character.

16:43.628 --> 16:44.754
What are you doing?

16:46.255 --> 16:47.798
I'm getting into character.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.011
Hey, Pops!

16:53.888 --> 16:55.973
Say nothing and go with my flow.

16:56.057 --> 16:57.099
Monse!

16:58.851 --> 17:00.186
Welcome back, baby.

17:00.269 --> 17:02.749
- You ready for the new year?
- Bound to be a lot of surprises.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.193
- How was practice?
- Yeah, how was practice?

17:08.361 --> 17:11.280
I don't know. Ask those D1
scouts who were all up on me.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.991
That's my boy.

17:14.407 --> 17:15.407
Ow.

17:15.451 --> 17:16.911
Whoa.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.223
Did you quit the team
and not tell your dad?

17:20.248 --> 17:21.332
No.

17:21.415 --> 17:24.710
Yes. Look, I suited up first
day, and I just wasn't feeling it.

17:24.794 --> 17:25.836
Wasn't feeling it?

17:25.920 --> 17:29.048
Yeah, I wasn't feeling
like breaking my neck.

17:29.715 --> 17:33.135
Listen, everybody who knows me
knows I suck, except my pops.

17:33.469 --> 17:34.815
And he keeps thinking
that I'm just gonna

17:34.816 --> 17:36.973
wake up one day and be him, and...

17:37.557 --> 17:38.683
I'm not him.

17:39.642 --> 17:41.644
I just need to find the
right time to tell him.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.980
How ironic that a guy
who can't keep a secret

17:44.063 --> 17:45.541
is keeping the biggest
secret of his life.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.903
- What?
- I'm gonna rat you out to your dad...

17:51.487 --> 17:54.198
unless you drop the 411
about Cesar. What did he say?

17:54.282 --> 17:56.075
- No.
- Yes! Mr. Turn...

17:56.158 --> 17:58.828
Cesar said you let him hit
it before you left for camp.

18:10.006 --> 18:12.562
So, what exactly was the context

18:12.563 --> 18:14.135
when Cesar said he "hit it" with Monse?

18:14.218 --> 18:17.471
He didn't say he "hit it." He
said he "smashed, really hard."

18:17.555 --> 18:19.115
- But who cares about context?
- I care!

18:19.599 --> 18:22.518
Dude, you can't keep one secret.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.270
She was blackmailing me.

18:25.229 --> 18:27.291
- I can't do this right now.
- Why are you whispering?

18:27.315 --> 18:29.150
- Where are you?
- Hell.

18:31.736 --> 18:35.323
Look, I'm dealing with some
jacked up, cracked up B.S. at home,

18:35.406 --> 18:37.533
and I got to work it
out before school starts.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.952
So, this Cesar sitch, it
just ain't top priority.

18:40.036 --> 18:41.996
- Can we just meet up tomorrow?
-  Can't.

18:42.079 --> 18:44.582
Got one last shift at my dad's
joint before summer's over.

18:44.665 --> 18:47.835
Dude, there's no way I'm facing
the Inquisition all by myself.

18:47.918 --> 18:50.421
Geez. Can't we just meet at the
joint at 5:00 and chop it up?

18:50.504 --> 18:51.547
Fine.

18:56.886 --> 18:59.847
God, you owe me a handy.

19:03.392 --> 19:06.145
That's my 11th text. Ruby's
almost two hours late.

19:06.228 --> 19:09.523
Chill. He said he'll be here,
so he'll be here. Trust me.

19:09.607 --> 19:11.609
Said the guy who's
pretending to play football?

19:12.318 --> 19:13.778
Maybe my pops won't notice.

19:14.528 --> 19:17.615
Uh, somehow I don't
think that's possible.

19:20.660 --> 19:21.827
Where the hell is Ruby?

19:22.203 --> 19:24.580
Five more minutes, kid.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.540
Abuelita, I have to go!

19:26.624 --> 19:28.834
Five more minutes, kid.

19:28.918 --> 19:31.420
That's what you've been
saying the last half an hour.

19:31.504 --> 19:35.216
- Can I at least have my phone?
- Five more minutes, kid.

19:35.675 --> 19:36.675
What's going on?

19:37.134 --> 19:38.511
I think it's pretty obvious.

19:38.594 --> 19:41.138
Great. So, walk me through the
moment Cesar said what he said.

19:41.222 --> 19:43.224
- Don't worry about it.
- There you go again.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.347
- There you go again what?
- Keeping things from me.

19:45.393 --> 19:47.144
You gotta stop withholding, God damn it!

19:49.355 --> 19:50.648
I'm sorry, ma'am.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.317
It's okay. I watch Bravo.

19:54.485 --> 19:56.696
Monse. Wait! Monse!

19:58.823 --> 20:00.116
We need to go back inside.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.743
What did Cesar exactly
say? And how did he say it?

20:02.827 --> 20:04.537
I need context. Tone. I need to know.

20:04.620 --> 20:07.498
You know what I know. What I
don't know is why he said it.

20:07.581 --> 20:11.085
But he said it. We tried to get him
to take it back, but he wouldn't.

20:11.168 --> 20:12.962
So what can we do? Drop it.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.255
- I can't.
- Why?

20:14.338 --> 20:16.132
I'm still figuring out if I hate him.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.633
You heard what your brother said.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.361
How are we gonna survive
high school without Cesar?

20:19.385 --> 20:20.761
Mario's not some sage.

20:21.137 --> 20:23.973
Don't take his words to
heart. They're just words.

20:24.056 --> 20:27.059
If that's true then why should
we take Cesar's words to heart?

20:27.143 --> 20:28.144
They're just words.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.731
Sometimes it's not what
you say, but how you say it.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.735
And Cesar said it like he meant
it. But things could be worse.

20:36.527 --> 20:38.279
What's worse than losing a friend?

20:39.113 --> 20:40.948
Entering high school with a rep.

20:41.323 --> 20:44.744
You're smart enough to know that
a rumor could ruin your life.

20:46.287 --> 20:47.747
But it's contained.

20:49.290 --> 20:51.041
You're right. No one knows.

20:53.294 --> 20:54.294
Hi!

20:54.587 --> 20:55.588
Damn, Ruby.

20:56.255 --> 20:59.842
I see you! I see you!
And I'm down with it.

20:59.925 --> 21:02.303
I like the freaky, just like Monse.

21:03.679 --> 21:06.324
- What are you talkin' about?
- You ain't gotta be shy with me, girl.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.017
I know you and Cesar been gettin' it in.

21:09.351 --> 21:11.353
No one knows? Really?

21:12.438 --> 21:15.524
I officially hate the traitor,
and now I'm gonna kick his ass.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.443
Monse! Monse!

21:18.194 --> 21:19.528
Oh, my God!

21:27.661 --> 21:28.662
You little bitch!

21:28.746 --> 21:30.206
Ow.

21:30.706 --> 21:33.334
Damn, that hyna's wild.
Must be a freak on all fours.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.794
I fought for you. I had your back.

21:34.877 --> 21:37.063
For what? For you to impress your
puto friends and humiliate me?

21:37.087 --> 21:38.847
Tell your bitch to keep that bark down.

21:38.923 --> 21:41.133
Hermanito, you better back
up before you get smacked up.

21:41.217 --> 21:42.277
- Shut up, puto.
- Monse!

21:42.301 --> 21:43.719
Hey, watch it now.

21:43.803 --> 21:44.804
No! Monse.

21:48.432 --> 21:51.112
- This is why we didn't wanna tell you!
- 'Cause you're going crazy!

21:51.644 --> 21:53.145
Crazy? I'm crazy?

21:53.229 --> 21:54.897
Calm down. Breathe.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.315
Don't you patronize me!

21:56.732 --> 21:58.317
I don't need you. Any of you.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.878
I was trying to keep our crew together,

21:59.902 --> 22:02.738
but since I'm the only one who
cares, you're all dead to me.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.156
I'll survive on my own.

22:09.286 --> 22:11.121
Jasonse or Monsmine?

22:11.205 --> 22:13.499
Which one you think is the
better bestie power name?

22:14.375 --> 22:16.836
Yo, where we gonna kick it
at lunch and between classes?

22:17.419 --> 22:18.587
We gonna hit up the flags?

22:18.671 --> 22:21.924
No, flags can kiss my juicy
nalga. Nothin' but skinny putas.

22:23.509 --> 22:25.261
We are trying out for dance.

22:25.344 --> 22:28.180
I ain't sups coordinated,
but I give really good face.

22:28.264 --> 22:31.016
I just love that we're doing
this together. You feel me?

22:31.850 --> 22:34.270
Monse? Hello?

22:35.437 --> 22:36.814
Are you listening to me?

22:36.897 --> 22:39.608
All we were trying to
do was be good friends...

22:40.025 --> 22:41.360
and now we're not friends.

22:42.570 --> 22:44.071
Yo, bitches be bonkers.

22:47.283 --> 22:50.119
Breh! Breh! Breh! Breh!

22:50.202 --> 22:51.579
We need like our own routine.

22:51.662 --> 22:53.367
Like a sick one that only we know,

22:53.368 --> 22:56.375
and we bust out at, like, at lunch...

22:57.167 --> 22:59.920
or before school or at all
the parties we're gonna go to.

23:00.004 --> 23:01.380
Yo, check it, can you do this?

23:02.089 --> 23:03.089
Can you do that?

23:03.591 --> 23:05.843
Don't worry, girl, I'm gonna teach you.

23:06.677 --> 23:09.054
I'm gonna teach you.
I'm gonna teach you.

23:10.014 --> 23:12.474
Soon, Monse, you gonna look like this.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.435
This is gonna be you.

23:15.269 --> 23:17.646
Hoo! You gonna learn today.

23:17.730 --> 23:20.065
Watch that, watch it.

23:20.149 --> 23:23.068
No, we're looking hard. This
is how you pull in the honeys.

23:23.152 --> 23:26.947
No, we pull in the honeys by
finding the RollerWorld money.

23:27.281 --> 23:28.741
This is lame. This ain't even real.

23:28.824 --> 23:31.118
You know what's not
real? Is RollerWorld.

23:31.201 --> 23:33.037
There's no money buried
in our neighborhood.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.667
It is real. You just aren't a believer.

23:35.668 --> 23:37.374
You don't even believe in the Yeti.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.835
Oh, my God.

23:43.672 --> 23:44.798
Hey.

23:45.215 --> 23:46.258
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:46.342 --> 23:49.178
So... I'm cool if you're cool.

23:51.388 --> 23:52.890
- I'm cool.
- I'm cool.

23:53.641 --> 23:56.060
Cool. What's in the sacks?

23:56.393 --> 23:57.603
- Forties.
- Gatorade.

24:00.814 --> 24:01.814
I'll see you tomorrow?

24:08.864 --> 24:10.991
Dad, I can't keep a secret for crap.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.600
I'm not playing freshman football.
I don't even like football.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.917
What do you mean not playing
and you don't like football?

24:21.001 --> 24:22.002
I...

24:23.671 --> 24:25.839
I don't like football...

24:28.175 --> 24:29.551
because I love football!

24:31.470 --> 24:33.055
And I'm playing varsity.

24:34.139 --> 24:35.139
You serious?

24:35.808 --> 24:37.393

Stop worrying.

25:17.057 --> 25:18.217
It's my job to worry.

25:18.267 --> 25:19.490
Especially since it's the first time

25:19.491 --> 25:20.662
I'm leaving you alone without a sitter.

25:20.686 --> 25:24.523
Dad, I'm good. And not hiring Mrs.
Ruiz will save us a lot of money.

25:24.606 --> 25:26.525
- Don't you worry about that.
- I have to.

25:26.608 --> 25:28.878
Saving money means you don't
have to go on long hauls as much,

25:28.902 --> 25:30.156
which means you don't
have to leave as much,

25:30.157 --> 25:31.864
which means no more Mrs. Ruiz.

25:33.157 --> 25:35.427
Remind me not to challenge you
in the future. You always win.

25:35.451 --> 25:37.327
I'm inside now. Door is locked.

25:37.411 --> 25:39.556
You saw it's double bolted.
You saw it's double chained.

25:39.580 --> 25:42.332
So, get some rest and I'll
call you when I wake up, okay?

25:42.416 --> 25:44.668
Okay. Love you, baby.

25:44.752 --> 25:45.919
Love you, too.

25:58.223 --> 25:59.600
What are you doing here?

25:59.683 --> 26:01.226
- Get out!
- Hear me out, please.

26:02.311 --> 26:03.937
I never meant to hurt you.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.440
Then why did you say it?

26:09.693 --> 26:11.653
We promised we weren't
gonna tell anybody.

26:13.530 --> 26:14.530
Hey.

26:15.824 --> 26:18.535
You were the one who said
that we should keep this thing,

26:18.619 --> 26:19.787
our thing, on the low.

26:19.870 --> 26:21.662
That it would create a rift
in the crew, and it did.

26:21.663 --> 26:22.873
So why'd you do it?

26:24.666 --> 26:25.834
Oscar.

26:26.668 --> 26:27.753
I don't understand.

26:27.836 --> 26:30.881
When he got out, he wanted to
get at you, so I claimed you.

26:31.381 --> 26:32.381
To protect you.

26:37.179 --> 26:39.097
You don't have to protect me.

26:39.181 --> 26:41.225
Protect yourself. Leave.

26:41.308 --> 26:43.727
- Get away from Oscar.
- You don't understand.

26:43.811 --> 26:46.480
You're gonna go off and
be a famous writer someday.

26:46.855 --> 26:49.209
Ruby's gonna follow his brother
and go to some fancy college.

26:49.233 --> 26:51.693
Jamal, he'll figure
things out and get out.

26:52.736 --> 26:53.737
But this life...

26:54.822 --> 26:58.408
it's my destiny. My family crest
is and will always be a gang sign.

26:58.492 --> 27:00.244
- It's too late.
- No, it's not.

27:00.911 --> 27:03.038
- There are so many...
- You guys got me all twisted

27:03.121 --> 27:05.791
all these years about a
future away from this place,

27:05.874 --> 27:06.959
but it ain't gonna happen.

27:09.419 --> 27:11.046
Man, this is all I got.

27:12.256 --> 27:14.508
No, it's not.

27:48.959 --> 27:50.168
You got jumped in.

28:21.199 --> 28:24.453
- He's not coming with us.
- And why would you want him to?

28:25.203 --> 28:26.203
Monse?

28:27.122 --> 28:28.248
Monse!

28:30.042 --> 28:32.586
See, bitches be bonkers.

29:03.033 --> 29:06.203
I can't do this. I can't keep a secret.

29:06.286 --> 29:09.331
It's gonna make me implode.
I don't know why anybody keeps secrets.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.584
There's something I need to tell you.

29:14.836 --> 29:15.837
.44!

29:18.006 --> 29:19.007
Cesar.

29:44.491 --> 29:45.867
What were you gonna say?

29:46.410 --> 29:47.410
Cesar...

29:49.079 --> 29:50.330
we need to save him.
