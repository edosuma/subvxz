00:00.373 --> 00:02.674
<i>Previously on "The Americans"...</i>

00:02.777 --> 00:05.244
Is something going on?

00:05.691 --> 00:07.663
I've been wanting to tell you.

00:07.782 --> 00:09.515
The business is falling apart.

00:09.829 --> 00:12.357
And I think it might be going under.

00:12.453 --> 00:15.387
I used to ask myself,
why is this guy, and his wife,

00:15.489 --> 00:17.356
coming home at three, four
in the morning?

00:17.411 --> 00:19.544
How hard can they possibly work?

00:19.603 --> 00:21.103

00:21.151 --> 00:23.931

00:24.168 --> 00:26.481
_

00:26.747 --> 00:28.320
_

00:30.459 --> 00:32.159
I have to tell you something.

00:32.259 --> 00:35.861
Someone from home reached out to me.

00:36.308 --> 00:39.812
He asked me to tell him
what you were doing.

00:39.914 --> 00:41.413
What did you tell him?

00:41.644 --> 00:43.950
That you were looking into
one of our negotiators

00:43.984 --> 00:45.503
who you thought was a traitor.

00:45.553 --> 00:48.325
Nesterenko didn't say
anything suspicious at the meeting.

00:48.452 --> 00:49.568
It doesn't matter.

00:49.658 --> 00:51.162
You need to take care of him.

00:51.322 --> 00:53.091
And... they tell us
what to do and we do it,

00:53.441 --> 00:54.993
I get it, that's how it works,

00:55.167 --> 00:57.996
but... we do it, not them.

00:58.284 --> 00:59.417
I didn't do it.

00:59.460 --> 01:00.676
Nesterenko.

01:00.701 --> 01:02.301
He seems like a decent man.

01:02.403 --> 01:05.337
After all these years,
serving your country,

01:05.438 --> 01:07.639
don't throw it all away, now.

01:07.899 --> 01:09.441
I need to talk to your guy.

01:09.852 --> 01:13.512
Tell him that what
he's worried about is happening.

01:13.915 --> 01:15.414
This came in while you were out.

01:15.616 --> 01:16.882
Father Andrei.

01:16.957 --> 01:19.418
You meet him.
Maybe he'll give you absolution.

01:19.667 --> 01:20.933
I have to go back out.

01:21.026 --> 01:23.626
They might still go after Nesterenko.

05:18.498 --> 05:19.664
Hey!

05:19.752 --> 05:21.485
- Hey.
- What's up?

05:21.614 --> 05:23.817
I was in the area,
thought I'd stick my head in.

05:23.842 --> 05:25.324
Ah. You want some coffee or something?

05:25.351 --> 05:26.404
No, I'm good.

05:26.484 --> 05:27.750
Place looks different.

05:28.172 --> 05:29.752
You haven't been here
since the expansion.

05:29.827 --> 05:30.827
Let me show you around.

05:30.852 --> 05:32.085
We... Yeah.

05:32.702 --> 05:34.834
We tore down walls,
we opened things up,

05:34.859 --> 05:37.597
and made some room
for all the employees we added.

05:37.709 --> 05:38.864
- Wow.
- Philip?

05:38.916 --> 05:40.559
- Yeah?
- Oh. Is this a bad time?

05:40.598 --> 05:43.221
No, no, no, no. Rick,
come meet my buddy Stan Beeman.

05:43.254 --> 05:46.255
Stan is an FBI agent,
so be careful what you say.

05:46.315 --> 05:48.184
- Oh.
- Yeah, we did a trip

05:48.209 --> 05:50.002
for his friends a bunch of years back.

05:50.027 --> 05:52.973
You know, with
all this new expansion...

05:52.998 --> 05:56.563
And all our new resources...
We should just dig in

05:56.588 --> 05:59.464
and see if we can help out
with the Bureau's travel needs.

05:59.671 --> 06:02.026
Sure... I could see
who handles that stuff.

06:03.275 --> 06:05.175
Yeah, I mean...

06:05.304 --> 06:06.670
Only if...

06:06.778 --> 06:08.278
Yeah, um...

06:08.406 --> 06:11.540
- I just need you to, uh, sign this.
- Yeah. Yeah.

06:15.784 --> 06:16.893
Nice to meet you.

06:16.968 --> 06:18.434
Likewise.

06:18.523 --> 06:22.094
I'm sorry. I always have
my salesman's hat on in here.

06:22.194 --> 06:23.927
No, it's okay,
you know, I can ask around.

06:24.036 --> 06:25.308
No, no. Don't. Don't.

06:25.350 --> 06:28.571
You know, I'm not desperate,
I'm glad you stopped by.

06:33.325 --> 06:36.159
Haven't gotten around
to, uh, re-doing the office.

06:36.201 --> 06:38.334
Good thing I didn't.

06:38.383 --> 06:40.750
She out of town again?

06:40.946 --> 06:42.545
Uh...

06:42.733 --> 06:45.450
No, we... we had a fight.

06:46.057 --> 06:47.783
'Bout what?

06:48.013 --> 06:49.112
Work.

06:50.221 --> 06:52.590
Renee says you guys are lucky
to get to work together.

06:54.059 --> 06:56.185
She wants to come work
at the FBI with me.

06:57.722 --> 06:59.522
How about that?

06:59.644 --> 07:01.525
Yeah. I don't know. Be careful.

07:04.368 --> 07:07.269
So, how much in the hole are you?

07:09.641 --> 07:12.456
I... I don't want to say.

07:12.751 --> 07:14.818
You know, I could...

07:14.973 --> 07:16.706
I could maybe come up with something.

07:16.801 --> 07:18.624
I have some savings. As a loan.

07:18.683 --> 07:21.941
Thanks, but, you know, I'm
working on turning things around

07:21.966 --> 07:24.032
and getting things back
on an even keel...

07:24.057 --> 07:26.290
Um, but I appreciate that, truly...

07:26.351 --> 07:30.387
but, um, I can't take your money.

09:04.322 --> 09:05.722
Â¿Hola?

09:05.850 --> 09:07.483
<i>- Pastor Tim?</i>
- Yep.

09:07.559 --> 09:10.333
<i>It's Stan Beeman. I'm not sure
if you remember me.</i>

09:10.388 --> 09:13.033
I'm a neighbor of
Philip and Elizabeth Jennings.

09:13.144 --> 09:14.677
The FBI agent.

09:14.979 --> 09:18.114
<i>We had dinner at the Jennings'
house a while back.</i>

09:19.511 --> 09:22.211
Of course. Yes, I remember you.

09:23.642 --> 09:25.575
Is everything okay?

09:25.650 --> 09:27.650
Oh, yes. Fine. Fine.
I didn't mean to alarm you.

09:27.679 --> 09:31.013
I just wanted to ask you
a few questions.

09:34.125 --> 09:35.357
Okay.

09:36.481 --> 09:38.701
How do you like Buenos Aires?

09:40.118 --> 09:43.320
Uh, it's a lot of hard work,
but I love it.

09:43.768 --> 09:45.639
Never get homesick?

09:45.764 --> 09:48.731
<i>Well, there's definitely
things I miss, people.</i>

09:48.980 --> 09:51.447
But this feels like home now.

09:54.005 --> 09:56.112
And your wife and daughter are well?

09:57.976 --> 10:00.550
Yes, they are. Thank you for asking.

10:02.314 --> 10:05.849
But you didn't call
to ask me about that.

10:07.211 --> 10:08.410
No.

10:10.048 --> 10:13.011
I know you are,

10:13.184 --> 10:16.018
were close to the Jennings.

10:17.541 --> 10:18.807
Yes.

10:18.832 --> 10:20.799
I haven't spoken to them
in years, though.

10:21.125 --> 10:23.543
<i>Yeah. Hard to keep in touch
when you're so far away.</i>

10:23.648 --> 10:25.381
Yeah.

10:27.405 --> 10:30.376
This conversation
should stay between us.

10:30.508 --> 10:33.675
I'm speaking with you as
a law enforcement officer now.

10:35.006 --> 10:37.240
<i>Plus, I know you're used to
keeping things confidential,</i>

10:37.265 --> 10:39.232
<i>so I would appreciate it if you could</i>

10:39.384 --> 10:41.517
<i>keep our conversation confidential.</i>

10:42.781 --> 10:44.400
Sure. I understand.

10:44.502 --> 10:45.534
<i>Good.</i>

10:48.392 --> 10:53.308
Is there anything I should know,
as an FBI agent,

10:53.665 --> 10:56.232
about the Jennings family?

10:56.995 --> 11:00.563
<i>Anything about them that concerned you?</i>

11:05.818 --> 11:07.319
Well, I'm not sure
what you're looking for,

11:07.344 --> 11:09.731
but I've always
been impressed with them.

11:10.669 --> 11:14.637
<i>Paige is a very dedicated
and thoughtful young woman.</i>

11:15.112 --> 11:17.941
Always so helpful at the church.

11:18.876 --> 11:21.264
Philip and Elizabeth...

11:21.880 --> 11:24.669
weren't members of the church...

11:26.324 --> 11:28.678
<i>but I know they loved Paige.</i>

11:30.861 --> 11:33.329
So... nothing else?

11:36.540 --> 11:38.154
Not really.

13:01.442 --> 13:04.035
_

13:40.404 --> 13:41.971
Is he in?

13:47.337 --> 13:48.603
Yeah?

13:53.254 --> 13:55.621
Sorry, Stan. I'm...

13:55.723 --> 13:56.956
Sabonis's reports

13:56.981 --> 13:59.068
on the video surveillance
for the garages.

13:59.093 --> 14:01.627
He's analyzed fifteen hundred
hours of footage.

14:01.729 --> 14:03.053
Anything?

14:03.163 --> 14:04.863
Nope.

14:05.032 --> 14:06.032
What's up?

14:06.066 --> 14:07.601
Uh...

14:08.769 --> 14:11.609
Any chance you've got
ten minutes for a beer?

14:12.273 --> 14:13.448
Now?

14:13.528 --> 14:16.441
Maybe after work? Today.

14:16.560 --> 14:19.002
I'll be here till the wee hours.

14:19.213 --> 14:22.576
Yeah. I probably will, too.

14:22.983 --> 14:26.018
Okay, well, yeah...

14:27.387 --> 14:29.187
You want to have lunch?

14:29.490 --> 14:30.965
Right now?

14:31.551 --> 14:32.817
That sounds good.

14:35.929 --> 14:37.496
When's Renee's interview?

14:37.598 --> 14:39.364
Next Wednesday.

14:39.466 --> 14:41.967
Pretty soon it'll be the three
of us having lunch here.

14:42.069 --> 14:43.368
Yeah. Great.

14:43.470 --> 14:45.343
You'll get used to it.

14:45.425 --> 14:48.526
Breakfast... dinner...
I think one meal in between...

14:48.795 --> 14:51.657
Well, you'll just tell her you're busy.

14:51.751 --> 14:52.950
Yeah.

15:01.088 --> 15:02.587
You okay?

15:02.742 --> 15:04.398
Yeah.

15:09.430 --> 15:10.896
What's going on?

15:16.170 --> 15:18.458
I know this sounds crazy,

15:20.148 --> 15:23.208
but I can't get this thing
out of my head.

15:23.402 --> 15:24.578
What?

15:28.182 --> 15:30.166
You know Philip and Elizabeth...

15:31.852 --> 15:33.544
When I first met them,

15:33.679 --> 15:36.272
I was working on the Timoshev thing.

15:36.769 --> 15:40.404
Philip and Elizabeth drove
the same make and model of car

15:40.559 --> 15:42.993
that was seen
near where he was kidnapped.

15:43.089 --> 15:44.996
Different license, but...

15:46.066 --> 15:48.840
I know, it's stupid, right?

15:49.489 --> 15:51.521
I forgot about it after that,

15:53.040 --> 15:56.722
but the way she rushed
out of town on Thanksgiving...

15:56.977 --> 15:58.076
Yeah...

15:58.151 --> 16:01.219
And he headed out after, the next day,

16:01.348 --> 16:04.783
right when everything
was going down in Chicago.

16:04.911 --> 16:07.585
They left their kid here alone.

16:08.174 --> 16:11.475
Who does that, over Thanksgiving?

16:21.668 --> 16:25.170
I talked to this guy
who worked with Gregory Thomas,

16:25.272 --> 16:26.964
the guy who killed my partner...

16:27.024 --> 16:28.157
I know.

16:28.182 --> 16:30.115
He said the woman
who Gregory worked with...

16:30.304 --> 16:32.271
Who was also Gregory's girlfriend...

16:32.446 --> 16:35.947
Had beautiful hair
and smoked like a chimney.

16:36.116 --> 16:37.552
The other night,

16:37.617 --> 16:40.285
I found a bunch of cigarette
butts behind their house.

16:41.507 --> 16:43.874
I've never seen Elizabeth smoke.

16:44.550 --> 16:46.154
You went over to their house?

16:46.260 --> 16:48.627
Yeah. I...

16:51.271 --> 16:53.071
I couldn't get it out of my mind,

16:53.604 --> 16:55.660
and I thought,

16:57.023 --> 16:59.057
what if...

17:00.901 --> 17:04.236
You think Elizabeth Jennings
was Gregory Thomas's girlfriend?

17:04.261 --> 17:05.660
I know that it sounds...

17:05.724 --> 17:08.393
Philip and Elizabeth Jennings
are not Russian spies.

17:08.580 --> 17:10.902
I know it sounds crazy, Dennis...

17:18.492 --> 17:21.214
You remember what William Crandall said

17:21.328 --> 17:23.428
before he died?

17:23.664 --> 17:25.363
Regular couple,

17:25.465 --> 17:28.532
pretty wife, couple of kids...

17:28.704 --> 17:30.637
Well, that narrows it
to a million people

17:30.662 --> 17:31.995
in the metropolitan area.

17:32.072 --> 17:34.201
Maybe more, depending
on his taste in women.

17:36.343 --> 17:38.310
Agent Aderholt.

17:38.412 --> 17:40.645
I was just coming to find you.
Agent Wolfe's ready.

17:44.585 --> 17:46.084
I gotta go.

18:17.317 --> 18:19.468
Thank you for coming in
to talk to us, Father.

18:19.546 --> 18:21.580
We're sorry we had to insist.

18:21.627 --> 18:24.050
It's all right.

18:24.805 --> 18:26.737
We have no problem with the church.

18:26.833 --> 18:28.859
We hope you understand that.

18:29.696 --> 18:31.496
I understand.

18:31.899 --> 18:33.726
We do want to ask you a few questions

18:33.773 --> 18:36.174
about certain dealings
we know the church hierarchy

18:36.259 --> 18:38.430
has had with
some official representatives

18:38.478 --> 18:40.478
of the Soviet government.

18:40.620 --> 18:45.957
You understand of course,
I am a man of God.

18:46.026 --> 18:47.559
Yes, of course.

18:49.483 --> 18:52.007
I shouldn't be harassed or subjected

18:52.041 --> 18:54.842
to any kind of intimidation

18:54.980 --> 18:59.106
by those people who fail
to respect my position as,

18:59.353 --> 19:03.455
first and foremost, a servant of God.

19:03.864 --> 19:05.468
We understand, Father.

19:08.261 --> 19:11.863
If I'm here because...

19:15.349 --> 19:18.717
Well, I know people talk.

19:20.347 --> 19:24.776
And I'm aware
things are of concern to you.

19:25.486 --> 19:27.953
But it's of concern to me, too.

19:29.616 --> 19:30.812
Good.

19:32.292 --> 19:35.384
When certain people in the church,

19:35.661 --> 19:39.930
whose connections
to the authorities back home

19:40.233 --> 19:43.530
are more important to them
than serving God,

19:43.937 --> 19:48.206
talk about me, to their own "contacts,"

19:48.408 --> 19:50.269
behind my back,

19:51.123 --> 19:54.680
well, I am justifiably angry.

19:55.214 --> 19:56.867
Absolutely.

19:57.151 --> 20:01.320
They will tell you they've been
forced to cooperate,

20:01.628 --> 20:04.595
that they wouldn't be able
to join the church

20:04.657 --> 20:07.191
or progress in the hierarchy otherwise.

20:08.916 --> 20:13.452
But I haven't made these associations.

20:13.734 --> 20:17.691
I shouldn't pay the price
for their moral weakness.

20:18.292 --> 20:21.393
Who are you talking about
specifically, sir?

20:26.513 --> 20:31.349
Father Andrei, for one.

20:31.769 --> 20:34.319
And also Father...

20:34.664 --> 20:35.760
Not now.

20:35.822 --> 20:37.856
I'm sorry. It can't wait.

20:45.759 --> 20:47.492
The team on Acrobat just radio'd in.

20:47.601 --> 20:49.052
They think he just did something.

20:49.108 --> 20:51.312
Not sure, but it looked like
he pulled himself into the black

20:51.338 --> 20:52.837
for a couple seconds.

20:55.042 --> 20:58.287
Search him there.
Anything on him, bring him in.

21:21.107 --> 21:23.141
Oleg Burov.

22:29.936 --> 22:31.903
What's wrong?

22:32.005 --> 22:33.585
I got the signal.

22:33.719 --> 22:35.753
I picked up the package.

22:35.949 --> 22:39.650
On my way back...
There was an accident.

22:39.913 --> 22:42.034
A policeman was dead.

22:42.187 --> 22:45.155
Another man... hurt very bad.

22:45.404 --> 22:46.770
A horse...

22:48.254 --> 22:50.221
there was no one else around...

22:50.323 --> 22:53.633
I didn't know if I should help him.

22:53.993 --> 22:57.310
We are not supposed to stop,
on an operational run.

22:57.630 --> 23:00.564
If police arrived,
they could've questioned me,

23:00.589 --> 23:01.654
when I still had it...

23:01.700 --> 23:05.094
- In America, yes...
- Even in training, you said...

23:05.119 --> 23:07.351
we have to act like we're there...

23:07.513 --> 23:12.249
You don't leave a comrade
on the street to die in Moscow.

23:35.234 --> 23:38.160
<i>I want to help you, Oleg.</i>

23:38.598 --> 23:40.364
<i>I really do.</i>

23:40.652 --> 23:44.487
But... you know the situation.

23:47.379 --> 23:48.912
I can't.

23:55.315 --> 23:58.606
This... This sends you to jail.

23:58.758 --> 24:00.406
Twenty years. Thirty years.

24:00.446 --> 24:02.313
They don't care what I say.

24:04.697 --> 24:08.046
You have a wife. A son, you said.

24:08.147 --> 24:12.383
What's so important
that's worth throwing away...

24:19.164 --> 24:22.117
Everybody's here talking peace,

24:23.051 --> 24:25.428
but since you got to town,

24:25.518 --> 24:28.052
two of our agents
were killed in Chicago,

24:28.153 --> 24:31.864
one of our generals died
under suspicious circumstances,

24:32.011 --> 24:35.579
<i>three dead at a defense
contractor's warehouse...</i>

24:35.895 --> 24:37.795
<i>I could go on.</i>

24:39.298 --> 24:40.898
Peace?

24:44.070 --> 24:46.170
What's the dead drop say?

24:47.640 --> 24:49.073
Who sent it?

27:35.408 --> 27:37.608
People in the KGB

27:37.710 --> 27:40.311
are trying to get rid of Gorbachev.

27:47.286 --> 27:49.620
This is what I've been doing here.

27:50.550 --> 27:53.691
We have reason to believe
that they are trying

27:53.745 --> 27:57.180
to make a move right now,
around the Summit.

27:58.143 --> 28:00.753
The message... the dead drop...

28:00.778 --> 28:02.344
I don't know what it says,

28:02.455 --> 28:04.855
but it probably is about that.

28:05.089 --> 28:06.189
If it is...

28:06.285 --> 28:07.730
If...?

28:08.120 --> 28:09.619
They need to get it.

28:10.333 --> 28:12.890
You need to help me get it there.

28:13.365 --> 28:15.231
I can tell you how.

28:22.288 --> 28:26.548
You want me to send a coded message

28:26.719 --> 28:28.886
to the Soviet Union?

28:34.267 --> 28:36.233
Why don't you decode it?

28:37.402 --> 28:39.035
I can't.

28:40.746 --> 28:43.090
It can reveal who sent it.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.495
That's not your problem
right now, Oleg.

28:50.950 --> 28:55.075
We are looking for the illegals
here in D.C.

28:56.048 --> 28:58.314
You tell us how to get to them,

28:58.551 --> 29:00.250
you go home.

29:05.758 --> 29:07.090
I can't.

29:36.262 --> 29:38.896
Let me tell you something, Oleg.

29:38.998 --> 29:42.682
Your old buddies in the KGB
want to get rid of Gorbachev,

29:42.821 --> 29:44.787
I could give a shit.

29:55.448 --> 29:58.402
I can spend the rest of my life here.

29:58.810 --> 30:00.176
I don't know.

30:01.854 --> 30:03.594
But think about it.

30:04.056 --> 30:09.993
I have friends, a family...

30:10.096 --> 30:14.031
My father, my mother...

30:14.133 --> 30:16.977
My brother who died in the war...

30:17.856 --> 30:19.789
And all of us want a better future,

30:19.878 --> 30:21.311
just like you.

30:23.468 --> 30:25.051
Peace.

30:25.911 --> 30:27.384
Food to eat.

30:27.465 --> 30:29.799
All the same things.

30:32.418 --> 30:35.686
Do you think it doesn't matter
who our leader is?

30:37.790 --> 30:40.956
I'm telling you this is why I'm here.

30:41.593 --> 30:46.196
This is why I risked all of that,

30:46.432 --> 30:50.401
my wife, and my baby...

30:50.503 --> 30:53.003
Even though you told me not to.

30:55.274 --> 30:58.208
Can you get that into your thick head?

31:20.982 --> 31:22.978
I made ukha.

31:25.279 --> 31:26.599
No, thanks.

31:27.422 --> 31:29.855
Suit yourself.

31:30.308 --> 31:31.557
Sit.

31:33.261 --> 31:35.228
I'm not staying long.

31:42.685 --> 31:44.770
Nesterenko is alive.

31:45.974 --> 31:47.673
I stopped it.

31:50.397 --> 31:52.931
I also contacted Gorbachev's people.

31:54.702 --> 31:56.869
I told them everything
you were planning.

31:59.387 --> 32:00.686
It's over.

32:08.129 --> 32:10.329
Do you realize what you've done?

32:12.954 --> 32:15.421
They'll take apart
the Centre's leadership.

32:19.026 --> 32:22.027
The people who supported you
all these years.

32:23.785 --> 32:26.271
They'll put them in jail.

32:27.482 --> 32:29.348
All of us...

32:32.960 --> 32:35.728
There's still time for you to get out.

32:36.070 --> 32:37.988
Go somewhere.

32:38.993 --> 32:41.367
I'm sure you could get by anywhere.

32:42.530 --> 32:44.964
You think you're doing me a favor?

32:50.138 --> 32:53.372
I had so much faith in you.

32:56.411 --> 32:58.735
Even when things were...
bad, between us, I...

32:59.275 --> 33:02.915
Never lost faith. In you.

33:04.552 --> 33:05.751
You always reminded me

33:05.776 --> 33:08.179
of the women I fought with in the war.

33:08.922 --> 33:11.723
The way you put country over self.

33:16.064 --> 33:17.863
But now I see
you never really understood

33:17.912 --> 33:20.512
what you were fighting for.

33:22.737 --> 33:25.480
I'm still fighting for those things.

33:25.599 --> 33:27.999
Maybe you started too young.

33:32.654 --> 33:34.720
I thought I knew you...

33:34.768 --> 33:36.602
You lied to me.

33:36.818 --> 33:40.145
If you knew me,
you'd know never to lie to me.

33:40.240 --> 33:45.092
The work you put in,
the sacrifices you made.

33:45.720 --> 33:47.987
Our time with Paige.

33:48.615 --> 33:51.282
It was all for nothing, Elizabeth.

33:52.453 --> 33:54.753
You destroyed it all today.

33:56.571 --> 34:01.107
The damage you've done
is... indescribable.

34:02.465 --> 34:05.911
Far worse than all the good
you've done over these years.

34:10.385 --> 34:12.051
Where will you go?

34:13.353 --> 34:14.952
Back home...

34:17.112 --> 34:19.114
To fight for what's left of my country.

34:19.193 --> 34:20.830
I'm not afraid.

34:20.900 --> 34:22.800
We took it back
from our enemies before,

34:22.831 --> 34:24.764
we'll do it again.

34:27.601 --> 34:29.001
And you?

34:30.163 --> 34:32.197
What's left for you now?

34:35.109 --> 34:36.442
Your house?

34:38.380 --> 34:40.967
Your American kids?

34:41.616 --> 34:43.054
Philip?

35:59.827 --> 36:01.749
It's good to see you.

36:02.964 --> 36:05.822
Your wife wasn't sure it was possible.

36:06.060 --> 36:07.859
She couldn't make it today.

36:08.001 --> 36:09.392
Is she alright?

36:09.510 --> 36:10.758
Fine. Just... work.

36:10.864 --> 36:11.896
Mm.

36:14.575 --> 36:15.875
It's been a long time.

36:15.977 --> 36:18.511
- Mm.
- How are you?

36:21.849 --> 36:23.215
I don't know.

36:24.819 --> 36:26.786
Better in some ways.

36:30.658 --> 36:32.558
You've left the work behind.

36:35.062 --> 36:36.929
I don't miss it.

36:37.031 --> 36:38.191
It wasn't good for me.

36:38.258 --> 36:39.465
Mm.

36:43.738 --> 36:45.638
Quitting was never an option for me.

36:47.241 --> 36:49.141
I know.

36:59.220 --> 37:02.588
The two of you? Your marriage...?

37:04.537 --> 37:07.839
She thinks I broke
some of the vows I made.

37:08.235 --> 37:09.434
Did you?

37:12.225 --> 37:13.424
Yes.

37:14.635 --> 37:17.903
I haven't been as honest
with her as I should have been.

37:20.741 --> 37:22.808
I've been guiding married couples

37:22.910 --> 37:24.812
for a long time...

37:25.225 --> 37:28.993
And I've had the privilege
of talking to your wife

37:29.176 --> 37:31.176
several years now.

37:31.385 --> 37:33.852
She's not a person who trusts easily.

37:34.252 --> 37:35.855
No, she doesn't.

37:37.325 --> 37:40.226
Then there must be
something between you

37:40.267 --> 37:42.233
she thinks is worth staying for.

37:44.398 --> 37:46.009
Maybe.

37:46.500 --> 37:48.433
But she thinks bigger than that.

37:48.688 --> 37:50.054
What do you mean?

37:51.532 --> 37:54.099
She cares about... the whole world.

38:02.609 --> 38:05.343
What did you want to tell her today?

38:06.988 --> 38:09.221
I've heard a rumor that Father Victor

38:09.323 --> 38:11.891
was going to speak
to the American authorities.

38:16.531 --> 38:18.030
Which authorities?

38:18.255 --> 38:21.200
Uh, the FBI.

38:23.650 --> 38:25.450
When?

38:25.673 --> 38:27.773
Today, I think.

38:28.117 --> 38:30.656
Father Victor has always
been jealous of me.

38:31.546 --> 38:34.566
I think he suspects my ties
to your people back home.

38:36.350 --> 38:39.251
But really he's just looking
for a way to get rid of me.

38:43.524 --> 38:44.924
Am I in trouble?

38:45.026 --> 38:46.425
I'm always very careful.

38:47.728 --> 38:49.194
They may be watching us.

38:49.297 --> 38:50.596
If you don't get picked up,

38:50.644 --> 38:52.155
you should try and get home
as soon as possible.

38:52.206 --> 38:54.106
Buy a plane ticket today, if you can.

38:54.194 --> 38:55.560
Take care, Father.

39:50.577 --> 39:52.544
- Suspect on the move. He's on the move.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

40:48.863 --> 40:51.764
Hey. Queen Street. Northeast.

40:52.046 --> 40:53.412
Thanks.

41:13.261 --> 41:16.497
I didn't know you were coming over.

41:16.861 --> 41:18.265
Here I am.

41:24.223 --> 41:26.473
My friend Brian came over last night.

41:26.912 --> 41:29.109
The intern you thought
I slept with to get...

41:29.211 --> 41:30.110
Paige...

41:30.212 --> 41:31.766
We actually like each other.

41:31.840 --> 41:33.273
Just so you know.

41:35.597 --> 41:36.963
Okay.

41:40.723 --> 41:44.625
He'd been at this party
with a bunch of other interns.

41:44.938 --> 41:46.994
He was telling me
about this one guy there,

41:47.210 --> 41:48.896
he didn't really know him that well,

41:49.276 --> 41:52.024
but he was really drunk, throwing up...

41:52.275 --> 41:55.616
It got so bad
Brian and some of his friends

41:55.641 --> 41:59.820
were trying to help, like,
get him in a cab and get home.

42:00.300 --> 42:04.201
And this kid is falling
all over himself,

42:04.387 --> 42:07.454
sick, and crying,

42:07.722 --> 42:09.656
and he starts talking about

42:09.851 --> 42:12.084
how he slept with this older woman.

42:14.790 --> 42:18.992
He felt like she tricked him
or something.

42:19.301 --> 42:21.634
He said she ruined his life.

42:23.365 --> 42:25.498
Now he's quitting and going home.

42:28.530 --> 42:30.530
He works for Sam Nunn.

42:32.140 --> 42:35.608
This happens right in the middle
of the Summit.

42:39.427 --> 42:41.294
Was it you?

42:44.466 --> 42:46.466
Don't be ridiculous.

42:49.498 --> 42:50.997
Was it?

42:52.715 --> 42:53.880
No.

43:00.063 --> 43:01.869
It was all in that book.

43:02.709 --> 43:04.752
And the way you got
so weird about Brian.

43:04.777 --> 43:05.951
We talked about that book.

43:05.976 --> 43:08.584
If you lie to me now, after everything,

43:08.627 --> 43:10.527
I will never forgive you.

43:11.184 --> 43:12.476
Paige...

43:12.798 --> 43:15.065
I swear to you I'm not.

43:22.195 --> 43:23.657
Looking back...

43:23.715 --> 43:25.515
I've always known, Mom.

43:27.059 --> 43:31.758
Every time, every lie, my whole life.

43:32.865 --> 43:34.673
And I know now.

43:35.134 --> 43:37.301
I had nothing to do with that boy.

43:37.477 --> 43:40.544
No wonder Dad can't stand
to be in the same room with you.

43:40.806 --> 43:41.872
Excuse me?

43:41.897 --> 43:43.363
You lie about everything...

43:43.450 --> 43:45.750
- Paige...
- How many times? How many men?

43:45.785 --> 43:47.685
Were you doing this when I was a baby?

43:47.747 --> 43:49.113
You're a whore!

43:49.208 --> 43:50.841
Does Dad know he married a whore...

43:50.866 --> 43:52.367
- Stop it...
- Why?

43:52.592 --> 43:53.857
You don't want to know the truth?

43:53.960 --> 43:56.794
The truth is that moment
you told me who you really are,

43:56.855 --> 43:58.572
I should have done what Henry did...

43:58.610 --> 44:00.577
Get as far away from you as possible.

44:00.602 --> 44:01.868
That's enough!

44:08.521 --> 44:10.354
It doesn't mean anything to me.

44:11.471 --> 44:13.880
I wasn't brought up like you were.

44:14.727 --> 44:16.060
I had to fight.

44:16.115 --> 44:18.248
Always. For everything.

44:19.525 --> 44:22.125
People were killed,
they died, all around me.

44:22.388 --> 44:23.554
If I had to give everything

44:23.579 --> 44:25.413
so that my country would survive,

44:25.484 --> 44:27.133
so that it would never happen again,

44:27.179 --> 44:28.445
I would do it gladly.

44:28.470 --> 44:31.004
We were proud to do whatever we could.

44:32.519 --> 44:33.597
Sex?

44:33.646 --> 44:36.424
What was sex?

44:36.528 --> 44:38.728
Nobody cared.

44:38.844 --> 44:41.278
Including your father.

45:03.602 --> 45:06.703
Every garage that's still
on the list, get there now.

45:06.805 --> 45:09.005
Every suspected safehouse, same thing.

45:09.187 --> 45:10.987
If you were assigned
to utility records,

45:11.012 --> 45:12.758
phone records, cold case files,

45:12.784 --> 45:15.518
you're on garages or safehouses now.

45:20.553 --> 45:22.719
We're assuming if he's running,
that's where he goes?

45:23.015 --> 45:25.592
We're hoping. He doesn't know
we know about them.

45:25.658 --> 45:27.024
Surveillance photos?

45:27.073 --> 45:28.439
Not in yet...

45:28.747 --> 45:29.879
Ganzel.

45:29.961 --> 45:31.361
When's the priest getting here?

45:31.386 --> 45:32.919
Ten minutes.

45:52.050 --> 45:54.951
You must make the right choices
over there.

45:55.587 --> 45:57.844
But the most important thing...

45:58.289 --> 46:01.648
We do not want you to lose who you are.

46:46.786 --> 46:48.118
Hello?

46:48.879 --> 46:52.224
Hi, I was hoping
to make it home for dinner,

46:52.271 --> 46:55.339
but things are very topsy-turvy
at the office.

47:00.206 --> 47:02.440
I'm sorry to hear that.

47:02.816 --> 47:05.015
<i>Try not to wake me up when you come in.</i>
