19:09.524 --> 19:11.818
will I have
to slap down this time?

19:11.860 --> 19:13.987
-Standing.
-For?

19:14.028 --> 19:15.446
My client, Detective Bosch.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.948
(chuckles)

19:16.990 --> 19:19.033
Too easy. Your client has none.

19:19.075 --> 19:21.369
But if we did?

19:21.411 --> 19:23.246
(inhales)
Yeah?

19:23.288 --> 19:26.416
We can show that the supposedly
dispositive evidence

19:26.457 --> 19:29.377
on offer
from Mr. Cronyn is bogus.

19:29.419 --> 19:32.338
Thank you for not springing that
on me in court.

19:32.380 --> 19:35.300
I assume you'd rather not
reverse yourself.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.927
(scoffs) Oh, I've got no problem
with that.

19:37.969 --> 19:40.013
If I screwed up
at the first trial,

19:40.054 --> 19:42.307
this is a chance
to get it right.

19:42.348 --> 19:45.560
That said...

19:45.602 --> 19:48.646
I'd love to see what the hell
you've got up your sleeve.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.565
I appreciate that, Donna.

19:50.607 --> 19:54.193
You'll need strong legal
justification for your request.

19:54.235 --> 19:56.905
-I'll have it.
-Or I will slap it down.

19:56.946 --> 19:59.324
I'd expect nothing less.

19:59.365 --> 20:02.035
Your Honor.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.893
(lock buzzes)

20:26.935 --> 20:28.645
BORDERS:
How in the hell

20:28.686 --> 20:30.563
did they find my wife?

20:30.605 --> 20:32.482
Public records.

20:32.523 --> 20:35.610
A wonder
it didn't come out before now.

20:35.652 --> 20:37.612
Surprised
the judge doesn't know.

20:37.654 --> 20:39.155
Nobody knows!

20:39.197 --> 20:40.448
She kept her maiden name.

20:40.490 --> 20:42.909
Why didn't you use the knife?

20:42.951 --> 20:43.910
Knife?

20:43.952 --> 20:46.120
The confession!

20:47.830 --> 20:50.208
Had I known, I would have.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.293
Either your wife forgot
to mention it,

20:52.335 --> 20:55.296
or you forgot to tell her.

20:55.338 --> 20:57.715
Yeah, well, Bosch and his lawyer

20:57.757 --> 20:59.926
can drive a truck
through that hole!

20:59.968 --> 21:02.261
-Bosch has no say
in this proceeding.
-(chuckles): Yeah,

21:02.303 --> 21:04.472
-well, he sure
doesn't act like it.
-Law is clear.

21:04.514 --> 21:06.933
No seat at the table.
He's a helpless spectator

21:06.975 --> 21:09.602
watching his career
crash and burn.

21:11.396 --> 21:13.398
This time next year,

21:13.439 --> 21:16.859
you'll be on a beach somewhere
counting your money.

21:19.153 --> 21:22.281
That's exactly what Rita said.

21:22.323 --> 21:24.325
Did you tell her that, too?

21:24.367 --> 21:27.537
Didn't have to. She's right.

21:32.625 --> 21:36.004
The task force inventory
of Skyler's jewelry.

21:36.045 --> 21:37.630
Thanks.

21:37.672 --> 21:39.298
Can I ask why you're interested?

21:39.340 --> 21:41.968
Constructing a timeline.

21:42.010 --> 21:44.387
The inventory was done
after the family was interviewed

21:44.429 --> 21:46.472
and before Borders was arrested.

21:46.514 --> 21:50.143
Her apartment, her family's
home, their safe deposit box.

21:50.184 --> 21:51.561
No pendant.

21:51.602 --> 21:53.896
Borders took it
when he killed her.

21:53.938 --> 21:56.190
That's the story.

21:56.232 --> 21:58.026
(phone ringing)

21:58.067 --> 22:00.445
-CIU. Henry.
-ANDERSON: Ms. Henry.

22:00.486 --> 22:02.405
Scott Anderson, Times.

22:02.447 --> 22:04.866
-What can I do for you?
-I'm working a story

22:04.907 --> 22:07.326
on the Preston Borders
habeas hearing.

22:07.368 --> 22:09.412
You know I can't talk about it.

22:09.454 --> 22:11.539
Off the record?

22:13.458 --> 22:16.252
-Off the record?
-Completely.

22:16.294 --> 22:18.004
Off the record,
I can't talk about it.

22:18.046 --> 22:20.506
-You're no fun.
-Sorry to disappoint.

22:20.548 --> 22:23.968
Do you need the D.A.'s
media relations number?

22:24.010 --> 22:25.970
I know it by heart.

22:26.012 --> 22:28.765
If you change your mind,
call the Times' switchboard.

22:28.806 --> 22:31.559
They'll connect you 24/7,
off the rec...

22:31.601 --> 22:33.770
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

22:33.811 --> 22:35.813
(scoffs)

22:37.607 --> 22:39.400
-What did Scott Anderson want?
-MILLER: A sit-down,

22:39.442 --> 22:41.819
face-to-face,
in-depth interview with you.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.571
-About?
-Preston Borders.

22:44.614 --> 22:46.657
Harry Bosch's name came up, too.

22:48.242 --> 22:49.827
(sighs)

22:53.748 --> 22:55.792
Tell the Times
that we trust the process

22:55.833 --> 22:58.836
and will have no comment until
the court makes its decision.

23:00.463 --> 23:02.048
Chief.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.012
(door closes)

23:12.642 --> 23:14.477
(ringtone playing)

23:16.938 --> 23:19.148
-Yes, Chief.
-Lieutenant,

23:19.190 --> 23:20.274
where is Detective Bosch?

23:20.316 --> 23:21.442
He's not returning my calls.

23:21.484 --> 23:23.111
In the field.

23:23.152 --> 23:25.488
This pharmacy homicide's
got us stretched.

23:25.530 --> 23:27.740
Don't dance with me, Lieutenant,
I'm not in the mood.

23:27.782 --> 23:29.742
Oh, no, sir.
I wouldn't dream of it.

23:29.784 --> 23:31.202
I need to speak with him.

23:31.244 --> 23:33.162
I'll tell him
the first chance I get.

23:33.204 --> 23:34.956
As soon as possible.

23:34.997 --> 23:36.707
Understood.

23:40.837 --> 23:42.421
(whispers):
Fuck.

23:42.463 --> 23:45.758
(yawns)

23:45.800 --> 23:48.261
Hey.

24:08.656 --> 24:10.700
What the fuck?

24:17.623 --> 24:20.626
-Get away from me!
-What? Jesus.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.379
Okay.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.766
That lady with the short skirt,

24:35.808 --> 24:38.561
she just put something
in her backpack.

24:39.562 --> 24:41.939
(sighs)

24:41.981 --> 24:43.399
Whoa, whoa, miss.
Hold on a second.

24:43.441 --> 24:45.067
-What?
-What do you got in your bag?

24:45.109 --> 24:46.235
My stuff.

24:46.277 --> 24:48.362
Mind if I take a look?

24:56.704 --> 24:58.748
The fuck's going on?
That's not mine.

24:58.789 --> 25:00.875
Mrs. Monroe, you want
to call the police, please?

25:00.917 --> 25:02.376
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Let go of me!

25:02.418 --> 25:04.128
-I didn't take anything!
-This is, like,

25:04.170 --> 25:05.463
$80 worth of Lancôme.

25:05.504 --> 25:08.466
Hey, man.
That Elizabeth chick

25:08.507 --> 25:10.843
just got popped
for boosting shit.

25:10.885 --> 25:12.845
They're calling the cops.

25:12.887 --> 25:14.263
Fuck.

25:15.598 --> 25:17.391
Get in the van.

25:17.433 --> 25:18.643
We're leaving.

25:18.684 --> 25:20.269
Hey. Everyone?
Van's leaving.

25:20.311 --> 25:22.313
Let's go. Move it.

25:31.614 --> 25:33.115
Let's go.

25:50.007 --> 25:51.842
(engine starts)

25:59.684 --> 26:01.477
On the corner.

26:01.519 --> 26:02.937
Gray with white trim.

26:32.717 --> 26:34.552
(sighs)
Shall we do this?

26:34.593 --> 26:36.971
Let's sit here
for a few minutes,

26:37.013 --> 26:39.765
get the lay of the land.

26:39.807 --> 26:41.684
My old partner.

26:41.726 --> 26:43.811
Lugs a milk crate to the scene,

26:43.853 --> 26:45.438
sits on it...

26:45.479 --> 26:47.106
and just looks.

26:47.148 --> 26:49.400
VEGA:
I get that with a murder victim

26:49.442 --> 26:51.402
who's not going anywhere, but...

26:51.444 --> 26:53.612
-Patience, Grasshopper.
-(laughs)

26:53.654 --> 26:55.281
He say that, too?

26:55.323 --> 26:57.450
Those very words.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.640
(dishes clattering)

27:31.901 --> 27:33.569
-Who was that?
-Street source.

27:33.611 --> 27:36.489
Runs a chain of 7-Elevens
in the South Bay.

27:36.530 --> 27:39.241
-Legit?
-Can't prove he isn't.

27:39.283 --> 27:42.161
Long way to come for coffee.

27:42.203 --> 27:44.038
MARCOS: Well, he comes
for the café au lait

27:44.080 --> 27:45.581
and the beignets--
reminds him of home.

27:45.623 --> 27:47.416
-New Orleans?
-Haiti.

27:47.458 --> 27:49.752
-Haiti?
-Not a lot of Haitians in L.A.

27:49.794 --> 27:51.045
No, there aren't.

27:51.087 --> 27:52.463
So, what's up?

27:52.505 --> 27:54.548
Gary Wise.

27:54.590 --> 27:56.926
RHD's still working
the gang angle.

27:56.967 --> 27:58.511
So we hear.

27:58.552 --> 28:02.056
I think Bo Jonas was there
when Gary was killed.

28:02.098 --> 28:04.892
Witness saw him
fleeing the scene.

28:04.934 --> 28:07.228
You think Jonas did Gary Wise?

28:07.269 --> 28:08.604
I don't know.

28:08.646 --> 28:10.648
She said he was running scared.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.233
She?

28:12.274 --> 28:14.360
-Witness.
-We talk to her?

28:14.402 --> 28:17.279
-I'll text you her info.
-You still watching

28:17.321 --> 28:19.907
your girlish figure,
or can we buy you a beignet?

28:19.949 --> 28:22.535
Sure.

28:22.576 --> 28:24.787
-Your source, what's his name?
-ARIAS: Avril.

28:24.829 --> 28:27.915
Jacques Avril.
People call him Jackie April.

28:27.957 --> 28:29.667
(French accent):
Ah-vreel.

28:29.708 --> 28:32.420
Ah-vreel. Whatever.
Does it ring a bell or...?

28:33.462 --> 28:34.547
No.

28:34.588 --> 28:36.006
PIERCE:
You have a husband

28:36.048 --> 28:37.383
and a boyfriend?

28:38.426 --> 28:40.177
I'm polyamorous.

28:42.972 --> 28:45.391
I don't believe relationships
have to be binary.

28:48.185 --> 28:50.563
And your husband's okay
with that?

28:50.604 --> 28:53.274
Mm-hmm.
He has a boyfriend, too.

28:56.777 --> 28:58.070
(chuckles)

29:01.115 --> 29:02.241
What do you think?

29:10.291 --> 29:13.169
I think that's him.

29:15.129 --> 29:18.048
If it's him, he'll be back.

29:23.929 --> 29:26.474
Here's Johnny.

29:28.392 --> 29:30.895
And it's definitely him.

29:30.936 --> 29:33.397
PIERCE: Jam him now
or after he gets out?

29:33.439 --> 29:36.317
Either way we could lose Junior.
Let's get some help.

29:44.700 --> 29:46.410
This is Detective
Christina Vega, LAPD.

29:46.452 --> 29:48.871
Partner and I are
on a 187 wit's house.

29:48.913 --> 29:51.665
Suspicious vehicle occupied
by a lone male white

29:51.707 --> 29:53.459
watching target's residence.

29:53.501 --> 29:54.710
Believe armed.

29:54.752 --> 29:57.421
Need a unit
at 5800 Goodman Street.

29:57.463 --> 29:59.757
Appreciate it.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.635
VEGA:
Uh-oh.

30:06.764 --> 30:08.516
Hoodie in this heat?

30:08.557 --> 30:10.017
PIERCE:
Bogie's out.

30:10.059 --> 30:13.020
Go, go, go!
Straight at him.

30:15.564 --> 30:17.691
Police! Let me see your hands!

30:17.733 --> 30:20.194
Let me see your fucking hands!

30:20.236 --> 30:21.904
Drop the gun.

30:21.946 --> 30:23.656
Not gonna tell you again.

30:23.697 --> 30:26.450
Drop the gun.
Get your fucking hands up.

30:28.285 --> 30:29.119
Now!

30:37.461 --> 30:40.422
Keep your hands up.

30:40.464 --> 30:42.967
Slowly turn around.
Face away from me.

30:43.008 --> 30:45.052
(siren approaching in distance)

30:47.638 --> 30:49.848
Back up.
Away from the gun.

30:51.141 --> 30:52.560
Now get down on your knees.

30:54.353 --> 30:56.605
Get down on your stomach.

30:56.647 --> 30:59.608
Head to the left and down flat.

30:59.650 --> 31:00.901
We got a runner!

31:00.943 --> 31:04.321
-I got him!
-(tires squeal)

31:13.289 --> 31:15.124
Who knew you were so ballsy?

31:15.165 --> 31:17.543
I'm just getting started.

31:17.585 --> 31:19.587
Officer Robson
should have had a rep with him.

31:19.628 --> 31:20.921
For a casual conversation

31:20.963 --> 31:22.506
between an officer
and his chief?

31:22.548 --> 31:25.009
Robson took it to be more
than that, a lot more.

31:25.050 --> 31:26.385
You can understand our concern.

31:26.427 --> 31:28.262
-It's unfounded.
-GORDON: Chief,

31:28.304 --> 31:29.722
anything Officer Robson said
to you...

31:29.763 --> 31:31.432
Will be held
in strictest confidence.

31:31.473 --> 31:33.225
Frankly,
I don't see a problem here.

31:33.267 --> 31:36.228
Two of the three members of the
Board of Rights are captains.

31:36.270 --> 31:38.439
Their careers are in your hands.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.399
Hard for them to be impartial.

31:40.441 --> 31:43.652
Look, once the D.A.
reaches her decision,

31:43.694 --> 31:45.738
the department
will act accordingly.

31:47.531 --> 31:49.950
There will be no rush
to judgment.

31:49.992 --> 31:52.453
Thank you, Chief.

31:52.494 --> 31:54.496
Thank you.

31:57.207 --> 31:59.877
-So, this is from CompStat?
-Yeah.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.630
Delgado was droning on
about tracking clusters.

32:02.671 --> 32:04.673
BFMVs, thefts,

32:04.715 --> 32:07.343
-robberies...
-Unique MOs, weapons used,
time of day.

32:07.384 --> 32:09.345
-Yeah. All right.
-Know that lecture by heart.

32:09.386 --> 32:10.679
So, we know
where the numbers are down.

32:10.721 --> 32:13.265
Pacific, Wilshire, Hollywood.

32:13.307 --> 32:14.767
Know why they're down
in Hollywood.

32:14.808 --> 32:16.352
Yes. Well,
I did a little digging

32:16.393 --> 32:18.729
into Pacific and Wilshire,
and guess what.

32:18.771 --> 32:20.731
Same reason.

32:20.773 --> 32:23.025
Somebody wants rosier stats.

32:23.067 --> 32:24.526
Several somebodies.

32:24.568 --> 32:26.070
Cooper?

32:26.111 --> 32:27.780
No, not just Cooper.

32:28.781 --> 32:31.033
How far up the chain?

32:31.075 --> 32:33.285
Well, at least West Bureau
or operations director.

32:33.327 --> 32:36.121
That is a whole nother pay grade
of shit to wade through.

32:36.163 --> 32:37.748
Yeah.

32:37.790 --> 32:40.250
I don't know that I have waders
that are that high.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.252
You fish?

32:42.294 --> 32:45.631
-It's a figure of speech, Mank.
-Oh.

32:45.673 --> 32:47.424
-(knock on door)
-Open.

32:49.468 --> 32:51.428
-MANKIEWICZ: Madeline Bosch.
-Hi.

32:51.470 --> 32:54.139
-Hi. All right.
-Thanks, Mank.

32:54.181 --> 32:56.642
Keeping banker's hours down
at the D.A.'s office?

32:56.684 --> 32:58.352
Yeah. They sent me
on a Westside run,

32:58.394 --> 33:00.479
so I thought I'd stop in,
see if I could catch my dad.

33:00.521 --> 33:02.940
Yeah. He's still under, Mads.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.859
I mean, sometimes
this is the way it works.

33:05.901 --> 33:07.277
Okay.

33:07.319 --> 33:08.946
As soon as he checks in,
I will...

33:08.987 --> 33:11.407
-He's okay?
-Yeah.

33:11.448 --> 33:14.326
What if he doesn't check in?

33:14.368 --> 33:17.496
We go Code Red. Every cop
in the city is on the case.

33:17.538 --> 33:19.456
If he's even in the city.

33:19.498 --> 33:21.125
Why do you say that?

33:22.167 --> 33:24.044
I have a hunch.

33:24.086 --> 33:28.173
You are
your father's daughter, huh?

33:28.215 --> 33:31.051
Don't worry. He's fine.

33:49.319 --> 33:51.655
(dog growling, barking)

33:52.740 --> 33:54.324
Fuck away from me.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.368
(barking continues)

33:59.037 --> 34:01.373
-No, no, no! No, no, no. No.
-(dog whimpering)

34:01.415 --> 34:04.251
It's okay. It's okay.
What the fuck?

34:04.293 --> 34:07.796
You can't shoot a dog, man.
It's bad luck.

34:16.638 --> 34:19.391
-I'll shoot
what the fuck I want.
-I got it.

34:21.935 --> 34:23.395
Fuck you looking at?

34:23.437 --> 34:27.399
It's okay. It's okay.

34:27.441 --> 34:29.151
Never heard of Jose Esquivel?

34:29.193 --> 34:32.196
Father and son?
Esquivel Farmacia?

34:32.237 --> 34:34.239
Even though you drove
all the way from L.A.

34:34.281 --> 34:36.116
with a Glock and suppressor
to their cousin's house?

34:38.952 --> 34:40.913
We know a lot about you already.

34:40.954 --> 34:42.915
Wilbur Hart.

34:42.956 --> 34:44.875
Ex-con. Parolee.

34:44.917 --> 34:48.003
About to be violated back
to prison on a gun charge.

34:48.045 --> 34:49.463
The least of his problems.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.058
I've never seen him before.

35:01.099 --> 35:03.060
You sure?

35:04.102 --> 35:07.815
Yeah. Sorry.

35:07.856 --> 35:10.859
We're taking you back to L.A.

35:12.945 --> 35:14.571
-Reilly.
-Yeah?

35:14.613 --> 35:15.906
Boss man wants a word.

35:15.948 --> 35:17.950
Be right there.

35:26.834 --> 35:29.336
I don't fucking know.
Says he's stuck in Sky Harbor.

35:29.378 --> 35:32.214
You kidding me?

35:32.256 --> 35:35.509
We are ready to move now,
as in right fucking now!

35:35.551 --> 35:37.302
And you recommended
this asshole.

35:37.344 --> 35:39.054
It's the fucking heat, man.

35:39.096 --> 35:41.139
Can't take off when there's
not enough thrust for thin air.

35:41.181 --> 35:44.101
Does he have an idea when?

35:44.142 --> 35:47.104
Tonight. Soon as the temp
drops below 110.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.773
Be in Glamis with the keys
first thing.

35:49.815 --> 35:51.441
(knock on door)

35:51.483 --> 35:53.986
Fuck.

35:59.783 --> 36:01.159
Now he's a dog whisperer.

36:03.203 --> 36:05.581
You don't shoot the dog
is all I'm saying.

36:05.622 --> 36:08.083
Man's best friend.

36:08.125 --> 36:11.670
And besides saving strays,
what else have you been up to?

36:14.715 --> 36:17.050
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

36:17.092 --> 36:20.095
Trey claims you engineered

36:20.137 --> 36:22.389
the monkey business
at the pharmacy.

36:22.431 --> 36:24.308
Got the girl arrested.

36:24.349 --> 36:25.809
You believe him?

36:25.851 --> 36:28.604
Our skepticism
is why you're here.

36:33.317 --> 36:34.776
Listening.

36:34.818 --> 36:37.321
He and the Clayton chick,

36:37.362 --> 36:39.489
they're running a grift.

36:39.531 --> 36:40.532
Then why set the girl up?

36:40.574 --> 36:42.826
Fuck do I know? Ask him.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.997
I am growing weary of you.

36:47.039 --> 36:50.125
So send me home.

36:54.129 --> 36:56.089
Get out.

37:02.137 --> 37:04.723
Jesus Christ, man.

37:04.765 --> 37:06.725
Glad we're moving away
from all this shit.

37:06.767 --> 37:08.769
No more shills.

37:10.771 --> 37:13.732
Give Trey...

37:13.774 --> 37:15.359
a final run bonus.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.361
He can kill himself for us.

37:17.402 --> 37:20.155
And Reilly?

37:20.197 --> 37:24.368
Is he smart enough
to be of some further use to us?

37:24.409 --> 37:27.746
Or too smart
to be of use to anyone?

37:27.788 --> 37:30.207
Hmm?

37:30.248 --> 37:32.250
(indistinct chatter)

37:52.646 --> 37:55.607
-You all right?
-Everyone's been really nice.

37:55.649 --> 37:57.109
Well, why wouldn't they be?

37:58.819 --> 38:00.779
You have a wonderful family.

38:00.821 --> 38:04.700
I'm related
to way too many lawyers.

38:05.742 --> 38:07.744
Well, what's your family like?

38:09.746 --> 38:12.749
You know, smaller.

38:14.876 --> 38:16.837
Where's the, um...?

38:16.878 --> 38:20.966
Oh, it's, uh, just right around
the corner on the left.

38:50.620 --> 38:52.622
(indistinct chatter)

39:12.309 --> 39:14.311
(insects trilling)

39:40.128 --> 39:42.881
(ringtone plays)

39:42.923 --> 39:44.466
-Edgar.
-MAN (over phone): Detective.

39:44.508 --> 39:46.384
Officer John Zepponi,
Tehachapi Police.

39:46.426 --> 39:48.345
-What can I do for you?
-We arrested a woman

39:48.386 --> 39:50.347
for shoplifting.
Elizabeth Clayton?

39:50.388 --> 39:52.015
I don't know the name.

39:52.057 --> 39:53.725
We found a note in her pocket.

39:53.767 --> 39:56.520
-Uh, it says to call you.
-Who's the note from?

39:56.561 --> 39:58.730
No idea. Note says,
"You'll know what to do.

39:58.772 --> 40:00.398
Hold Fast."

40:00.440 --> 40:02.526
I'm on my way.

40:02.567 --> 40:05.153
You're coming to Tehachapi? Now?
It's a two-hour drive.

40:05.195 --> 40:06.822
Text me your location.

40:31.096 --> 40:33.098
♪ ♪

40:41.148 --> 40:43.400
(indistinct chatter)

40:43.441 --> 40:45.443
(music playing)

41:13.847 --> 41:16.308
-Cheers.
-Yeah, cheers.

41:18.310 --> 41:19.728
ANDERSON:
He hasn't returned a call

41:19.769 --> 41:21.354
in two days.

41:21.396 --> 41:23.356
You're sure the rest
of the story is solid?

41:23.398 --> 41:26.193
-Like LeBron.
-On a good night or a bad night?

41:26.234 --> 41:28.069
LeBron doesn't have bad nights.

41:28.111 --> 41:30.280
-And now that he's a Laker...
-I'm a Clippers fan.

41:30.322 --> 41:32.699
Ooh, I pity you.

41:32.741 --> 41:35.327
(sighs) We gonna run it?

41:35.368 --> 41:37.996
Since when do we not run a story
because the principal subject

41:38.038 --> 41:40.290
of that story
is ducking our calls?

41:40.332 --> 41:42.000
Of course.

41:42.042 --> 41:43.501
We're gonna run it.

41:43.543 --> 41:45.503
-With a photo.
-Of Borders?

41:45.545 --> 41:47.547
Of Bosch.
