16:24.183 --> 16:27.053
Worked at some of the top
media companies in the world,

16:27.053 --> 16:30.356
and all of that has been
a culmination to where I am now,

16:30.356 --> 16:32.892
to where we're able to handle
a big task like this.

16:32.892 --> 16:35.228
You know, the reason why we got
a Space Act agreement ‐‐

16:35.228 --> 16:37.463
because we presented
the best argument

16:37.463 --> 16:39.465
and the best strategy
to NASA,

16:39.465 --> 16:41.868
to where they trusted us to give
us that Space Act agreement.

16:41.868 --> 16:43.603
You guys keep on
going back to that.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.338
Okay, we know that, right?
‐We've heard that.

16:45.338 --> 16:48.241
At some point, we want
to invest in a business.

16:48.241 --> 16:51.811
Yennie: Yeah, right.
Well, we've opened up
a 5,000‐square‐foot laboratory

16:51.811 --> 16:53.412
to get things started.

16:53.412 --> 16:56.115
So that is the infrastructure
for the tire business.

16:56.115 --> 17:00.686
So we're buying equipment,
we're hiring people.
To do what?

17:00.686 --> 17:04.757
To do work, to build prototypes,
to continue ‐‐
To make the bicycle tire.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.392
Our first product
is the bicycle tire.
Yennie:
To bridge the gap between ‐‐

17:06.392 --> 17:09.896
Do you get to go to
the car tire in your deal?

17:09.896 --> 17:12.765
So how we get to the car tire ‐‐
Couple of things.

17:12.765 --> 17:15.201
There's a reason
we're very focused

17:15.201 --> 17:16.669
on the rubber
integration.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.971
Now, yes, there's some big
tire companies out there.

17:18.971 --> 17:21.807
They have a lot of resources.
Absolutely competition.

17:21.807 --> 17:25.011
If they can't put rubber
on a tire,

17:25.011 --> 17:26.112
they're not putting it on
their own.

17:26.112 --> 17:27.613
So you're saying
you could corner it

17:27.613 --> 17:29.949
and they'd have to pay you
a royalty to build their line

17:29.949 --> 17:31.617
of big brand tires.

17:31.617 --> 17:33.786
Is that the strategy?
Essentially, yeah.

17:33.786 --> 17:36.322
That's our IP...versus
big and small.
And you are patenting it, right?

17:36.322 --> 17:38.090
So we're patent pending
on that.

17:38.090 --> 17:39.725
Okay, how much are they going
to cost for me?

17:39.725 --> 17:42.461
We're still optimizing
the product, the final product.

17:42.461 --> 17:44.063
Like, we're still
early stage,

17:44.063 --> 17:46.198
we're pre‐revenue,
but we're optimizing everything.

17:46.198 --> 17:48.167
We want to do this correct.
Are they gonna be five times
the price of a regular tire?

17:48.167 --> 17:50.603
‐Okay, look, look, listen ‐‐
‐Not five times, yeah.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.805
Hart: Let's focus on
one thing, right?
Yeah.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.674
What does it cost you
to make the tire?

17:54.674 --> 17:57.743
I want to start here.
Yeah, absolutely.

17:57.743 --> 18:02.615
The tire, the Nitinol material
costs about $150 a pound.

18:02.615 --> 18:05.851
Cuban: So, we don't know what
that means.
What does that mean?

18:05.851 --> 18:07.853
How many pounds in a tire?
Cole: To make one tire ‐‐

18:07.853 --> 18:10.323
Right. So, to make one tire...
Break it down for me.

18:10.323 --> 18:11.958
...you need to be
under a pound.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.960
You're going to have
a heavy tire, for a bicycle.
Listen to me. Listen.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.095
Yes.
I don't know NASA.

18:16.095 --> 18:20.066
I don't know. I'm ‐‐ I'm lost
at that language, right?

18:20.066 --> 18:22.868
Yes. Yeah.
Give me a simplistic answer.

18:22.868 --> 18:27.173
How much money does it cost
to make that thing right there?

18:27.173 --> 18:28.574
That thing right there...
How much?

18:28.574 --> 18:31.811
...costs us around $150, $200.
$150?

18:31.811 --> 18:33.045
Hart: So how much you gonna
sell it for?

18:33.045 --> 18:36.616
Right. So we're going to sell
wheel sets to begin with

18:36.616 --> 18:39.585
because it's a premium product
integrated with carbon fiber.

18:39.585 --> 18:41.654
You better believe
it's a premium product.

18:41.654 --> 18:42.955
And how much are you going
to sell them for?

18:42.955 --> 18:44.924
The wheel set
will be around $2,500,

18:44.924 --> 18:46.592
$3,000 for the wheel set.

18:46.592 --> 18:47.727
Oh!

18:47.727 --> 18:50.663
Whoa, I could buy
a bicycle for that!

18:50.663 --> 18:52.598

you didn't want to tell us.

Narrator:
All Sharks are still in,

19:05.177 --> 19:07.013
but they're concerned about
the high cost

19:07.013 --> 19:09.081
and lack
of a clear business plan

19:09.081 --> 19:12.918
for Brian and Earl's tires made
from space‐age technology,

19:12.918 --> 19:14.286
The SMART Tire.

19:14.286 --> 19:17.323
Right now, the goal is
to eventually get to cars.

19:17.323 --> 19:20.960
If you're selling these, a set
for a bike, at $2,500, $3,000,

19:20.960 --> 19:23.963
when you get to cars,
what are we selling it for?
A million?

19:23.963 --> 19:27.099
Are you talking about
15 to 20 grand for a set?

19:27.099 --> 19:28.801
10 grand?
How much is this?

19:28.801 --> 19:31.370
No, that's not the plan.
So when we get to cars,
we'd be selling just the tire.

19:31.370 --> 19:33.873
So if you imagine
this tire right here,

19:33.873 --> 19:37.943
this would cost around
$700, $800 for the tire,

19:37.943 --> 19:40.279
which matches up
with like a sport,

19:40.279 --> 19:41.514
you know, high‐end tire.

We're just not there yet.

19:42.982 --> 19:47.353
You know, listen, guys, I think
the concept is really smart.

19:47.353 --> 19:48.954
Tires are a pain in the ass.

19:48.954 --> 19:50.890
I mean, nobody wants to have
to fill them with air.

19:50.890 --> 19:54.326
Nobody wants to come back
and find their tire's flat.

19:54.326 --> 19:57.797
But it's just right now,
you're too early for me.

19:57.797 --> 20:01.167
I'm regretfully out.

20:01.167 --> 20:04.403
Look, you guys had
this NASA opportunity.

20:04.403 --> 20:06.672
‐You grabbed it, right?
‐Yeah, mm‐hmm.

20:06.672 --> 20:08.708
Can't blame any entrepreneur
for wanting that.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.377
Now you have this big vision
that you put up on

20:11.377 --> 20:15.047
this equity crowdfunding site,
and you sold the big vision.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.882
Great. Now you figure you get
onto "Shark Tank,"

20:16.882 --> 20:19.852
and you're trying to sell
the shiny object, big vision.

20:19.852 --> 20:21.620
You have done nothing
to prove to us

20:21.620 --> 20:24.290

that big vision.

So the only comment left is,
I'm out.

20:34.734 --> 20:38.337
You know, guys, I don't
agree on your strategy.

20:38.337 --> 20:39.839
I agree
the technology works.

20:39.839 --> 20:42.775
It's intriguing,
but the world does not need

20:42.775 --> 20:45.511
another tire manufacturing
distribution company.

20:45.511 --> 20:48.647
They already exist.
It's a very mature market.

20:48.647 --> 20:52.351
And so at the end of the day,
the strategy should be that

20:52.351 --> 20:53.652
if you've lock up
these rights,

20:53.652 --> 20:56.522
why don't you go
to a giant tire manufacturer

20:56.522 --> 20:58.324
that already has
all the distribution

20:58.324 --> 21:01.761
and manufacturing facilities
and license it to them?

21:01.761 --> 21:04.730
Why are you trying
to reinvent the wheel,

21:04.730 --> 21:06.899
and I really mean
reinvent the wheel,

21:06.899 --> 21:09.068
by starting
manufacturing facilities?

21:09.068 --> 21:11.470
I mean, I can't even
comprehend how expensive

21:11.470 --> 21:12.838
and how long
that would take.

as a car enthusiast, right,

21:24.683 --> 21:27.219
you were talking about
going into the world of cars.

21:27.219 --> 21:29.588
I got interested for a second
because I wanted to know,

21:29.588 --> 21:31.957
oh, man, maybe there's
a dope connection here.
There is.

21:31.957 --> 21:33.993
To his point,
while attaching yourself

21:33.993 --> 21:36.695
to a brand that exists,
that already has success,

21:36.695 --> 21:38.130
you're giving that brand
another tier,

21:38.130 --> 21:41.133
I just feel like
it's a smarter route.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.735
You didn't do a good job

21:42.735 --> 21:45.538
of presenting the business
within your business.

21:45.538 --> 21:48.207
You gave me some jargon
that I didn't understand.

21:48.207 --> 21:49.975
I was waiting for the pieces
to the puzzle

21:49.975 --> 21:51.277
that I could understand.

21:51.277 --> 21:53.579
And as an investor,
I don't ever want to not know.

21:53.579 --> 21:55.548
I didn't know
what was going on.

21:55.548 --> 21:58.150
It's way too early,
it's way too expensive,

21:58.150 --> 22:02.154
so I'm going to
have to say I'm out.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.355
The bottom line is,

22:03.355 --> 22:04.924

five different ways,

22:04.924 --> 22:07.860
it was very confusing,
and it's a shame.

Yeah, absolutely.

virtual meet and greet.

24:50.255 --> 24:53.425
Of that rate, they keep 75%.
We earn 25%.

24:53.425 --> 24:54.660
How it works
is you come to our website,

24:54.660 --> 24:56.528

Yes.

25:03.068 --> 25:04.803

sets their own rate,

25:04.803 --> 25:06.338
but obviously,

25:06.338 --> 25:08.307
What's the lowest

our service at least four times.

25:29.395 --> 25:31.030
Where are these fans
coming from?

25:31.030 --> 25:33.098
We don't do any traditional
forms of marketing.

25:33.098 --> 25:34.767
Right now, we get our customers
from our celebrities

25:34.767 --> 25:37.136
posting on their social media
and through outreach.

25:37.136 --> 25:38.270
So you're using
the platform

25:38.270 --> 25:40.105
of the celebrities
that you guys have

25:40.105 --> 25:43.042
in hopes that you'll get
a return in engagement

25:43.042 --> 25:44.443
from their fans
to come over to Candi?

25:44.443 --> 25:45.544
‐Absolutely.
‐As of now, yes.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.279
So Candi doesn't necessarily
have an engine

25:47.279 --> 25:50.049
that they've built that you guys
are using to distribute from?

25:50.049 --> 25:52.551
Well, we would say the engine is
the celebrities, right ‐‐

25:52.551 --> 25:55.354
That you posting, obviously,
to your fan base.

25:55.354 --> 25:57.623
You'd be a billionaire
if he posted once.

25:57.623 --> 25:59.725
Yeah, exactly, right?
That's the idea.

25:59.725 --> 26:00.993
So tell us about you.

26:00.993 --> 26:02.561
We were really like
a cliché couple.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.329
I was the captain
of a cheerleading team.

26:04.329 --> 26:06.165
He was the captain
of the football team.

26:06.165 --> 26:07.666
Following high school,

26:07.666 --> 26:10.169
I attended
the University of Illinois,

26:10.169 --> 26:13.672
where I graduated
within three years with honors.
Wow.

26:13.672 --> 26:16.742
And we actually had
our first son, Scotty,

26:16.742 --> 26:18.310
my last year
of undergrad,

26:18.310 --> 26:20.312
so that was definitely
difficult.

26:20.312 --> 26:23.482
When we launched Candi
of April of 2020,

26:23.482 --> 26:26.018
I was four months' pregnant
with our second son, Chase.

26:26.018 --> 26:28.420
His birthday is today.
[ Laughs ]

26:28.420 --> 26:30.656
And up until labor
and delivery,

26:30.656 --> 26:32.124
I was still working,

26:32.124 --> 26:34.526
and the next day
after I delivered Chase...
Of course.

26:34.526 --> 26:35.828
...I had to work
a meet and greet,

26:35.828 --> 26:38.597
and I had my baby on my boob
and my laptop on my knees,

26:38.597 --> 26:40.132
so I've been grinding
ever since.

26:40.132 --> 26:43.068
We like to say we don't really
have maternity policy at Candi.

26:43.068 --> 26:44.503
What's your background?

26:44.503 --> 26:47.206
So, unfortunately, I was born to
a mother who abandoned me

26:47.206 --> 26:50.175
and my two younger brothers
when I was just 4 years old.

26:50.175 --> 26:52.744
Fast forward a little bit,
I get to college,

26:52.744 --> 26:54.847
I had an opportunity to play
Division I college football

26:54.847 --> 26:56.548
at Eastern
Illinois University.

26:56.548 --> 26:58.117
I'm having the best time
in my life,

26:58.117 --> 27:00.619
but I was unhappy because I knew
what my younger brothers

27:00.619 --> 27:02.254
were facing
on a day to day basis.

27:02.254 --> 27:04.356
And so after my freshman year,
I was 19 years old.

27:04.356 --> 27:07.392
I went back and I adopted
my 14‐ and 15‐year‐old brothers,

27:07.392 --> 27:08.327
legally becoming
their father.

27:08.327 --> 27:09.128
‐That's so nice.
‐Mm!

27:09.128 --> 27:10.295
So I was a full‐time

27:10.295 --> 27:11.830
Division I
college athlete.

27:11.830 --> 27:13.699
I was a single father
of two teenage boys,

27:13.699 --> 27:15.834
and I also graduated undergrad
in three years,

27:15.834 --> 27:17.402
with my bachelor's
of applied engineering.

27:17.402 --> 27:19.538
So in our house, if you
graduate with a bachelor's

27:19.538 --> 27:21.440
in more than three years,
you're probably slouching.

27:21.440 --> 27:23.175
[ Laughter ]

27:23.175 --> 27:25.077
Then I had the opportunity
to go to law school

27:25.077 --> 27:26.445
at the University of Illinois
College of Law.

27:26.445 --> 27:28.747
I graduated in three years
with honors.
Yeah!

27:28.747 --> 27:32.217
And for the past six years,
I've been practicing mergers,
acquisitions, representing

27:32.217 --> 27:33.652
some of the biggest numbers
in the world.
Fabulous.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.220
How did you
think of the idea?

27:35.220 --> 27:36.255
Yeah, absolutely.

27:36.255 --> 27:37.523
We saw
some reaction videos

27:37.523 --> 27:39.458
from some competitors
in the industry,

27:39.458 --> 27:41.326
and we saw how excited
fans were,

27:41.326 --> 27:42.861
and happy
and crying and elated.

27:42.861 --> 27:44.763
And we said,
how amazing would it be,

27:44.763 --> 27:46.198
instead of someone
giving you the phone

27:46.198 --> 27:47.499
and saying,
"Press play,"

27:47.499 --> 27:48.967
they gave you the phone
and Barbara was actually there

27:48.967 --> 27:50.502
to have a conversation
with you?

27:50.502 --> 27:52.671
How much more personal
that experience would be.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.506
The first thing to understand
is this ‐‐

27:54.506 --> 27:56.508
We have no experience
in Hollywood,

27:56.508 --> 27:58.076
no connections.

27:58.076 --> 28:00.979
I'm not a manager, she's not
an agent, no connection.
Good for you.

28:00.979 --> 28:02.948
We were everyday people
sitting on our couch.

28:02.948 --> 28:07.853
In the first week from us
having an idea of really trying
to push Candi to being live,

28:07.853 --> 28:10.889
we got 26 influencers
and celebrities in one week.

28:10.889 --> 28:12.157
How we do that is hustle.

28:12.157 --> 28:14.226
You guys are asking
for $500,000.

28:14.226 --> 28:15.160
What are you gonna do
with the money?

28:15.160 --> 28:16.762
So, we want to do
three things.

28:16.762 --> 28:19.665
Most importantly, we want to
have better technology.

28:19.665 --> 28:21.433
Yes, we do want an app.

28:21.433 --> 28:22.901
And two,
we want to hire more team

28:22.901 --> 28:24.570
for our talent acquisition

28:24.570 --> 28:27.139
so we can hone in
on more quality talent.

28:27.139 --> 28:29.374
And lastly, we want to increase
our marketing efforts.

28:29.374 --> 28:31.710
So, you really need an app,
because it's very hard

28:31.710 --> 28:35.480
to get people and acquire
customers and fans...
Yes.

28:35.480 --> 28:36.648
...I mean,
just out on the web.

28:36.648 --> 28:38.517
Hart: I think
what's even harder is,

28:38.517 --> 28:40.452
you know,
the talent pool, right?

28:40.452 --> 28:42.921
The talent pool is going
to guarantee you a return,

28:42.921 --> 28:44.389
which is where
I'm having trouble,

28:44.389 --> 28:47.392
because, you know, these things
have existed before.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.895
And the reason why they come
far, few, and in between

28:49.895 --> 28:52.698
in a place of success
is because they fall apart

28:52.698 --> 28:56.969
based on not being able to stay
true to what the commitment was.

28:56.969 --> 28:59.338
And I just don't know
if there's a world

28:59.338 --> 29:01.740
where you can guarantee
that type of talent.

29:01.740 --> 29:04.009
Cuban: Yeah, no one's saying
it's a bad business for them.
It's not.

29:04.009 --> 29:06.478
Right? Look,
if you're doing $100,000

29:06.478 --> 29:08.880
and you're netting $25,000,
right,

29:08.880 --> 29:10.415
and you're working from home,

29:10.415 --> 29:12.684
that's not a bad business,
but that's a different question

29:12.684 --> 29:15.020
than whether or not
it's an investable business.
That's the big side.

29:15.020 --> 29:17.889
And if I can interject,
I think it is, right?

29:17.889 --> 29:19.424
I heard you say before,
Mr. Wonderful,

29:19.424 --> 29:20.792
you're looking for
a great business model

29:20.792 --> 29:22.427
that you can
pour gasoline on.
Right.

29:22.427 --> 29:24.296
If you look at what we've been
able to do with no experience

29:24.296 --> 29:26.732
in the industry,
no relationships, with no ties,

29:26.732 --> 29:27.966
you pour a little gasoline
on that,

29:27.966 --> 29:29.101
you're going to
have a huge fire.

29:29.101 --> 29:31.169
Yeah, but you asked for
a lot of gasoline.

29:31.169 --> 29:34.239
Honestly, I‐I love the attempt,
and I love the effort.

29:34.239 --> 29:39.278
I just think it's too early to
attach myself or get involved,

29:39.278 --> 29:40.846
even from an investment
perspective,

29:40.846 --> 29:43.048
because we don't really know

29:43.048 --> 29:44.750
if this is something
that not only works,

29:44.750 --> 29:47.519
but who's to say that
somebody won't swoop in

29:47.519 --> 29:49.821
and do the bigger
version of Candi, right?

29:49.821 --> 29:51.790
Well, guess what, Kevin?
That can be us.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.725
We just need
your validation, right?

29:53.725 --> 29:55.494
We need the fact that
Kevin Hart has said

29:55.494 --> 29:58.263
he puts his name
and his stamp on that.
Life's not that way.

29:58.263 --> 30:01.933
You don't get some golden bullet
that just builds a business.
Fair.

30:01.933 --> 30:03.835
It just doesn't happen
that way.

30:03.835 --> 30:05.237
That was a big problem,
when you said,

30:05.237 --> 30:08.440
"Well, you know, we're going
to use our celebrities,

30:08.440 --> 30:10.175
and then from them,
in hopes

30:10.175 --> 30:12.878
get people to come on
and X, Y, and Z."

30:12.878 --> 30:14.313
It's a trickle effect.

to start with,

10,000 people,

30:24.856 --> 30:26.925

grow some awareness in Candi.

33:44.623 --> 33:46.725
is to make it
into an animated series.

33:46.725 --> 33:49.361
We are here to give Black
and brown creators

33:49.361 --> 33:53.198
a place to tell their stories
and shine a spotlight

33:53.198 --> 33:55.467

33:55.467 --> 33:56.668

All: Who is ready
to join the Black Sands family?

33:59.070 --> 34:00.972
Ooh! Okay.

34:00.972 --> 34:02.574
Please sit back, relax.

34:02.574 --> 34:03.909
We're going to give you
a little taste of the future

34:03.909 --> 34:06.344
of Black Sands Entertainment.

34:06.344 --> 34:08.380
Man:
How long has he trained you?

34:08.380 --> 34:10.248
Man #2:
I did not train him.

34:10.248 --> 34:13.785
I took him into the wilderness
for five years.

34:13.785 --> 34:17.155
He has survived.

34:17.155 --> 34:18.657
I forbid this battle!

34:18.657 --> 34:21.493
You will stop nothing.
Damn it, brother!

34:21.493 --> 34:25.597
Why must you be like this
all the time?

34:25.597 --> 34:28.300
Man #3: Ausar,
you need to think this through.

34:28.300 --> 34:32.037
Ausar: There is nothing
to think about.

34:34.673 --> 34:36.741

You can read it and watch it.

34:36.741 --> 34:38.143
Now let's go.

34:38.143 --> 34:39.711
All right. Well, you know what?
I'm gonna start here.

34:39.711 --> 34:41.680
And not just because I'm Black,

34:41.680 --> 34:44.983
but because I understand
the value behind IP,

34:44.983 --> 34:47.185
the want and
need for it.

34:47.185 --> 34:49.120
What's the cost that you put
into this so far?

34:49.120 --> 34:52.490
So our animated property,
which is an eight‐minute pilot,

34:52.490 --> 34:54.326
is $250,000.

34:54.326 --> 34:55.860
And Teunis is
the expert in that.

34:55.860 --> 34:57.062
He is our head of studio.

34:57.062 --> 34:59.831
Is this all self‐engineered,
self‐developed?

34:59.831 --> 35:01.132
Yeah, like,
I've been in the business

35:01.132 --> 35:02.500
like 25‐plus years.
Wow.

35:02.500 --> 35:05.437
I've been with Disney, Pixar,
like major studios,

35:05.437 --> 35:09.007
and I left all that
to join Black Sands

35:09.007 --> 35:10.675
because it's something
I really believe in.
Mm‐hmm.

35:10.675 --> 35:12.877
And what I saw
was like a real winner.

35:12.877 --> 35:14.446
How are you creating
a revenue stream?

35:14.446 --> 35:16.581
Most of our revenue stream
is physical books.

35:16.581 --> 35:18.049
That's what we do.

35:18.049 --> 35:20.885
Currently, we're on pace to do
about 120,000 units this year.

35:20.885 --> 35:22.621
‐Direct to consumer?
‐Direct to consumer.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.389
And what do you
sell them for?

35:24.389 --> 35:26.091
So we sell that one for ‐‐

35:26.091 --> 35:28.493
It costs $2 at landing,

35:28.493 --> 35:32.130
$20 retail, and $8 wholesale.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.298
Good for you.

35:33.298 --> 35:35.500
$20 retail?
Is that a typical retail price?

35:35.500 --> 35:37.268
That is the typical
retail price.

35:37.268 --> 35:39.037
You mentioned
comic books as well.

35:39.037 --> 35:40.238
Manuel:
We have a lot of comic books.

35:40.238 --> 35:41.840
We have 12 titles
that are currently signed

35:41.840 --> 35:43.074
to Black Sands.

35:43.074 --> 35:44.709
The one that
you currently have in your hand

35:44.709 --> 35:45.777
is our flagship title,

35:45.777 --> 35:47.479
which makes the bulk
of our money.

35:47.479 --> 35:50.048
So from comic book one to now,

35:50.048 --> 35:51.850
what has been the progression
of sales that have gotten

35:51.850 --> 35:53.985
you guys to that number
of 120,000?

35:53.985 --> 35:57.389
In our first year, we did about
$40,000 in sales.

35:57.389 --> 35:58.790
We just started in 2017.

35:58.790 --> 36:02.694
In 2018, we did about
$220,000 in sales.

36:02.694 --> 36:05.964
2018,
we raised capital for a DVD.

36:05.964 --> 36:07.165
We built that.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.634
In 2020,
we had $600,000 in sales.

36:09.634 --> 36:11.903
This year, we're at $800,000
in sales.

36:11.903 --> 36:14.105
‐Year to date?
‐Yeah, year to date.

36:14.105 --> 36:16.441
Manuel and Geiszel,
what's your backgrounds?

36:16.441 --> 36:20.045
So I'm a military veteran.
I served in the Army.
Thank you for your service.

36:20.045 --> 36:21.479
Thank you so much.

36:21.479 --> 36:23.181
And we took
that military background,

36:23.181 --> 36:25.183
me and my husband ‐‐
So you're married.

36:25.183 --> 36:28.253
Yes, we are.
Did you know
anything about animation?

36:28.253 --> 36:30.689
Anything about comic books?
We didn't know anything.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.791
But with the military
background,

36:32.791 --> 36:36.361
we knew how to execute
and manage a business.

36:36.361 --> 36:39.497
And who created the stories?
Manuel.

36:39.497 --> 36:41.066
I'm a big entertainment guy.

36:41.066 --> 36:43.968
I constantly see
the same Egyptian story flop

36:43.968 --> 36:45.670
over and over again
in the industry,

36:45.670 --> 36:48.373
very detached
from the historical setting.

36:48.373 --> 36:50.775
And so I said, I'm going to make
my own story about Egypt.

36:50.775 --> 36:53.044
I'm going to put everybody
in the Middle East into it.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.747
So we got Spartans, Minoans,
Canaanites.

36:55.747 --> 36:58.349
You got the whole Bible
right there.

36:58.349 --> 36:59.784
We got the whole Middle East
involved.

36:59.784 --> 37:01.920
Educators,
they love this stuff.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.388
So the next big question is

37:03.388 --> 37:05.090
your profitability
and cash burn.

37:05.090 --> 37:07.392
This year, we're $108,000
in the green.

37:07.392 --> 37:09.260
How much cash
do you have in the bank?

37:09.260 --> 37:10.729
$300,000.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.464
To Kevin's point
on leveraging IP,

37:12.464 --> 37:14.866
where do you see
the series going, right?

37:14.866 --> 37:16.801
You've got to have a place
you like to see it,

37:16.801 --> 37:19.437
because it's not a traditional
television type thing.
Absolutely.

37:19.437 --> 37:22.640
So we are eventually going
to find a distributor, right?

37:22.640 --> 37:23.975
Hart:
Let me stop you right here.

37:23.975 --> 37:27.245
I act as a one stop shop.
I'm a distributor.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.080
I'm a production hub.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.782
$500,000 is a lot.

37:30.782 --> 37:32.283
What are you using
the money for?

37:32.283 --> 37:34.652
So the money that we're going to
get, you know,

37:34.652 --> 37:36.187
when we get this deal, right,

37:36.187 --> 37:38.123
is to expand the production
of Black Sands.
Just like that.

37:38.123 --> 37:39.524
You're gonna get that deal.

37:39.524 --> 37:42.894
Manuel's got confidence.
I love that. I like it.
I love that.

37:42.894 --> 37:44.662
We do eight issues a year.

37:44.662 --> 37:45.964
We will massively expand it.

37:45.964 --> 37:47.599
We'll probably get to
30 different issues a year,

37:47.599 --> 37:51.436
including pumping out at least
a full season of the main title,

37:51.436 --> 37:53.872
and all these ridiculously
lovable characters

37:53.872 --> 37:55.306
in the series,
they get their own series.

37:55.306 --> 37:57.308
See, but when I ask you
that question,

37:57.308 --> 38:00.044
I'm expecting a clear answer.

38:00.044 --> 38:02.013
Tell me where
you're spending the money.

38:02.013 --> 38:03.448
That's what I need to know.

38:03.448 --> 38:05.283
Hiring artists to basically
build this pipeline.

38:05.283 --> 38:06.818
We need writers, too,
and everything else.

38:06.818 --> 38:08.987
These artists are like
$30,000, $40,000 each,

38:08.987 --> 38:10.321
every single year.

38:10.321 --> 38:11.356
All right, guys.

38:11.356 --> 38:12.524
I do understand
what you're doing

38:12.524 --> 38:13.825
and I understand the world.

38:13.825 --> 38:15.894
The 5% is ‐‐
that's ridiculous.

38:15.894 --> 38:17.595
I'm going to throw that out
the window. That can't happen.

38:17.595 --> 38:19.764
I mean, you're asking
for an investment

38:19.764 --> 38:23.067
and you're asking for
the added value

38:23.067 --> 38:24.202
in you creating IP.

38:24.202 --> 38:25.670
So I'm just going
to tell you the value

38:25.670 --> 38:29.107
I feel like I'm bringing to you
before I give you my offer.

38:29.107 --> 38:32.744
Okay? I own distribution
in the world of audio.

38:32.744 --> 38:35.480
I own distribution
in the world of television.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.048
Because of my ecosystem

38:37.048 --> 38:39.951
and what I know
we can bring to the table,

38:39.951 --> 38:42.187
I see the significant value
in just a brand.

38:42.187 --> 38:43.721
And if you have a brand
and you're already

38:43.721 --> 38:46.591
moving product in that brand,
that's of value to me

38:46.591 --> 38:49.227
because if you do strike gold
in this space

38:49.227 --> 38:51.963
and you get to
the world of toys, et cetera,

38:51.963 --> 38:53.198
well, this can be ‐‐

38:53.198 --> 38:54.432
this can be
a [bleep] moneymaker.

38:54.432 --> 38:57.101
Oh, I just cursed.
I'm sorry.
Whoa, big guy!

38:57.101 --> 38:58.203
This can be a moneymaker.

38:58.203 --> 39:00.738
So I am going to put
an offer on the table.

39:00.738 --> 39:02.373
Wait, can I get in?
Of course you can.

39:02.373 --> 39:04.642
You tell me if you like
where I'm at, okay?
Okay.

39:04.642 --> 39:08.847
You're asking for $500,000
and you're saying,

39:08.847 --> 39:10.582
we want it
because we want to bring in

39:10.582 --> 39:12.317
the other people
to help create.

39:12.317 --> 39:14.652
Well, I already have that.
We already have those people.

39:14.652 --> 39:16.621
So you're not paying
for that necessarily

39:16.621 --> 39:18.623
because you'll be
accessing mine.

39:18.623 --> 39:21.025
Kev, I'll help

Okay.

I'll help on the online
distribution side of it.
Okay.

the whole pathway.

Yes.
