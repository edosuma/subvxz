[footsteps]

03:50.680 --> 03:52.200
What have you found?

03:53.520 --> 03:54.520
The dead.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.240
What have you found?

03:57.120 --> 03:58.120
The living.

03:59.200 --> 04:01.120
The Old Warrior sent me back for you.

04:01.520 --> 04:04.520
He has wandered far
and wishes your presence at once.

04:05.840 --> 04:07.880
As he wishes, so shall it be.

04:09.400 --> 04:10.480
[whoosh]

04:10.560 --> 04:11.560
[lands]

04:12.000 --> 04:13.720
Why have you come here, Iocarus?

04:14.240 --> 04:17.400
Why do you
walk this mausoleum of our ancestors?

04:18.920 --> 04:22.680
To remember who we once were
and to gather the souls of our dead.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.560
[footsteps]

04:24.720 --> 04:26.640
That is why the elders sent us back here.

04:27.360 --> 04:29.320
I asked why you have returned.

04:29.880 --> 04:30.960
What do you seek?

04:31.120 --> 04:36.480

[atmospheric music]

05:07.720 --> 05:08.720
[clink]

05:09.080 --> 05:10.080
How many now?

05:10.720 --> 05:14.800
Saving even one soul would make
this journey worthwhile, Drasalia.

05:15.360 --> 05:17.080
Indeed. How many?

05:18.280 --> 05:19.280
Two.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.240
[footsteps]

05:21.400 --> 05:22.960
Do you take no comfort here?

05:23.320 --> 05:24.320
None at all?

05:24.400 --> 05:26.800
I see a dead forest burned long ago.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.120
I see a lifeless
craftworld cold in the void.

05:30.720 --> 05:32.360
What comfort should I take?

05:33.360 --> 05:34.720
This was our home.

05:36.040 --> 05:37.640
[Drasalia] It was never my home.

05:38.120 --> 05:41.080
This place was a tomb a
before I drew my first breath.

05:43.480 --> 05:50.320
[atmospheric music]

05:50.400 --> 05:57.200
[atmospheric music]

05:57.280 --> 06:03.120
[forbidding music]

06:03.280 --> 06:04.400
[Drasalia] Iocarus.

06:05.120 --> 06:07.680
[Drasalia] Iocarus. Iocarus!

06:07.880 --> 06:08.920
[gasps]

06:11.720 --> 06:13.760
[footsteps]

06:13.920 --> 06:15.520
I would come here as a child.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.040
It was a garden of muses

06:18.400 --> 06:20.400
where songweavers and bonesingers

06:20.480 --> 06:22.960
would shape great works
for grateful patrons.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.920
You are beginning to sound
like the Old Warrior.

06:26.280 --> 06:27.760
Lost in the past

06:28.080 --> 06:30.640
armouring yourself in ancient memories.

06:31.920 --> 06:34.280
You should cherish
the Old Warrior's tales.

06:34.360 --> 06:35.440
I cherish them.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.560
I merely refuse to worship them.

06:37.720 --> 06:39.960
[footsteps]

07:25.640 --> 07:26.760
[footsteps halt]

07:29.640 --> 07:32.240
Warlock. Outcast.

07:32.560 --> 07:33.560
[head turns]

07:34.640 --> 07:36.960
Exarch Omo'Dai. You summoned me?

07:38.200 --> 07:40.160
You stand where many fell.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.680
My masters and my disciples
on the way of the warrior.

07:45.240 --> 07:46.960
This was our shrine.

07:48.080 --> 07:49.800
Is there anything
you wish to take with us?

07:50.640 --> 07:54.600
[Omo'Dai] What the foe did not desecrate
has since been eroded by time.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
No.

07:56.200 --> 07:59.840
We are not here to sift through the bones
of my brothers and sisters.

08:00.640 --> 08:01.840
But there is something here.

08:03.800 --> 08:04.800
Come.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.280
[footsteps]
Where are you leading us, Exarch?

08:08.120 --> 08:10.360
Towards that
which has slept for a lifetime

08:11.240 --> 08:12.640
waiting to be discovered.

08:13.240 --> 08:14.240
[Drasalia] A relic?

08:14.480 --> 08:15.840
[Drasalia] A spirit stone?

08:16.480 --> 08:18.000
More precious than either

08:18.600 --> 08:20.520
yet rarer than neither.

08:20.680 --> 08:25.440
[footsteps]

08:26.360 --> 08:27.600
[Iocarus] I do not understand.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.800
There is a way
to see and find what you seek.

08:32.160 --> 08:33.240
[armour clanks]

08:33.400 --> 08:38.400
[atmospheric music]

08:38.480 --> 08:43.800
[atmospheric music]

08:43.960 --> 08:45.640
[Drasalia and Iocarus gasp]

08:46.800 --> 08:49.480
[Omo'Dai] The last of my shrine warriors
were driven back here.

08:50.320 --> 08:52.480
Fighting in the shadow of our wounded god.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.760
You saw the avatar die?

08:57.360 --> 09:00.080
[Omo'Dai] Yes... and yet no.

09:00.880 --> 09:04.360
The god-shard was already
dying from the days of ceaseless battle.

09:04.880 --> 09:09.000
By the time it reached us
it was shattered, bleeding

09:10.120 --> 09:13.360
animated by nothing but divine rage.

09:15.120 --> 09:16.760
But I saw its final moments.

09:17.280 --> 09:19.960
I witnessed the incarnation of Khaine die.

09:20.120 --> 09:21.120
[footsteps]

09:21.280 --> 09:24.760
The question, Warlock,
is whether you desire to do the same?

09:25.400 --> 09:27.760
[Iocarus] A soul echo of such a moment

09:28.240 --> 09:30.640
like the fall of lightning
at a storm's height.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.720
Why? To what purpose?

09:35.160 --> 09:38.160
What can be learned by such a vision
that we do not already know?

09:38.800 --> 09:41.440
Our duty is to seek the wisdom of history

09:41.680 --> 09:46.640
to forge our people's future,
not to wallow in the horrors of the past.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.640
Have you found anything more
than echoes, Warlock?

09:51.280 --> 09:53.520
Do they not fade before
they can guide you?

09:54.600 --> 09:56.480
[Omo'Dai] I said to you before
that I did not know

09:56.560 --> 09:58.720
and could not tell you where it lies.

09:59.560 --> 10:03.280
But in this god's grave
the past waits in frozen agony.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.880
True and burning.

10:06.880 --> 10:07.880
Touch it

10:08.280 --> 10:09.800
and you will see what you seek.

10:11.040 --> 10:13.800
[Drasalia] What does he speak of?
What have you been looking for?

10:15.240 --> 10:16.960
[footsteps]

10:17.440 --> 10:21.840
[Drasalia] Would you so idly experience
the death throes of a living god, Iocarus?

10:23.560 --> 10:24.920
I must see.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.280
So be it.

10:29.800 --> 10:30.840

12:08.600 --> 12:10.920
Your warriors bleed. [rapid gunfire]

12:12.040 --> 12:14.480
Your people die this day.

12:15.960 --> 12:17.080
[air hiss]
Ugh!

12:17.840 --> 12:22.120
How proud you must be,
of your ability to inflict atrocity.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.040
For the Emperor!

12:25.760 --> 12:27.400
[running in armour]
Rargh!

[Dreadnought] We are the
light of Humanity. [whirring]

13:09.960 --> 13:12.560
We are the Emperor's chosen.

13:13.320 --> 13:17.200
We are the angels of His mercy.

13:55.720 --> 13:59.560
[rapid gunfire]

14:03.160 --> 14:05.760
[Striking Scorpion] The wind of blood
and fate blows against us, Exarch.

14:06.640 --> 14:09.200
On your word we stand and die.

14:10.120 --> 14:12.160
The Avatar dies so we might live.

14:12.640 --> 14:14.280
Signal the shrines to fall back.

14:14.760 --> 14:16.480

Ungh! [breathing heavily]

14:46.760 --> 14:49.960
[collapsing]

14:53.720 --> 14:58.960
Ugh! Urgh! Argggggh!

15:00.640 --> 15:02.400
[breathing heavily]

15:02.560 --> 15:05.240
Such hatred... Such loss...

15:06.480 --> 15:07.840
[Drasalia] It is over, cousin

15:08.200 --> 15:09.800
you are yourself once more.

15:10.560 --> 15:13.360
It sings in my blood, a fire like venom.

15:15.520 --> 15:18.080
We must fall back further,
there is yet time.

15:18.160 --> 15:20.760
We can still get those of
innocent blood to the ships.

15:22.440 --> 15:23.480
Iocarus.

15:23.920 --> 15:26.280
Still time. There is still time!

15:26.880 --> 15:28.600
Exarch, what do we do?

15:30.240 --> 15:31.520
We do nothing, child.

15:32.400 --> 15:35.680
Nothing? He walks
in the shadows of what was!

15:35.840 --> 15:38.640
Blind to what is.
How do we bring him back?

15:39.320 --> 15:41.720
We do not need to bring him back, Outcast.

15:42.520 --> 15:44.120
He made this choice.

15:44.920 --> 15:47.880
This is the very truth he wished to taste.

15:48.840 --> 15:49.920
[hands on shoulder]

15:50.280 --> 15:51.840
He is a Warlock, Drasalia.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.560
He walks the Path of the Seer.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.320
Let him see.

15:57.480 --> 15:59.560
[running footsteps]
