(serene music playing)

01:04.667 --> 01:06.567
-Morning.
-Morning, honey.

01:06.633 --> 01:09.467
I had the strangest
dream last night.

01:09.533 --> 01:11.400
I was at a baseball game.

01:11.467 --> 01:15.934
Charlie Brown was pitching,
Schroeder was behind the plate,

01:16.000 --> 01:18.400
and Lucy and Snoopy
were in the outfield,

01:18.467 --> 01:20.667
and they wouldn't let me play!

01:22.266 --> 01:24.767
When I woke up, I was crying.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.467
What does it all mean?

01:27.800 --> 01:29.133
Peanuts envy?

01:33.900 --> 01:37.433
-Good morning.
-You got home late last night.

01:37.500 --> 01:39.433
When I went to bed,
you weren't in.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.033
I was up with Mel Bushman,

01:41.100 --> 01:44.300
having a "where is this
relationship going" talk.

01:44.367 --> 01:46.000
And where is it going?

01:46.066 --> 01:49.533
Where it usually goes,
room 506 at the Quality Court.

01:51.900 --> 01:53.900
Oh, I hate him.

01:53.967 --> 01:56.433
God, if only
he didn't want to talk.

01:59.700 --> 02:04.667
After I got in, you got a call
from a Glen somebody.

02:04.734 --> 02:07.367
Glen O'Brien?
Did he leave a number?

02:07.433 --> 02:08.600
Who's Glen O'Brien?

02:08.667 --> 02:12.533
He's the married guy she shacked up
with four years ago.

02:12.600 --> 02:17.000
I'm not proud of what I did,
but it didn't seem bad then.

02:17.066 --> 02:19.200
He was trapped
in a bad marriage.

02:19.266 --> 02:21.300
There's no such thing.

02:21.367 --> 02:23.133
You can get divorced.

02:23.200 --> 02:24.600
In Sicily there was no divorce.

02:24.667 --> 02:27.734
To end a marriage,
you had to resort to <i>lupara.</i>

02:27.800 --> 02:29.400
Is that a legal loophole?

02:29.467 --> 02:31.667
It's a sawed-off shotgun.

02:33.133 --> 02:34.700
Blanche, did he leave a number?

02:34.767 --> 02:35.667
No.

02:35.734 --> 02:37.934
Dropping him was
the smartest thing you ever did.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.767
What if he calls again?

02:39.834 --> 02:43.000
-Don't talk to him.
-Four years is a long time.

02:43.066 --> 02:46.200
-Maybe he's divorced.
-Why else would he call?

02:46.266 --> 02:48.333
-Stay away from him.
-See him.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.800
Keep some self-respect.

02:49.867 --> 02:53.000
Self-respect is for losers
like Rose.

02:54.333 --> 02:58.333
Sure, you'd have some great times
and some fabulous sex,

02:58.400 --> 03:00.333
but is that worth your self-respect?

03:00.400 --> 03:01.834
Not now, loser.

03:05.266 --> 03:08.533
(mellow music playing)

03:10.433 --> 03:12.767
(telephone rings)

03:17.233 --> 03:19.934
Hello.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.900
Oh, look, I'm sorry,
I'm gonna have to interrupt.

03:22.967 --> 03:25.033
No, I'm sure this is
a very worthy cause

03:25.100 --> 03:27.400
but, no, to be perfectly frank,
at this moment,

03:27.467 --> 03:30.567
I couldn't give a flying fig
about whooping cranes.

03:32.467 --> 03:35.100
No, no,
I have to keep the line free.

03:35.166 --> 03:36.633
Fine, I'll send you a check.

03:36.700 --> 03:38.533
Hold it, let me grab a pencil.

03:38.600 --> 03:42.200
Ok, Whooping Cranes, yeah,

03:42.266 --> 03:46.467
box 1990, Newcastle, Louisiana.

03:46.533 --> 03:49.500
Got it. Glad I could help. Bye-bye.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.667
Dorothy,
Blanche is taking me to the mall.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.033
-Want to come?
-I don't think so.

03:56.100 --> 03:58.400
You're not teaching today.
It'll be fun.

03:58.467 --> 04:01.333
I'd rather sit and read.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.633
(telephone rings)

04:06.633 --> 04:08.533
Hello?

04:08.600 --> 04:09.400
Oh, hi!

04:09.467 --> 04:12.667
Yes, I heard you called.
What a pleasant surprise.

04:12.734 --> 04:16.900
I'm pretty sure I can make it.
Let me check my book.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.300
I seem to be clear.

04:28.166 --> 04:30.300
He must have asked her out
this century.

04:32.467 --> 04:34.467
Where?

04:34.533 --> 04:36.567
Fine. Fine, all right.

04:36.633 --> 04:38.000
Bye-bye.

04:38.066 --> 04:39.300
What did he say?

04:39.367 --> 04:42.000
He has something important
to talk about.

04:42.066 --> 04:44.500
Oh... that's my favorite lie!

04:46.033 --> 04:47.600
Dorothy, you'll be sorry.

04:47.667 --> 04:49.500
Ma, we liked each other.

04:49.567 --> 04:52.033
He's a funny, warm, giving man.

04:52.100 --> 04:54.300
He made me laugh.
I am seeing him.

04:54.367 --> 04:56.400
Go ahead, meet your adulterer.

04:56.467 --> 04:58.734
But remember,
you were brought up a lady.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.467
Keep both your feet on the floor.

05:03.333 --> 05:05.700
I'd better go change.
Blanche, what should I wear?

05:05.767 --> 05:07.767
If you're keeping both feet
on the floor,

05:07.834 --> 05:10.567
something you can pull off
over your head.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.333
I don't care what
that salesgirl said.

05:24.400 --> 05:27.533
I looked good in
that bathing suit.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.934
Sometimes I wish
I did live in Brazil.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.433
Excuse me, did one of
you ladies drop this?

05:37.500 --> 05:39.433
Is there
money in it?

05:39.500 --> 05:42.000
-Uh-huh.
-I dropped it.

05:43.467 --> 05:46.066
Sophia,
you did nothing of the kind!

05:46.133 --> 05:47.200
A lot of money here.

05:47.266 --> 05:49.934
That does look like
Sophia's wallet.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.867
It's a man's wallet.
Did you see who dropped it?

05:52.934 --> 05:54.033
Afraid not.

05:54.100 --> 05:56.433
There's over $2,000 in here.

05:56.934 --> 06:00.233
Whoever lost this must be frantic.
We should turn it in.

06:00.300 --> 06:02.500
You're giving that kind of money

06:02.567 --> 06:06.567
to a guy who makes 2 bucks
an hour watching umbrellas?

06:07.066 --> 06:08.400
That's a good point.

06:08.467 --> 06:10.266
Besides, there's no I.D. in here.

06:10.333 --> 06:12.533
Let's put a notice
in the newspaper.

06:12.600 --> 06:16.000
After a while, if nobody claims it,
we could...

06:16.066 --> 06:17.834
Split it.

06:17.900 --> 06:21.166
That's what I'd want people to do
if I lost my wallet.

06:22.367 --> 06:23.300
Sure.

06:23.367 --> 06:25.700
Meantime,
who keeps the money?

06:25.767 --> 06:27.500
I don't know you well enough
to trust you.

06:27.567 --> 06:29.934
And her I know,
so we got a problem.

06:31.333 --> 06:35.433
Maybe we're too close
to the problem.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.834
Maybe we should ask somebody
who doesn't have a stake in this.

06:37.900 --> 06:40.667
Maybe they could find a solution.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.233
It's worth a try.

06:45.133 --> 06:47.667
Well, how about
that nun over there?

06:47.734 --> 06:51.266
What if she guilt's us
into giving it to charity?

06:51.333 --> 06:54.000
That's the last thing
we want to do.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.934
On the other hand,
she is a shopping nun.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.433
She could be ok.

07:00.467 --> 07:02.467
-Excuse me. Sister.
-Yes?

07:02.533 --> 07:05.633
We found a wallet
with some money in it.

07:05.700 --> 07:08.200
Until the rightful
owner claims it,

07:08.266 --> 07:10.633
we need a safe place for it.

07:10.700 --> 07:12.033
In a bank?

07:12.100 --> 07:13.300
But whose bank?

07:13.367 --> 07:15.934
Open a joint account
in all your names.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.333
I don't know.
I don't know these people.

07:19.400 --> 07:22.533
You could put up equal amounts
of your own money

07:22.600 --> 07:25.266
to show mutual good faith
and open an account.

07:25.333 --> 07:28.433
If the money isn't claimed,
you can split it.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.967
If it is, at least you've
made some interest.

07:31.033 --> 07:34.300
Oh, that sounds
too complicated.

07:34.367 --> 07:35.633
I think it would work.

07:35.700 --> 07:38.333
I'd gladly put up $2,000
of my money

07:38.400 --> 07:41.400
if you'd put up $1,000 each.

07:41.467 --> 07:44.166
-Thanks for your help, sister.
-Go with God.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.767
Sophia, I just don't know.

07:47.834 --> 07:51.266
Oh, come on. Dorothy's bank
is right over there.

07:51.333 --> 07:52.934
I can use her account.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.767
He's putting up his money.

07:54.834 --> 07:57.166
We should be willing to do the same.

07:57.233 --> 07:59.600
I guess it seems fair. Ok.

07:59.667 --> 08:01.700
Well, great.
Let's go.

08:01.767 --> 08:02.667
Now, Sophia, remember.

08:02.734 --> 08:05.266
Found money is supposed to
be spent on something frivolous,

08:05.333 --> 08:07.767
something you'd never
buy for yourself.

08:07.834 --> 08:09.934
What are you going to get,
underwear?

08:17.100 --> 08:21.600
(soft music playing)

08:22.100 --> 08:23.467
(doorbell chimes)

08:26.734 --> 08:28.333
-Dorothy.
-Hi.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.500
You look very pretty.

08:29.567 --> 08:31.033
So do you.

08:31.100 --> 08:32.333
Come in.

08:34.000 --> 08:34.967
Mmm.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.467
Nice place.

08:38.533 --> 08:41.533
Well, I was left a little strapped
by the settlement.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.600
-Something to drink?
-Settlement.

08:43.667 --> 08:45.300
The divorce settlement.

08:45.367 --> 08:47.767
I got to keep
half my self-respect,

08:47.834 --> 08:50.567
and she got to keep
everything else.

08:50.633 --> 08:53.266
That's why I called.
I had to find out...

08:54.133 --> 08:56.967
-how you were doing.
-I'm fine. I'm doing just fine.

08:57.033 --> 08:59.767
Maybe I will have just a glass
of water.

09:01.333 --> 09:04.667
Gee, it seems so strange
not meeting you in a hotel room.

09:06.734 --> 09:09.133
I guess I shouldn't
steal the towels.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.467
Towels, yeah. I got to put
that on my shopping list.

09:13.533 --> 09:16.767
Right next to soap
and broad with job.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.967
I've missed you, Dorothy.

09:20.033 --> 09:21.667
Mmm.

09:21.734 --> 09:22.834
Good water.

09:24.700 --> 09:26.100
I'm having a little trouble

09:26.166 --> 09:28.834
getting used to the idea
that you're divorced.

09:28.900 --> 09:33.066
I remember you told me that no matter
how bad the marriage was,

09:33.133 --> 09:37.567
you felt you were too old
to leave it for an uncertain future.

09:37.633 --> 09:38.633
Kidding.

09:38.700 --> 09:42.000
Actually,
I didn't have any choice.

09:42.066 --> 09:43.433
She divorced me.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.533
What happened, she found
you with someone else?

09:45.600 --> 09:48.567
No, she found herself
with someone else.

09:48.633 --> 09:52.166
I don't blame her.
Nothing was left between us.

09:52.233 --> 09:54.567
Listen.
Since things are different now,

09:54.633 --> 09:57.166
you think there's any chance
we could start over?

09:57.233 --> 10:01.667
Well... I don't know. I mean...
you know, four years...

10:01.734 --> 10:05.133
-Is there someone else?
-No!

10:05.200 --> 10:06.667
No, there's
no one else.

10:06.734 --> 10:07.967
Good.

10:11.433 --> 10:12.934
You know what's interesting?

10:13.000 --> 10:17.700
I just read somewhere that
the cells in the human body,

10:17.767 --> 10:21.934
completely regenerate themselves
every seven years.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.233
Isn't that interesting?

10:23.300 --> 10:25.433
Uh-huh.

10:25.500 --> 10:31.633
I guess that means we're 40%
of who we were four years ago.

10:31.700 --> 10:33.300
-Dorothy...
-Yes?

10:40.800 --> 10:43.200
Actually, it's 4 1/2 years,

10:43.266 --> 10:47.967
so that makes it closer to 35%.

10:48.033 --> 10:51.567
You know what? The last thing
my mother said to me

10:51.633 --> 10:55.033
was she wanted me to keep
my feet on the floor.

10:55.100 --> 10:58.467
My mother wanted me
to be a priest.

10:58.533 --> 11:02.066
I guess it's a bad day for mothers.

11:06.066 --> 11:10.400
(serene music playing)

11:11.633 --> 11:12.433
Rose.

11:12.500 --> 11:14.300
Hi. How was shopping?

11:14.367 --> 11:18.333
Great! Great! It was great!

11:18.400 --> 11:20.166
Really great.
Best shopping ever.

11:21.800 --> 11:23.433
I'll make some lemonade.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.400
I bet you girls
could really use some.

11:25.467 --> 11:26.600
-Great!
-Great!

11:28.467 --> 11:30.066
Okey-dokey.

11:30.133 --> 11:33.600
Now, Sophia, remember.
We swore we don't tell anybody.

11:33.667 --> 11:35.967
Not even Dorothy?
I owe it to her. It was her money.

11:36.033 --> 11:40.100
Nobody. I just couldn't
stand the humiliation.

11:40.166 --> 11:44.333
You want the world to know a perfect
stranger tricked us out of $2,000?

11:44.400 --> 11:47.333
Ok, I won't tell anybody.

11:47.400 --> 11:50.700
Don't worry about me.
Not a word to anyone.

11:50.767 --> 11:53.800
I swear on
my uncle Guido's grave.

11:53.867 --> 11:55.600
Then the guy gave us the envelope

11:55.667 --> 11:59.567
with his money, our money,
and the found money.

11:59.633 --> 12:03.400
When the teller opened the envelope,

12:03.467 --> 12:05.000
there were just scraps of paper
in it.

12:05.066 --> 12:06.734
I don't remember any more.

12:06.800 --> 12:09.400
That's all you'll get from me no
matter how many times you hit me.

12:14.333 --> 12:17.367
Sophia!
What about your uncle Guido?

12:17.433 --> 12:20.600
He's fine. I got a postcard
from him this morning.

12:22.200 --> 12:25.633
You were victims of the oldest
confidence game going,

12:25.700 --> 12:26.734
the pigeon drop.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.066
But he just seemed so honest.

12:29.133 --> 12:31.967
That's why it's called
a confidence game.

12:32.033 --> 12:34.934
He has to win your confidence
or you wouldn't put up the money.

12:34.967 --> 12:38.834
It wasn't his idea.
The nun suggested it.

12:39.333 --> 12:42.900
She was part of the team.
They always work in pairs.

12:42.967 --> 12:45.300
I don't know
what the church is coming to.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.667
I thought it stopped with bingo.

12:50.533 --> 12:52.667
That was no nun.

12:52.734 --> 12:55.600
I worked consumer-protection show.

12:55.667 --> 12:58.467
We've been warning people
about this for months.

12:58.533 --> 13:00.734
Once these scamsters have
your money in an envelope,

13:00.800 --> 13:04.600
they make a switch and you wind
up with worthless paper.

13:04.667 --> 13:07.433
They prey on the old
and the gullible.

13:13.467 --> 13:16.000
Are you calling me gullible?

13:16.500 --> 13:17.667
No.

13:18.567 --> 13:19.900
Oh.

13:22.567 --> 13:25.200
There's one thing
you should do right away.

13:25.266 --> 13:26.600
Inform the police.

13:26.667 --> 13:28.066
Oh, forget it!

13:28.133 --> 13:30.800
The reason these confidence
men don't get caught is

13:30.867 --> 13:33.100
because people are embarrassed
to come forward

13:33.166 --> 13:34.767
and admit they were conned.

13:34.834 --> 13:37.266
I'm sorry, Rose, I just can't.

13:37.333 --> 13:39.266
Well, perhaps this little story

13:39.333 --> 13:41.333
might make you
change your mind.

13:42.900 --> 13:44.367
Back in St. Olaf...

13:47.433 --> 13:51.667
a shepherd boy tended his flock
on the hill above the town.

13:51.734 --> 13:54.600
A wolf kept coming
and stealing his sheep,

13:54.667 --> 13:56.734
but the boy never
caught him doing it.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.300
Because he never
saw it happening,

13:58.367 --> 14:02.500
he became known around St. Olaf
as the boy who didn't cry wolf.

14:07.300 --> 14:10.700
Anyway, one day the townspeople
heard the boy on the hill

14:10.767 --> 14:12.834
yelling, "Wolf! Wolf!"

14:12.900 --> 14:16.166
They all figured if the boy
never cried wolf

14:16.233 --> 14:20.066
when the wolf was there,
if he yelled wolf now,

14:20.133 --> 14:22.967
it stood to reason
the wolf wasn't there.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.700
Boy, nothing gets
by you people.

14:30.934 --> 14:33.667
Damn straight. It was a bear!

14:36.300 --> 14:38.934
A huge, ferocious grizzly bear.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.333
What happened to the boy?

14:40.400 --> 14:44.266
He became known as the boy
who cried continuously.

14:46.600 --> 14:51.500
(mellow music playing)

14:51.567 --> 14:54.967
I just talked to Sergeant Delfino
of the Bunco squad.

14:55.033 --> 14:58.567
They caught two people matching
the descriptions we gave.

14:58.633 --> 15:01.834
They want us to come down tomorrow
and pick out nuns from a lineup.

15:03.533 --> 15:05.500
That must make you feel proud.

15:05.567 --> 15:07.433
That's what Sergeant Delfino said,

15:07.500 --> 15:08.934
"You must feel proud

15:09.000 --> 15:11.133
knowing that having
come forth as you have,

15:11.200 --> 15:15.166
you've possibly saved other
oldsters from a similar rip-off."

15:15.233 --> 15:16.834
He called me an oldster.

15:18.734 --> 15:20.100
I called him a pig.

15:23.100 --> 15:25.000
We're having dinner on Saturday.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.100
I really appreciate this,
your meeting my mother.

15:32.166 --> 15:34.433
Hey.
You want to get married?

15:34.500 --> 15:36.900
You mean instead of
meeting my mother?

15:36.967 --> 15:38.700
No. We can do both.

15:39.200 --> 15:41.667
That's kind of sudden.

15:41.734 --> 15:42.900
Well, think about it.

15:42.967 --> 15:47.333
I will. I mean... this is something
to think about.

15:47.834 --> 15:49.033
Ok, let's go.

15:49.100 --> 15:51.266
Oh, God.
This is going to be awful.

15:51.333 --> 15:52.633
I'm looking forward to this.

15:52.700 --> 15:54.734
Meeting the mother
gives you a good idea

15:54.800 --> 15:57.500
what the daughter will look like
in 30 years.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.767
Only if you lock me
in the dryer.

16:10.467 --> 16:13.066
Everybody, this is Glen.

16:13.133 --> 16:15.333
-Glen, I'd like you--
-No, don't tell me.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.433
Rose. Blanche.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.834
And Mrs. Petrillo,
these are for you.

16:21.900 --> 16:25.567
Cannoli? What does an Irishman
know about cannoli?

16:25.633 --> 16:27.066
When I was a kid in Brooklyn,

16:27.133 --> 16:31.200
every Sunday my father went
to Zampano's bakery for cannoli.

16:31.266 --> 16:33.533
I never dreamed you grew up
in Brooklyn.

16:33.600 --> 16:36.967
Sure. Our block was Irish,
the other block was Italian.

16:37.033 --> 16:40.333
We took turns beating each other up
on the way home from school.

16:41.567 --> 16:43.967
I think it's nice
when kids take turns.

16:45.900 --> 16:46.767
Yeah.

16:46.834 --> 16:48.934
Blanche, honey, could I see you
in the kitchen for a minute?

16:49.000 --> 16:50.300
Oh, sure.

16:50.367 --> 16:53.400
I'll be right back.
I think you'll be ok.

16:53.467 --> 16:55.734
So, Glen. How come you
cheated on your wife?

16:58.633 --> 17:02.700
Wow.
Straight to final jeopardy, huh?

17:02.767 --> 17:03.433
Ok.

17:03.500 --> 17:07.633
Bernice and I had been
separated emotionally for years

17:07.700 --> 17:10.767
when I met Dorothy,
and right or wrong,

17:10.834 --> 17:13.300
I've never been anything
but grateful that that happened.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.734
What else do you
want to know?

17:15.800 --> 17:18.500
Sophia,
I think it's time you stopped

17:18.567 --> 17:21.266
subjecting this nice man
to the third degree.

17:21.333 --> 17:22.734
I'm checking him out.

17:22.800 --> 17:24.400
Dorothy's smart and attractive,

17:24.467 --> 17:27.200
but when it comes to picking men,
she's all thumbs.

17:28.900 --> 17:31.333
But she's clean,
and she's got good teeth.

17:32.900 --> 17:33.900
Cannoli?

17:36.400 --> 17:39.800
I had to tell somebody.
I couldn't wait another minute.

17:39.867 --> 17:41.567
Glen asked me to marry him.

17:41.633 --> 17:44.934
Pay dirt!
Are you going to do it?

17:45.000 --> 17:47.467
I haven't had time
to make up my mind.

17:47.533 --> 17:48.633
Don't dawdle.

17:48.700 --> 17:52.700
Men have a short memory span
when it comes to that question.

17:52.767 --> 17:55.567
Sometimes they forget before
you get your clothes back on.

18:00.467 --> 18:02.900
Oh, Dorothy, Glen
is such a charmer.

18:02.967 --> 18:05.166
He and Sophia
are really getting along.

18:05.233 --> 18:08.467
Can I tell her? Glen asked
Dorothy to marry him.

18:08.533 --> 18:10.900
Do it!
Oh, marry him, Dorothy,

18:10.967 --> 18:15.033
even if you have to sign one
of those prenatal agreements.

18:19.433 --> 18:21.200
Oh, I'm so happy.

18:21.266 --> 18:25.033
Am I too happy?
Why am I so happy?

18:25.100 --> 18:27.233
Is this too good to be true?

18:27.300 --> 18:30.500
Such a pessimist,
always looking on the dark side.

18:30.567 --> 18:33.166
A fine pessimist I'd be if I didn't.

18:34.300 --> 18:36.767
-Oh, girls, group hug.
-Oh.

18:36.834 --> 18:38.300
Oh, Dorothy.

18:39.066 --> 18:41.100
(soft music playing)

18:42.834 --> 18:44.734
Ma, what are you doing up?

18:44.800 --> 18:47.300
Just having a Maalox moment.

18:53.567 --> 18:54.834
What about you?

18:54.900 --> 18:58.367
Oh, thinking about Glen.
This whole thing is so rushed.

18:58.433 --> 19:02.533
Ma, I'm afraid. I'm too old
to make another mistake.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.633
I don't want to make a fool
out of myself.

19:04.700 --> 19:08.166
You're never too old
to make a fool of yourself.

19:08.233 --> 19:11.200
Those were your words when
I told you I lost that money,

19:11.266 --> 19:14.800
and you were right.
I felt so stupid.

19:14.867 --> 19:16.567
I would've felt
more stupid

19:16.633 --> 19:18.500
if it had been my money
instead of yours.

19:19.800 --> 19:22.033
What should I do?

19:22.100 --> 19:24.667
No one can help you
with that decision.

19:24.734 --> 19:26.800
I can't tell you what to do.

19:26.867 --> 19:30.033
I won't be around forever.

19:30.100 --> 19:32.266
I'd like to know
there was someone here

19:32.333 --> 19:35.500
who would take care of you
like you take care of me.

19:35.567 --> 19:39.200
Maybe he could give you
a bigger allowance.

19:39.266 --> 19:41.667
It's nice now and then to buy
something that's not generic,

19:41.734 --> 19:45.433
you know what
I'm saying, Dorothy?

19:45.500 --> 19:46.900
Yes, Ma, and it's nice.

19:46.967 --> 19:50.133
You're saying
you love me and you care.

19:50.200 --> 19:54.367
No. I'm saying buy genuine Q-tips.

19:56.533 --> 19:59.867
If I'm putting a stick in my ear,
I'd like a little cotton at the end.

20:06.433 --> 20:08.400
Oh, remind me
before you leave.

20:08.467 --> 20:11.967
I got your mother
some anise cookies.

20:12.033 --> 20:14.066
You don't have to try so hard.

20:14.133 --> 20:18.200
I still can't believe how much
my mother liked you.

20:18.266 --> 20:20.000
I liked her too.

20:20.066 --> 20:21.467
One thing puzzled me though.

20:21.533 --> 20:23.800
When you were in the kitchen,
why did she keep asking

20:23.867 --> 20:27.433
if I'd lost this wallet
with $50 in it?

20:30.200 --> 20:32.300
My mom, the eternal girl scout.

20:34.700 --> 20:36.934
You were very quiet
on the way over.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.667
You gave me a lot to think about.

20:38.734 --> 20:40.767
You had to see it coming.

20:40.834 --> 20:43.133
I didn't expect it so soon.

20:43.200 --> 20:46.500
So marry me and take
me away from all this.

20:46.567 --> 20:48.333
-(telephone rings)
-Excuse me.

20:50.333 --> 20:52.233
Hello?

20:52.300 --> 20:54.500
Oh, hello, Bernice.

20:54.567 --> 20:55.467
No, I'm alone.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.567
Well, what do you want?

21:00.266 --> 21:02.166
Yeah, sure. I'll sign them tomorrow.

21:02.233 --> 21:03.467
Ok.

21:03.533 --> 21:04.934
Bye.

21:05.433 --> 21:06.633
I'm alone?

21:08.700 --> 21:12.934
It's going to take a while for
everybody to get used to this.

21:13.433 --> 21:16.834
So... what do you say,
will you marry me?

21:16.900 --> 21:20.200
I want to get my life together.
I'm really no good being single.

21:20.266 --> 21:23.867
Just look around.
I am looking and listening.

21:23.934 --> 21:28.066
I can't help remembering that
I've been in the room before

21:28.133 --> 21:31.166
when your wife called,
and you said you were alone.

21:31.233 --> 21:32.900
Then you were cheating on her.

21:32.967 --> 21:34.333
-With you.
-(Dorothy) Yes.

21:34.400 --> 21:38.400
But I've also been Bernice
and had my husband call me,

21:38.467 --> 21:41.233
and he was always alone too.

21:41.300 --> 21:45.633
I was married to Stanley
for 38 years.

21:45.700 --> 21:49.667
And for approximately for 39
of those years, he cheated on me.

21:51.233 --> 21:54.734
I told a little lie because
it's gonna take her some time

21:54.800 --> 21:56.967
to get used to the idea
of you and me.

21:57.033 --> 22:00.967
Well, I'm gonna need
a little time to get used to it to.

22:01.033 --> 22:04.333
Look,
I'm not saying you're a cheater.

22:04.400 --> 22:07.734
I'm not saying
that you're like Stan.

22:07.800 --> 22:10.367
I don't know, maybe there's
something wrong with me,

22:10.433 --> 22:13.033
that I'm not trusting enough, but...

22:14.333 --> 22:15.767
I'm going to need some time.

22:16.467 --> 22:20.266
So what are you telling me,
it's going to be months or years

22:20.333 --> 22:22.166
or maybe never?

22:22.233 --> 22:27.133
If we were both 25, I could wait,
but I need someone in my life now.

22:27.200 --> 22:29.166
Are you sure that you want
to marry me,

22:29.233 --> 22:32.800
or are you just afraid to be alone?

22:32.867 --> 22:34.867
Who wants to be alone?

22:35.333 --> 22:38.100
Nobody. I don't.

22:38.166 --> 22:40.533
But if you're marrying me

22:40.600 --> 22:43.767
because I happen to be
on the top of the list, then...

22:45.600 --> 22:48.100
maybe I shouldn't be on the list.

22:50.166 --> 22:52.633
So I guess this is it, huh?

22:53.133 --> 22:55.500
I guess so.

22:55.567 --> 22:57.400
I still love you, Dorothy.

22:57.467 --> 22:58.767
I love you too.

23:04.233 --> 23:07.200
-If you change your mind...
-If you change yours.

23:13.867 --> 23:16.667
No reason my mother
shouldn't have the cookies.

23:24.367 --> 23:28.900
(theme music playing)
