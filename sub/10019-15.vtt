00:29.051 --> 00:31.026
Hello?

00:31.227 --> 00:33.813
Who's this?
And why are you calling at 7 a.m.?

00:34.427 --> 00:38.770
It's just a day off. No big deal.
Yes, I usually do work Fridays.

00:40.027 --> 00:41.369
Huh?

00:41.595 --> 00:47.378
Marshall Field's?
No, no. I've got enough sheets.

00:48.475 --> 00:53.015
What? No, I've got a lot of stuff
around the house to do.

00:53.180 --> 00:55.962
No, I don't need your help.

00:56.155 --> 00:59.155
No. Mom? Mom?

00:59.356 --> 01:03.218
Mom! I don't need your help,
but thank you.

01:03.419 --> 01:06.201
No. Go check out the sale, okay?

01:06.428 --> 01:08.762
Okay. Bye.

01:26.043 --> 01:28.018
- Good morning, Leon.
- Good morning, Carol.

01:28.219 --> 01:32.758
- I hate going to work when it's cold.
- I know what you mean.

01:33.916 --> 01:37.396
- Hey, Leon! Hi, Miss Hathaway!
- Slow down, Robert!

01:37.596 --> 01:39.122
I hate that
he calls me "Miss Hathaway."

01:39.324 --> 01:42.073
It's a real crime
when kids show respect.

01:43.035 --> 01:47.792
- Have a good one. Happy Valentine's Day!
- I forgot! You too!

02:12.412 --> 02:14.386
- Hi.
- Hey. Good morning.

02:16.668 --> 02:19.002
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

02:19.163 --> 02:21.651
- Good morning, Mrs. Novotny.
- Good morning.

02:21.851 --> 02:27.154
- No dog cans. The little biscuits.
- Okay, the little biscuits.

02:28.507 --> 02:31.987
Hey. It's for my wife.
I think she has an ulcer.

02:32.187 --> 02:35.034
- Which one should she take?
- Sorry, I can't help you.

02:35.227 --> 02:38.642
This one says four times a day.
This one, two times.

02:38.844 --> 02:42.455
I just do the baked goods.
Know what I mean?

02:42.651 --> 02:44.473
Miss, can...

02:48.667 --> 02:51.187
Just go now.
No problems. I don't call anyone.

02:51.420 --> 02:52.946
- The money!
- Should've waited.

02:53.148 --> 02:55.482
- Shut up!
- I need more space for the muffins.

02:55.643 --> 03:00.280
Hang on. I'm not
doing anything. I'm not moving.

03:00.476 --> 03:02.614
- Get them down!
- Let's go!

03:02.811 --> 03:04.600
- What are you doing?
- Get them down!

03:04.795 --> 03:08.537
Get down! Face down!
You too! Go on!

03:10.076 --> 03:14.516
- Don't look at me!
- James, let's just go.

03:14.683 --> 03:18.425
Didn't you hear him?
He said, "Get down!" So get down!

03:22.491 --> 03:26.037
- Okay, that's it. Let's go.
- Stop right there, you bastards.

03:26.748 --> 03:27.860
Come on.

03:29.339 --> 03:31.062
Joseph, go back!

03:39.451 --> 03:41.655
- Anton!
- Jesus! Come on!

03:41.852 --> 03:43.542
Anton!

03:49.243 --> 03:52.538
Please, he needs help! Please!

03:52.731 --> 03:54.258
- Police car down the street.
- God!

03:54.491 --> 03:57.753
- Don't just stand there!
- Where's the back?

04:00.475 --> 04:03.225
Damn it! Where are the keys?

04:03.419 --> 04:05.940
- Give me the keys!
- He needs help.

04:06.108 --> 04:08.497
Just give us the keys.

04:09.563 --> 04:11.702
Just give us the keys.

04:11.899 --> 04:15.609
Leave him alone, you bastard!
Leave him alone!

04:15.804 --> 04:18.389
- Duncan, I need help.
- Sure.

04:18.588 --> 04:21.305
I'll get you some help.
Just give me a minute.

04:21.499 --> 04:23.441
Everyone just stay where they are.

04:23.643 --> 04:26.807
Got it? I don't want anyone
moving or talking.

04:27.035 --> 04:29.304
I want everyone
to stay where they are.

05:18.331 --> 05:24.114
- Anton! Anton!
- Check out the guys on the floor.

05:24.347 --> 05:27.314
Over there.
Two of them on the floor.

05:27.515 --> 05:29.337
We should've waited
until the customers left.

05:29.563 --> 05:30.807
The welfare checks are out today.

05:30.971 --> 05:34.452
People come in to cash them.
If we wait, we miss the money.

05:35.515 --> 05:37.588
Oh, man! Jeez!

05:37.819 --> 05:40.307
- How many?
- Just a couple so far.

05:44.475 --> 05:47.225
- Get us some help!
- Robert!

05:47.419 --> 05:50.201
- Get behind the freezer.
- I don't want anybody moving around!

05:50.427 --> 05:53.111
- Nobody's moving, right?
- He needs a doctor!

05:53.307 --> 05:55.576
- Shut up!
- Get behind the freezer.

05:55.771 --> 05:57.494
- Shut up!
- We've gotta go!

05:57.691 --> 06:00.146
- Shut up, I'm thinking!
- Just listen to me.

06:00.348 --> 06:03.479
Get behind those crates.
Crawl in behind those crates.

06:03.707 --> 06:07.831
I wouldn't do that.
I just told him not to move.

06:09.915 --> 06:11.027
Come here.

06:11.195 --> 06:15.319
- Please! We need a doctor for him!
- I said get over here!

06:15.515 --> 06:18.482
- I don't want to.
- You don't want to?

06:18.683 --> 06:21.236
- What the fly...?
- It's okay. Come over here by me.

06:22.299 --> 06:25.266
- Please!
- Come on. That's it.

06:25.467 --> 06:28.631
Come on, it's okay. Quick.

06:32.859 --> 06:35.030
Brilliant.

06:36.476 --> 06:39.094
<i>Clear the area</i>
<i>for emergency vehicles.</i>

06:39.291 --> 06:44.212
- Please! He needs help!
- Shut your mouth!

06:44.379 --> 06:47.957
I need help here too!
Duncan, would you shut her up?

06:48.155 --> 06:51.188
- Help us! Please!
- Shut up!

06:51.387 --> 06:55.348
Lady, what are we supposed to do?
Stop your yapping now!

06:55.579 --> 07:02.256
Wait! I'm a nurse. And maybe I
can help him, and then she'll be quiet.

07:02.459 --> 07:05.142
- Won't you, Mrs. Novotny?
- This is a bit of luck. A nurse!

07:05.339 --> 07:07.030
- Get her over here.
- What's your name?

07:07.931 --> 07:11.641
- Carol.
- Maybe you can help my cousin.

07:11.835 --> 07:13.428
Her husband is worse off.

07:13.595 --> 07:16.530
Take a look at my cousin first,
or he'll be really pissed off.

07:16.731 --> 07:19.579
Go on.
You go with her, Robert.

07:19.771 --> 07:23.416
No. Please. He's just a little boy.
He shouldn't see things like that.

07:23.611 --> 07:27.256
No one should! Now go on.
You go with her.

07:29.595 --> 07:31.318
Go on!

07:34.171 --> 07:38.394
- I think I'm gonna throw up.
- Don't look, Robert.

07:38.971 --> 07:41.590
Robert, don't look. You'll be fine.

07:44.251 --> 07:46.585
- What's your name?
- Don't point that at me.

07:49.147 --> 07:51.830
- Stay over here!
- Where am I gonna go? 7-Eleven?

07:52.027 --> 07:54.394
And no talking either! Over here!

07:56.411 --> 07:58.069
Please!

08:00.315 --> 08:03.249
Please! Please, someone!

08:04.379 --> 08:06.616
Please!

08:09.563 --> 08:13.207
- Duncan, don't go anywhere!
- I won't!

08:13.403 --> 08:17.015
- Stay where I can see you.
- I'm not going. The police's outside.

08:17.211 --> 08:19.732
I need to take your pulse.

08:21.755 --> 08:24.439
- Jesus!
- I must take the pulse in your neck!

08:30.139 --> 08:32.756
- Should we get that?
- Just let it ring.

08:32.955 --> 08:34.897
Help us!

08:36.571 --> 08:39.255
- What's the matter with the old boy?
- I'm fine.

08:39.451 --> 08:43.412
- I think he hurt his wrist.
- God! You'd think I shot everyone.

08:43.611 --> 08:46.196
You look fairly strong,
but remember I've got the gun.

08:46.395 --> 08:47.824
I'm not doing anything!

08:48.539 --> 08:53.973
- You should answer the phone.
- Please! We need a doctor for him!

08:54.171 --> 08:57.586
Get him some help! Please!

08:57.787 --> 09:00.308
- Please!
- Maybe we should get that.

09:00.507 --> 09:03.890
- I need a minute to think.
- Maybe it's not for you.

09:04.123 --> 09:06.708
The wound's serious. The bullet may
have hit your kidney or spleen.

09:06.907 --> 09:09.874
- Just stop the bleeding.
- We need a doctor.

09:10.043 --> 09:12.945
We're not getting anyone.
Do it yourself!

09:13.147 --> 09:17.620
- I don't have the supplies!
- Look around, got a whole store full.

09:22.810 --> 09:25.363
- Okay.
- He stays with me.

09:26.683 --> 09:28.690
Let her go.
She's looking for some stuff.

09:28.891 --> 09:30.549
- Your friend...
- My cousin.

09:30.747 --> 09:33.168
If he doesn't get to a hospital,
he'll bleed to death.

09:33.979 --> 09:38.135
Help him!
Please! Get an ambulance.

09:40.187 --> 09:43.536
Please help us! Please!

09:47.739 --> 09:49.233
Get an ambulance!

09:52.507 --> 09:54.449
Carol!

10:02.459 --> 10:06.037
Duncan, get something
in front of the door.

10:06.235 --> 10:08.952
You, come with me.
Up. Go around there.

10:10.747 --> 10:14.096
We're gonna move this
over there, okay?

10:16.155 --> 10:18.708
- Kind of a heavy sucker, huh?
- I just stocked it.

10:18.907 --> 10:21.907
I love America!
Everyone has a job here.

10:23.739 --> 10:28.180
- You! Do you have a job?
- Yeah. I teach school.

10:28.987 --> 10:31.224
- What?
- I teach school. First grade.

10:31.419 --> 10:34.354
Good. If you get them young,
you can teach them right.

10:34.555 --> 10:37.403
- I guess no one got to you, huh?
- She has a mouth.

10:37.595 --> 10:39.602
- Stop chatting!
- Get down there!

10:42.811 --> 10:45.560
- This will stop it for now.
- Good.

10:45.755 --> 10:48.373
I'll come back
and change it in a while.

10:49.466 --> 10:51.255
- Do you need me?
- For what?

10:51.451 --> 10:55.345
- I'll just check on the old man.
- Whatever.

10:57.979 --> 11:01.208
Pray for us sinners now.

11:04.922 --> 11:07.672
Oh, Lord, blessed art Thou...

11:09.339 --> 11:13.365
Mrs. Novotny?
Mrs. Novotny, I need you!

11:14.139 --> 11:16.822
I'm gonna do five compressions
in a row. And on the fifth...

11:17.019 --> 11:20.052
...I want you to hold his nose
and blow into his mouth.

11:20.282 --> 11:24.952
- The cops are moving the cars back.
- One, two, three, four, five.

11:25.147 --> 11:27.634
- I need help.
- She's helping.

11:27.835 --> 11:30.290
- Why do they do that?
- I don't know. You're the American!

11:30.459 --> 11:34.769
I can't do this! I need medical
supplies, IV fluid, monitors!

11:34.971 --> 11:36.880
- Shut her up!
- Someone must do CPR.

11:37.083 --> 11:39.538
- I can do it!
- You don't move!

11:39.738 --> 11:43.251
- You sit there and say nothing.
- Listen, Duncan!

11:43.451 --> 11:46.036
You do not want this man to die.

11:46.267 --> 11:50.129
Those cops consider that a much
bigger deal. Now, I need some help!

11:51.610 --> 11:54.839
Can you do this CPR thing?

11:55.067 --> 11:58.482
<i>We just wanna know if everyone's</i>
<i>all right. If anyone needs help.</i>

11:58.682 --> 12:00.438
<i>Answer the phone...</i>

12:00.635 --> 12:04.694
- I got straws, but I couldn't find...
- Rubbing alcohol. That's okay.

12:04.859 --> 12:07.062
Get me any kind of liquor.

12:07.259 --> 12:09.528
Grain alcohol is the strongest.

12:09.723 --> 12:12.057
<i>Does anyone need</i>
<i>a doctor or other help?</i>

12:12.251 --> 12:14.902
<i>That's all we need to know.</i>
<i>You got that?</i>

12:15.099 --> 12:19.093
- We've gotta think what to tell them.
- Tell them anything.

12:19.291 --> 12:23.415
<i>We need you to talk with us.</i>
<i>Let us know what's going on.</i>

12:23.642 --> 12:26.839
- I should just keep going, right?
- Yeah.

12:32.635 --> 12:34.839
You can move back now, Mrs. Novotny.

12:36.667 --> 12:40.377
- You can move back now.
- Marita.

12:47.642 --> 12:48.853
Okay.

12:51.482 --> 12:53.173
All right.

13:01.594 --> 13:03.417
Okay. It's okay.

13:04.859 --> 13:07.794
Robert, pour some on the straw.

13:08.891 --> 13:11.346
- Robert!
- I'll do it.

13:13.978 --> 13:17.939
- We need to get out of here.
- I know. I just need to think.

13:18.170 --> 13:22.131
- You weren't thinking at all.
- So it's all my fault?

13:22.299 --> 13:24.241
It was your bloody idea!

13:30.011 --> 13:33.808
- Is that it?
- Yeah. He's breathing.

13:36.027 --> 13:38.099
He's got a pulse.
Stop the compressions.

13:38.299 --> 13:40.917
- Good. That means you've got it.
- Quiet, I'm trying to listen.

13:43.034 --> 13:47.955
- He's breathing, but he looks blue.
- He'll be fine. We're gonna do this!

13:48.186 --> 13:52.180
- What is it? Is he all right?
- I need an ice pick.

13:52.378 --> 13:53.939
- By the freezer.
- I'll get it.

13:54.138 --> 13:56.593
No, stay there.
I'll get the ice pick.

13:56.795 --> 14:01.432
- I need a tiny straw. This is too big.
- We don't have that.

14:01.659 --> 14:05.488
- The cardboard juices have straws.
- Robert, get those!

14:05.691 --> 14:08.538
- Robert, now!
- How long is this gonna take?

14:09.371 --> 14:11.640
Have you got someplace to go?

14:11.803 --> 14:14.737
I shot the man.
If he pops off, it's my ass.

14:14.939 --> 14:17.143
Like I'm gonna get probation.

14:30.747 --> 14:33.016
- Should I start again?
- No.

14:35.226 --> 14:38.543
<i>We need to know how many people</i>
<i>are there and if they're all right.</i>

14:38.747 --> 14:42.096
<i>Are you guys all right?</i>
<i>Get on the phone.</i>

14:42.267 --> 14:45.714
<i>If you need help,</i>
<i>we can work something out.</i>

14:56.890 --> 14:59.738
- What are we doing now?
- He needs a chest tube.

14:59.930 --> 15:02.418
- Do it.
- It's not what I do. I'm a nurse.

15:02.587 --> 15:05.140
We need supplies.
You've gotta send in a doctor.

15:05.338 --> 15:09.528
- They'd love that chance.
- Please. You have to help him.

15:18.682 --> 15:25.044
Okay. Third, no, fifth intercostal
neurovascular bundle above the rib.

15:29.147 --> 15:35.257
Screwdriver. Pour liquor on it, open
the tampons and pull out the tube.

15:42.555 --> 15:44.464
Cut me a piece of tape.

15:49.275 --> 15:51.250
Give me the tampon.

15:53.723 --> 15:55.130
All right, tape.

15:59.610 --> 16:00.756
More tape.

16:04.315 --> 16:05.907
Great.

16:11.547 --> 16:15.671
Okay, blow into his trach tube.
We've lost his pulse.

16:15.899 --> 16:17.906
- Should I start CPR?
- No, I've got it.

16:18.106 --> 16:19.252
- What's your name?
- Angie.

16:19.418 --> 16:22.386
I've got it from now, Angie. Thanks.

16:24.506 --> 16:26.677
Come on. Come on!

16:29.658 --> 16:32.276
You can't do it, can you?

16:36.378 --> 16:39.160
Come on.

16:40.763 --> 16:43.152
Come on. Come on.

16:48.347 --> 16:50.835
Come on.

17:22.458 --> 17:25.458
Your cousin's losing more blood.
There's nothing I can do.

17:25.657 --> 17:27.633
- We'll get out of this.
- Yeah, right.

17:27.834 --> 17:31.217
- Shut up and keep dragging.
- I have to go to the bathroom.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.557
- He goes nowhere.
- He's just a kid!

17:33.755 --> 17:35.794
You don't want him throwing up here.

17:35.995 --> 17:38.329
It's okay.
There's no way out of the bathroom.

17:38.522 --> 17:41.751
- Hey.
- Come on.

17:41.978 --> 17:45.688
<i>Guys, listen to me.</i>
<i>I don't need to talk to both of you.</i>

17:45.914 --> 17:51.097
<i>Just figure out who wants to get on</i>
<i>the phone and start working with us.</i>

17:51.258 --> 17:55.382
Duncan, you've gotta help your cousin.
He's gotta get to a hospital.

17:55.578 --> 17:57.848
And I have to go to
one of your fine prisons.

17:58.011 --> 18:00.432
They'll go easier on you.
You've never killed before.

18:00.666 --> 18:03.797
- How do you know that?
- You haven't, have you?

18:03.994 --> 18:07.507
Duncan, what the hell's
taking so long?

18:07.738 --> 18:09.047
Come on.

18:09.210 --> 18:11.796
<i>You've got to start working with me.</i>

18:16.538 --> 18:19.124
Hey! It's me, Javier.

18:21.211 --> 18:23.251
Quiet, quiet.

18:23.450 --> 18:26.385
There's a door behind me,
but it's locked.

18:26.619 --> 18:29.074
- I've got a baseball bat.
- No! They'll shoot you.

18:29.243 --> 18:32.243
Stay right there.
I'll try to get the keys.

18:32.987 --> 18:35.354
Hang on! Don't move!

18:36.059 --> 18:39.288
- What are you gonna tell them?
- I'll ask for a truck or a van.

18:39.514 --> 18:42.383
- Tell them to send medical supplies.
- Like what?

18:42.554 --> 18:44.921
- What medical stuff do we need?
- Don't be stupid.

18:45.146 --> 18:48.376
Four units of O-negative blood,
IVs, saline.

18:48.539 --> 18:51.473
- So she'll fix me up and we'll leave?
- Maybe!

18:51.675 --> 18:54.096
They'll send in the supplies
with a cop.

18:55.098 --> 18:57.106
Now look what you did!

18:57.306 --> 18:58.932
I don't like the big guy.
Tape him up.

18:59.099 --> 19:00.593
- What?
- Tape him up. I don't like him.

19:02.522 --> 19:06.319
- I don't like her moving around.
- She's trying to help.

19:06.939 --> 19:09.077
- Put this on.
- Thanks.

19:11.802 --> 19:14.584
This wouldn't be necessary
if you hadn't shot the coffeepot.

19:14.811 --> 19:19.120
- Don't talk back to them.
- Shoot the cold drinks next time.

19:19.322 --> 19:22.039
- There won't be a next time!
- What did I do?

19:22.234 --> 19:25.366
- You don't rob a shop with customers!
- I was shot by the owner.

19:25.594 --> 19:27.634
- You wouldn't listen!
- Listen to you?

19:27.834 --> 19:30.387
- Where are the keys?
- The keys?

19:30.587 --> 19:34.132
To the door off the storeroom.
Javier's hiding in there.

19:34.298 --> 19:37.746
- He could get out.
- First shelf under the counter.

19:37.946 --> 19:40.150
- I'll try to get there.
- Okay.

19:40.795 --> 19:43.380
- What's taking that kid so long?
- He's throwing up. Give him a break!

19:43.546 --> 19:47.124
<i>I want to talk to the hostages now!</i>
<i>I want everyone to know...</i>

19:47.322 --> 19:50.737
- Don't they ever shut up?
<i>- We're all gonna stay calm.</i>

19:50.939 --> 19:53.426
<i>- We'll solve this quietly.</i>
- You have a fracture dislocation.

19:53.658 --> 19:56.920
I should reduce it, but that'll hurt.
Take a drink of that liquor.

19:57.115 --> 20:00.693
I couldn't do that.
I'm an alcoholic.

20:02.138 --> 20:04.026
- Can you get us some aspirin?
- Yeah.

20:04.187 --> 20:06.805
No, I can do it.

20:09.658 --> 20:12.211
- Where are you going?
- To get some aspirin.

20:13.306 --> 20:14.583
I saw them over there.

20:18.779 --> 20:20.567
- Try not to shoot it.
- Angie.

20:22.523 --> 20:25.043
- Try not to shoot the aspirin.
- That's not funny.

20:25.594 --> 20:30.744
Maybe the old man will toss up his
Alka-Seltzer for some target practice?

20:30.970 --> 20:34.679
- Shut up.
- Shoot the row of dishwashing liquid.

20:34.874 --> 20:38.736
- That's not funny!
- Shoot the lights while you're at it.

20:38.938 --> 20:42.768
- You can shoot...
- Wasn't my husband enough?

20:42.970 --> 20:45.207
He shot him here and here.

20:45.434 --> 20:48.336
- Mrs. Novotny.
- He could only bleed and bleed.

20:49.242 --> 20:53.432
He couldn't move,
he couldn't breathe, he couldn't talk.

20:53.658 --> 20:58.840
He couldn't say goodbye.
He couldn't say how much he loved me.

20:59.003 --> 21:02.712
I wanted to hear him say that
just one more time!

21:04.730 --> 21:07.480
You see? I shot her old man!

21:07.643 --> 21:11.833
I killed her husband! And a good job
I did too, before he shot you again.

21:12.026 --> 21:15.605
You didn't thank me for that!
Where's the flipping kid?

21:15.802 --> 21:18.584
- Wait a minute.
- He's been in there half my life!

21:18.778 --> 21:20.850
- Lf he's sick, he might need me.
- Yeah, whatever.

21:21.050 --> 21:24.879
Hey, kid!
Kid, are you still in there?

21:25.082 --> 21:28.049
Come out!
You can't throw up forever!

21:28.282 --> 21:32.276
We're all eating free hot dogs.
Don't you want one?

21:32.474 --> 21:35.409
Stupid thing to say
if he's chucking up. You try.

21:36.538 --> 21:40.248
Robert, come out now!
It's me, Carol!

21:40.442 --> 21:45.231
- It's Miss Hathaway.
- Miss Hathaway? That's very sweet.

21:45.434 --> 21:47.736
Come in.

21:47.930 --> 21:50.712
<i>It'll go a lot easier on you.</i>
<i>We're gonna stay here...</i>

21:50.906 --> 21:53.840
Do you feel any better? Hm?

21:54.074 --> 21:56.758
That's good. We can go back out now.

21:59.962 --> 22:02.962
Duncan doesn't like me.

22:03.162 --> 22:05.267
Well...

22:05.434 --> 22:09.777
...Duncan doesn't like any of us.
But you're gonna be okay.

22:10.010 --> 22:13.174
- You don't know that.
- No, I don't.

22:13.338 --> 22:17.200
There are a lot of police out there
who are gonna come in here and help us.

22:17.402 --> 22:21.047
Duncan will shoot them
like he shot Mr. Novotny.

22:21.242 --> 22:23.031
He can't shoot them all.

22:23.226 --> 22:28.245
- Are there 80 of them or something?
- Or something.

22:29.499 --> 22:31.920
What if they don't shoot
at the same time?

22:34.042 --> 22:36.464
Then we'll have to duck.

22:39.355 --> 22:42.289
- Why did you take your shoes off?
- My feet were hot.

22:43.195 --> 22:47.286
Put them back on
so we can join the others, okay?

23:05.275 --> 23:09.530
I suppose you see a lot of dead people
in your line of work.

23:09.690 --> 23:11.599
Yeah.

23:13.850 --> 23:17.592
- This is just the way it is.
- Yes.

23:19.162 --> 23:23.091
- I guess you sort of get used to it.
- Not really.

23:24.827 --> 23:26.353
Hey! There you go!

23:27.674 --> 23:29.365
Hey! What are you...?

23:29.914 --> 23:32.980
- Robert, come out! Robert!
- Duncan, what did you do?

23:33.178 --> 23:35.796
- Come here!
- Get away from me!

23:36.026 --> 23:38.230
- You can't catch a kid?
- You're not helping.

23:38.394 --> 23:40.947
- I'm not coming out!
- Leave him! Who cares?

23:41.147 --> 23:43.797
- Come out now!
- Get away from me!

23:44.026 --> 23:46.230
- Come here!
- Let go!

23:46.394 --> 23:49.177
- Don't hurt him!
- I'm not gonna hurt him.

23:49.370 --> 23:52.883
I'm just gonna kill him.
James, answer the fucking phone!

23:53.082 --> 23:55.635
You're coming with me.
Sit in the corner.

23:55.866 --> 23:58.233
Get down and stay there!

23:58.394 --> 24:02.289
No. Better still, I want you
feeding quarters into that thing.

24:02.490 --> 24:06.200
Both hands on it at all times!
I'm gonna answer that phone!

24:06.426 --> 24:08.793
I wanna hear "ping, ping, ping"
coming from this direction.

24:08.954 --> 24:12.216
If I don't hear it, I'll probably turn
around and shoot. Okay?

24:12.442 --> 24:14.417
Ping, ping, ping!

24:14.618 --> 24:18.774
We all know I shot the coffeepot,
so I'm not afraid of shooting this...

24:18.938 --> 24:21.557
...or anything in the way of this thing!

24:21.754 --> 24:23.827
Get down! Bread man, down!

24:24.986 --> 24:27.539
Miss Hathaway,
tend to my poor cousin, James!

24:27.738 --> 24:31.185
He's so weak,
he can't even pick up the phone.

24:32.026 --> 24:36.947
What do you want?
We're fine. It's sweet of you to ask!

24:37.178 --> 24:41.237
We don't want anything except a van
or a truck. Or how about a tank?

24:42.874 --> 24:47.446
We don't need medical help.
Nurse Hathaway can handle it herself.

24:49.722 --> 24:52.689
They don't think you can handle this.
They want to send in a doctor.

24:54.554 --> 24:59.443
I think she resents
the implications of that. We all do.

25:03.162 --> 25:05.431
Hey, come down from there!

25:06.138 --> 25:08.559
Get away from me! Leave me alone!

25:08.794 --> 25:12.089
Let go! Get away from me!

25:15.322 --> 25:18.705
There are dead cats up there.
Do you want dead cats in your face?

25:18.938 --> 25:20.727
Let go! Get away!

25:24.314 --> 25:25.459
Hey! Hey, hey.

25:34.554 --> 25:38.100
<i>- That's what I need you to do now.</i>
- We need to start, Duncan.

25:38.298 --> 25:42.771
- God, how long does that go on for?
- I'm gonna start now, okay?

25:42.970 --> 25:45.686
<i>- We know everyone's okay.</i>
<i>That's our only concern.</i>

25:45.882 --> 25:48.632
Robert's told them
all about us by now.

25:48.826 --> 25:51.609
"The Scottish one,
he killed the old man...

25:51.834 --> 25:54.136
...burnt the teacher
and stole my shoe."

25:54.330 --> 25:57.330
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know. I need time to think.

25:57.498 --> 25:59.385
He's bleeding badly.

25:59.610 --> 26:04.367
I don't know how much time he has left
if we don't get him to a hospital.

26:04.570 --> 26:08.367
I can keep changing his bandages,
but it's not gonna matter.

26:08.570 --> 26:09.780
Shut up.

26:10.938 --> 26:15.957
Don't talk to me like that.
I'm just trying to help him.

26:16.186 --> 26:22.351
- Do you have any glue?
- Yes, on the shelf behind the counter.

26:30.106 --> 26:35.540
I know. Ask for a chopper to fly us
to a boat on Lake Michigan.

26:35.738 --> 26:37.712
The lake is frozen.

26:37.946 --> 26:42.735
- We'll get an ice sailing boat.
- I did that once...

26:42.938 --> 26:47.728
...a couple of winters ago
up in Lake Geneva. It was incredible.

26:47.930 --> 26:51.825
- They're really fast, right?
- 60 miles an hour.

26:51.994 --> 26:55.539
- Felt like 100.
- They wouldn't catch us at that speed.

26:55.770 --> 26:58.487
- We'd be home free.
- Sure, home free.

27:05.466 --> 27:08.728
- What are you doing?
- The cut's too deep, I can't close it.

27:08.922 --> 27:12.369
- Unless you want needle and thread.
- No, glue's fine.

27:14.521 --> 27:17.685
You weren't lying
about his bleeding, were you?

27:20.026 --> 27:22.808
You have to give up now, Duncan.

27:23.706 --> 27:28.179
Duncan, maybe we should go
to that place you told me about.

27:28.410 --> 27:30.799
- Fifth of something.
- Firth of Clyde.

27:31.898 --> 27:36.088
- We can take a ferry.
- Yeah, to the island of Great Cumbrae.

27:37.082 --> 27:40.791
And then sneak a boat to Little
Cumbrae because it's privately owned.

27:41.562 --> 27:46.712
You can get caught. It's worth it if
the sun's out and the Firth is blue.

27:46.906 --> 27:49.906
The big, purple mountains of Arran
jut up in the background.

27:50.138 --> 27:53.455
- Sounds beautiful.
- I've never been there.

27:53.626 --> 27:54.870
Never seen the Firth.

27:56.409 --> 28:00.119
I should have pledged at Hogmanay
to go to Little Cumbrae.

28:00.346 --> 28:03.892
A clean break with the past.
A fresh start.

28:04.058 --> 28:07.800
But I came to America instead
to stay with my cousin.

28:08.026 --> 28:12.728
My father thought I was crazy.
He works on the shipyards in Glasgow.

28:12.985 --> 28:16.498
Thirty years loading on and off.

28:16.730 --> 28:20.886
Got me the same job when I was 19.
I was laid off by 20.

28:21.050 --> 28:23.636
It's a good job,
but I wanted something else.

28:23.834 --> 28:28.341
- I wanted to be something more.
- I have too.

28:28.570 --> 28:31.504
- With all you can do? Why?
- I don't know.

28:33.882 --> 28:36.664
So then I end up in here.

28:38.458 --> 28:42.767
Duncan Stuart comes to America,
and one morning he comes in here.

28:43.642 --> 28:47.254
- We just needed the money.
- But look what we got! Look!

28:47.482 --> 28:50.264
You're a bloody mess,
and I don't know what to do.

28:50.458 --> 28:54.036
- But you're all right.
- I'm not all right! I killed a man!

28:54.586 --> 28:57.236
I killed a man!
Do you know what that feels like?

28:57.466 --> 29:00.248
Do you know what that feels like?

29:00.858 --> 29:02.003
- Do you?
- I do.

29:05.626 --> 29:08.408
I killed a man.
I gave him the wrong blood.

29:08.634 --> 29:11.416
- You didn't mean to kill him.
- You didn't mean to kill Mr. Novotny.

29:11.610 --> 29:13.999
How many of those cops
will care about that?

29:17.082 --> 29:20.431
It's all right, James.
I'll get us out of this somehow.

29:20.634 --> 29:24.180
I have to think of something, I don't
know what. Something.

29:25.593 --> 29:28.343
Maybe Robert had the right idea.
Maybe that's the way out...

29:28.538 --> 29:31.702
...if we stack the crates
high enough to support the ceiling.

29:33.529 --> 29:35.864
- Duncan, behind you!
- Don't, Duncan!

29:36.026 --> 29:39.092
You already know what it feels like,
but now you'll mean it. Don't!

29:39.289 --> 29:41.013
- Don't!
- Where were you?

29:41.850 --> 29:44.436
Where the hell were you?!
Where were you?!

29:44.634 --> 29:48.115
- In the storeroom by the door.
- You're saying there's a door?

29:48.314 --> 29:51.991
Here! Just take them!
Take the keys, Duncan.

30:01.786 --> 30:05.201
<i>We're gonna wait for him to get here</i>
<i>because he wants to talk to you...</i>

30:06.265 --> 30:09.582
- Where does it go?
- It's a fire escape.

30:09.753 --> 30:13.682
The ladder leads up to
the apartment building behind us.

30:13.882 --> 30:18.519
- There's a building behind us?
- You're coming with me.

30:23.962 --> 30:25.784
Don't move your wrists.
You'll be fine.

30:25.977 --> 30:30.233
- I hope it's you who'll be fine.
- James, I have to go.

30:30.425 --> 30:33.273
There's a way out. I have to go.

30:33.466 --> 30:37.776
- I don't want to leave you, but...
- We should've waited.

30:39.450 --> 30:42.745
They'll take good care of you.
I know they will.

30:45.466 --> 30:47.376
Come on, let's go.

31:17.018 --> 31:18.840
Go on.

31:37.082 --> 31:38.870
We'll take the long way around.

32:26.777 --> 32:30.192
We did it, Miss Hathaway.
We did it.

32:30.394 --> 32:34.191
When we get to the end of the alley,
I want you to let me go.

32:36.762 --> 32:38.169
Sure.

32:39.034 --> 32:41.816
I wouldn't want you to slow me down.

32:42.809 --> 32:45.679
<i>Hold it right there.</i>
<i>Stop right there, please.</i>

32:49.561 --> 32:53.271
- Stop! Is that one of them?
- Yes. Don't run, Duncan!

32:53.465 --> 32:56.116
- Stop or I'll shoot!
- Don't run!

33:03.034 --> 33:04.976
Call the paramedics!

33:05.177 --> 33:08.755
Unit 24-18.
I'm in the alley behind 3312 Wolcott.

33:08.954 --> 33:11.539
I've got one offender down.
I need a wagon or an ambulance.

33:11.738 --> 33:15.699
What about the other suspect?
The other suspect!

33:15.897 --> 33:18.385
Internal bleeding. He's still inside,
probably passed out.

33:18.585 --> 33:21.335
Second suspect is inside,
possibly unconscious.

33:21.530 --> 33:23.188
Come on!

33:26.138 --> 33:28.658
Get the paramedics!

33:32.313 --> 33:34.353
- Clear Trauma 2!
- Are you all right?

33:34.522 --> 33:37.140
- Are you hurt?
- Clear Trauma 2!

33:37.338 --> 33:39.476
Duncan Stuart.
Multiple GSW to chest and thigh.

33:39.674 --> 33:42.194
Two liters saline in.
Gave high-dose epi for P.E.A.

33:42.394 --> 33:45.841
James Roger. Single entrance,
lower abdomen. Massive blood loss.

33:46.073 --> 33:50.002
BP's 80/45. Pulse is 144.
Good breath sounds bilaterally.

33:51.354 --> 33:55.762
- Okay, on my count...
- On my count! One, two, three, go!

33:57.818 --> 34:01.560
Give me two more saline.
Four of O-neg up on the rapid infuser.

34:02.777 --> 34:04.599
We've got spontaneous respiration.
Hold the CPR.

34:04.794 --> 34:08.143
Okay, let's move him.
One, two, three.

34:08.344 --> 34:10.134
- Where's Benton?
- Appendectomy.

34:10.329 --> 34:12.947
- He's got a pulse!
- Morgenstern? He needs a surgeon.

34:13.145 --> 34:14.257
I've got it.

34:15.257 --> 34:17.712
Duncan. Duncan.

34:17.914 --> 34:23.347
Hang in there, okay? Think of all the
beautiful places you told us about.

34:23.578 --> 34:26.447
Think about the Firth of Clyde
and Little Cumbrae.

34:26.618 --> 34:30.676
- Hang in there. You'll pull through.
- Are you all right?

34:30.873 --> 34:32.498
Yeah, I'm fine.

34:34.617 --> 34:38.065
- We lost his pulse!
- I'll intubate him. 7.5 ET tube.

34:38.264 --> 34:41.167
- We need a portable chest.
- Two units in.

34:44.409 --> 34:47.824
- Please.
- We need to tube. I'm done.

34:49.754 --> 34:52.023
Pulse ox's 85. BP's 75/50.

34:52.248 --> 34:55.446
- Sinus tach at 150. Pulse thready.
- Cap refill's poor.

34:55.610 --> 34:58.130
No exit wound.
Probably got the spleen.

34:58.298 --> 35:02.870
Give him a gram of cefoxitin.
CBC, type and cross for six.

35:03.098 --> 35:05.040
- Still no pulse.
- Low breath sounds on the right.

35:05.210 --> 35:08.057
- He needs a chest tube.
- Haleh, take over!

35:09.369 --> 35:11.824
I'll do the Foley.
Malik, dip a urine for blood.

35:12.057 --> 35:14.774
- Duncan needs a chest tube.
- Duncan?

35:14.970 --> 35:17.206
- The patient in 2.
- Doug can handle the tube.

35:17.369 --> 35:20.435
- Who's the senior surgeon on call?
- What are you doing here?

35:20.665 --> 35:23.568
- I'm trying to help.
- We've got it. Take a break.

35:23.769 --> 35:28.046
Call the O.R.
They can explore this guy up there.

35:28.217 --> 35:30.006
- Get blood gas.
- Done!

35:30.201 --> 35:32.470
Get two units of O-neg
on the rapid infuser!

35:32.665 --> 35:36.178
- Get an H and H and cross for A.
- You want type-specific?

35:36.377 --> 35:38.265
- Good idea.
- It's ordered. Check the blood bank.

35:38.458 --> 35:39.668
- Portable chest?
- Ordered.

35:39.865 --> 35:42.932
- Doug, can you take over CPR?
- Yeah.

35:43.129 --> 35:46.096
Carol, call Radiology! Carol!

35:47.897 --> 35:50.996
- Carol!
- Let's go. I've got it.

35:54.361 --> 35:58.355
This is Hathaway in the ER.
I need a portable chest in Trauma 2.

35:59.001 --> 36:01.619
- Asystole!
- Let's crack him.

36:02.618 --> 36:04.887
Got it? Let's go.

36:06.265 --> 36:08.916
Get me a number 10 blade.

36:11.673 --> 36:12.917
Rib spreader.

36:15.802 --> 36:18.420
- Can you start internal compressions?
- Amp of epi!

36:18.617 --> 36:22.414
- Two more units of O-neg, Satinsky!
- Mg of atropine.

36:22.618 --> 36:24.144
Give me suction.

36:36.377 --> 36:38.744
Has anyone talked to Carol?
How is she doing?

36:38.938 --> 36:42.254
Not well from the looks of it.
She ain't giving up her job.

36:42.457 --> 36:45.305
- Is he gonna make it?
- Probably. It's just his spleen.

36:46.297 --> 36:48.086
- How many units?
- Four O-neg.

36:48.281 --> 36:50.703
- Last epi?
- Five mgs, 3 minutes ago. Total of 8.

36:50.937 --> 36:53.872
- How long has he been down?

37:01.209 --> 37:04.177
Time of death: 13:48.

37:21.145 --> 37:25.553
- Hey, Carol. How are you?
- Fine, Jerry. Thanks.

37:25.753 --> 37:29.430
- Where are the others?
- The lady with the hand's in 2.

37:29.626 --> 37:32.942
- The rest got transferred.
- Little boy, Robert, 10 years old?

37:33.177 --> 37:35.381
- I didn't hear anything about him.
- Thanks, Jer.

37:35.545 --> 37:38.294
You have a partial thickness
of second-degree burns.

37:38.457 --> 37:42.516
I'll get some Thermazine
salve and dressings.

37:43.833 --> 37:46.484
Hey! You're okay now.

37:48.153 --> 37:51.983
- You're okay.
- Yeah, I guess so.

37:52.217 --> 37:55.894
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

37:56.089 --> 38:00.312
- How are the others?
- That bread guy, Lockhart, was fine.

38:00.473 --> 38:03.702
Javier and Mr. Duzak
went to some other hospital.

38:03.930 --> 38:06.101
- And Robert?
- Robert...

38:07.033 --> 38:11.670
He crawled back down the hole
he crawled up in. Not a scratch.

38:11.833 --> 38:14.353
I didn't think I'd be this shaken.

38:18.457 --> 38:22.319
- We got out all right, huh?
- Yeah.

38:25.529 --> 38:29.490
I'll just put some cream and dressings
on your burns, and you'll be fine.

38:29.721 --> 38:31.543
Okay. Hey!

38:32.730 --> 38:37.367
You really saved our lives in there.
None of us could have done that.

38:39.257 --> 38:41.297
I'll see you around.

38:51.834 --> 38:55.412
- Are you all right?
- It's been a busy day, but...

38:55.609 --> 38:59.406
- Hey, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

39:02.490 --> 39:08.206
When we first heard you were in there,
we didn't know what was happening.

39:08.441 --> 39:10.830
Are you sure you're okay?

39:12.346 --> 39:13.752
Okay.

39:15.161 --> 39:18.838
Doug, I'm sorry about
what happened in there.

39:19.033 --> 39:20.942
- I didn't mean it.
- It doesn't matter.

39:21.145 --> 39:23.665
I'm just glad you're okay.

40:45.049 --> 40:48.049
Jerry, could you take this?

40:55.641 --> 40:57.877
Carol!

40:59.705 --> 41:03.415
- Do you need anything?
- No, thanks. I'm fine.

41:04.473 --> 41:07.190
We've missed you around here.

41:09.913 --> 41:12.696
I've missed it too.

41:12.889 --> 41:16.151
- I love my job, Kerry.
- I know.

41:19.865 --> 41:23.214
- I'm going home.
- Good idea.
