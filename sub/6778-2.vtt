01:46.140 --> 01:47.767
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
THEY WANT TH ESE FILLED

01:47.870 --> 01:48.894
WITH FUCKIN' HELIUM.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.900
IT'S THE A.V.N.
AWARDS, MAN,

01:51.010 --> 01:53.069
IT'S LIKE THE FUCKING
OSCARS OF PORN,

01:53.180 --> 01:55.034
AND THEY WANT 'EM
FLOATING FROM THE RAFI'ERS.

01:55.140 --> 01:57.005
CHECK THIS OUT...

01:57.110 --> 02:01.740
( in high pitched voice )
FUCK ME, I HAVE SEVERAL
FUCKABLE ORIFICES !

02:01.850 --> 02:03.738
( laughing )

02:03.850 --> 02:05.317
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

02:10.560 --> 02:13.393
( in high pitched voice )
NO, FUCK ME,
I'M A CHICK WITH A DICK !

02:13.500 --> 02:16.799
THEN YOU CAN
FUCK YOURSELF !

02:19.870 --> 02:23.465
OH SHIT,
MY DICK FELL OFF !

02:24.970 --> 02:26.437
HOLY SHIT.

02:26.540 --> 02:28.076
I THINK THIS
CHICK'S MY COUSIN.

02:28.180 --> 02:30.899
WATCH OUT !

02:31.010 --> 02:32.238
( brakes squealing )

02:32.350 --> 02:33.772
( passenger)
DUDE, YOU ALMOST
HIT THAT GUY.

02:33.880 --> 02:34.812
( driver )
I DID NOT.

02:34.920 --> 02:35.875
YES, YOU DID.

02:35.980 --> 02:37.413
WELL, HE LIKE
CAME FROM NOWHERE.

02:37.520 --> 02:38.942
( male on radio )
_ But it's not
Just the Wives

02:39.050 --> 02:40.654
who need to give themselves
freely to their husbands

02:40.760 --> 02:44.218
within the blessed confines
of the marriage bed...

02:44.330 --> 02:46.548
husbands need to surrender
as well, because--

02:46.660 --> 02:47.820
PRAISE THE LORD.

02:47.930 --> 02:49.227
( female on radio )
Because _women
have deSIres too.

02:49.330 --> 02:51.469
And those wifely desires
are meant by God

02:51.570 --> 02:53.162
to be satisfied
by their husbands.

02:53.270 --> 02:55.135
Even when we may not
feel like it--

02:55.240 --> 02:56.901
Right, Lonnie,
like that ever happens !

02:57.010 --> 02:58.159
So, this is how...

02:58.270 --> 02:59.999
this is how,
through marriage,

03:00.110 --> 03:01.839
we create the Garden
Of Eden again...

03:01.940 --> 03:04.249
without shame,
without sin.

03:04.350 --> 03:06.671
OH, OH, MY LORD... !

03:06.780 --> 03:09.783
OH, MY LORD !

03:09.890 --> 03:10.709
SWEET JESUS !

03:10.820 --> 03:11.946
SWEET JESUS !

03:12.050 --> 03:13.483
OH, SWEET JESUS !

03:13.590 --> 03:14.909
I'M COMING--

03:15.020 --> 03:16.920
( loud thump )

03:27.070 --> 03:30.301
OOOH...

03:30.410 --> 03:33.709
OH, THOSE ARE GOOD.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.973
YOU'RE UP EARLY.

03:37.080 --> 03:38.377
I'M ALWAYS UP EARLY.

03:38.480 --> 03:40.914
EVERY DAY'S
A NEW ADVENTURE.

03:41.020 --> 03:42.715
TODAY WE'RE
HAVING EGGS.

03:42.820 --> 03:45.015
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF OUR NEW TABLE ?

03:45.120 --> 03:47.918
I DON'T KNOW,
WHAT IS IT, INDIAN ?

03:48.020 --> 03:49.920
PERSIAN, I THINK.

03:50.030 --> 03:50.780
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE ?

03:50.890 --> 03:52.152
PERSIA IS IRAN.

03:52.260 --> 03:54.296
AND INDIA IS,
WELL, INDIA.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.618
IT'S GEORGE'S ?

03:56.730 --> 03:59.198
WELL, WE'VE BEEN MARRIED
FOR ALMOST THREE MONTHS,

03:59.300 --> 04:00.699
AND WE DECIDED IT
MIGHT BE TIME TO MOVE

04:00.800 --> 04:02.358
SOME OF HIS THINGS
OUT OF STORAGE.

04:02.470 --> 04:04.358
MOST OF IT'S
IN THE GARAGE FOR NOW,

04:04.470 --> 04:07.268
BUT WE PUT THE TABLE
IN LAST NIGHT BEFORE
WE WENT TO BED.

04:07.380 --> 04:08.870
YOU SEE THIS ?

04:10.150 --> 04:11.947
THIS IS CALLED
A HORSE !

04:12.050 --> 04:13.449
THAT'S FUNNY.

04:13.550 --> 04:15.040
WHERE DADDY COMES FROM,
IT'S CALLED A ROCK.

04:15.150 --> 04:16.981
IT'S A PIECE
OF GRAYWACKE,

04:17.090 --> 04:20.309
I FOUND PERCHED BETWEEN THE
WALLS OF THE SAN ANDREAS FAULT,

04:20.420 --> 04:21.409
UP NEAR PESCADERO.

04:21.520 --> 04:23.021
THAT'S WHAT
A "HORSE" IS.

04:23.130 --> 04:25.086
A PIECE OF
DISPLACED ROCK

04:25.190 --> 04:27.055
BETWEEN THE WALLS
OF A FAULT-LINE.

04:27.160 --> 04:28.354
THAT'S VERY HELPFUL,
GEORGE, THANK YOU.

04:28.460 --> 04:30.223
HOW'S OUR
LI'I'I'LE GIRL TODAY ?

04:30.330 --> 04:31.297
GOOD.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.129
EATING SOME EGGS,
WEARING SOME.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.969
IS THIS
A NEW TABLE ?

04:35.070 --> 04:36.765
IT'S PERSIAN.

04:36.870 --> 04:38.098
PERSIA ?

04:38.210 --> 04:39.802
DOES THAT
EXIST ANYMORE ?

04:39.910 --> 04:41.104
PERSIA IS IRAN.

04:41.210 --> 04:43.303
AND THIS IS
A "HORSE."

04:43.410 --> 04:45.901
A PIECE OF A ROCK FOUND
BETWEEN THE WALLS OF A FAULT ?

04:46.010 --> 04:47.819
VERY GOOD, CLAIRE.

04:47.920 --> 04:50.639
GEORGE HAS BEEN TELLING ME
ALL ABOUT HIS ROCKS.

04:50.750 --> 04:53.253
WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT
THEY COULD BE SO FASCINATING.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.316
AREN'T THEY ?

04:55.420 --> 04:57.422
IT'S LIKE GOING TO SCHOOL
IN YOUR OWN HOME.

04:57.530 --> 04:59.054
YOU KNOW, CLAIRE,

04:59.160 --> 05:01.754
MAYBE YOU COULD TAKE PHOTOS
OF SOME OF GEORGE'S KEEPSAKES.

05:01.860 --> 05:04.522
EVERY ONE OF THEM HAS SUCH
AN INTERESTING STORY BEHIND IT.

05:04.630 --> 05:06.461
WELL, NOT
ALL OF THEM.

05:06.570 --> 05:08.959
I MEAN, IT'S BEEN A WHILE
SINCE YOU DID ANY OF YOUR...

05:09.070 --> 05:10.708
YOU KNOW, ART.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.539
I JUST THOUGHT
IT MIGHT INSPIRE YOU.

05:12.640 --> 05:14.870
DO I LOOK LIKE
I NEED TO BE INSPIRED ?

05:14.980 --> 05:17.039
ACTUALLY, YOU DO.

05:19.150 --> 05:20.139
OH.

05:20.250 --> 05:21.444
I'M SORRY.

05:21.550 --> 05:22.949
DON'T BE SILLY,
ARTHUR.

05:23.050 --> 05:26.952
I'LL JUST GRAB MY CO'I'I'AGE CHEESE
AND TAKE IT UP TO MY ROOM.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.297
IS THIS PERSIAN ?

05:34.400 --> 05:36.493
YES, IT IS.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.465
I'M NOT SURE IF IT WORKS
IN THIS KITCHEN,

05:38.570 --> 05:40.595
BUT IT'S
VERY BEAUTIFUL.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.331
THANK YOU.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.103
I THINK IT WORKS
IN THIS KITCHEN.

05:50.210 --> 05:51.746
I LOVE IT,

05:51.850 --> 05:54.910
BECAUSE IT'S YOURS.

05:57.450 --> 06:00.283
APPARENTLY,
ACCORDING TO WITNESSES,

06:00.390 --> 06:02.529
SHE JUST GOT
OUT OF HER CAR

06:02.630 --> 06:04.825
AND RAN
INTO TRAFFIC.

06:04.930 --> 06:06.921
DO THEY KNOW WHY ?

06:08.630 --> 06:10.166
NO.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.488
I SUPPOSE
WE'LL NEVER KNOW.

06:14.500 --> 06:17.105
WELL, MY HEART
GOES OUT TO YOU.

06:18.810 --> 06:22.132
IT'S HORRIBLE,
NOT KNOWING EXACTLY

06:22.240 --> 06:24.845
WHAT HAPPENED
TO SOMEONE YOU LOVED.

06:24.950 --> 06:26.713
IT WAS HER TIME,

06:26.820 --> 06:28.344
THAT'S ALL.

06:28.450 --> 06:31.112
THE LORD WORKS
IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS.

06:33.220 --> 06:35.688
YES, HE CERTAINLY DOES.

06:35.790 --> 06:38.827
SO, MR. SHEEDY,
WOULD YOU PREFER

06:38.930 --> 06:40.158
AN AFTERNOON OR
AN EVENING VIEWING-- ?

06:40.260 --> 06:41.693
I'M SORRY,
I'M SORRY.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.018
I JUST THINK IN THE INTEREST
OF HEALTHY GRIEVING, MR. SHEEDY,

06:44.130 --> 06:46.496
YOU NEED TO GIVE YOURSELF
PERMISSION TO AT LEAST

06:46.600 --> 06:51.299
BE CURIOUS AS TO WHY YOUR WIFE
WOULD JUMP OUT OF HER CAR

06:51.410 --> 06:53.537
AND RUN INTO TRAFFIC...

06:53.640 --> 06:55.779
FOR NO APPARENT
REASON.

06:55.880 --> 06:57.142
WHY ?

06:57.250 --> 06:59.878
IT'S NOT GOING
TO BRING HER BACK.

06:59.980 --> 07:01.208
NATE ?

07:01.320 --> 07:04.585
I BELIEVE RICO COULD USE
YOUR ASSISTANCE DOWNSTAIRS.

07:06.820 --> 07:08.412
RIGHT.

07:13.700 --> 07:16.055
I'M VERY SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

07:37.690 --> 07:39.885
SOME OF THE MOST
STRIKING TAPESTRY ART

07:39.990 --> 07:42.185
OUT OF THE MEDIEVAL AGE IS
TO BE FOUND IN CENTRAL FRANCE

07:42.290 --> 07:45.020
IN THE CHATEAU
OF ANGERS.

07:45.130 --> 07:48.588
DURING THE 14th CENTURY,
A MORE "GOTHIC" STYLE

07:48.700 --> 07:50.497
WOULD TAKE ROOT
IN ENGLAND, HOWEVER,

07:50.600 --> 07:52.591
INTRODUCING INTRICATELY
CARVED WDEN SCULPTURE...

07:52.700 --> 07:55.032
HEY, YOU'RE
CLAIRE FISHER, RIGHT ?

07:55.140 --> 07:56.835
I LOVED THAT GRAVEYARD
LIGHT-BOX PIECE

07:56.940 --> 07:58.737
YOU HAD
IN THE ALUMNI SHOW.

07:58.840 --> 08:01.035
OH, THANKS.

08:01.140 --> 08:02.539
I'M ANITA MILLER.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.049
I STARTED WINTER
SEMESTER LAST YEAR.

08:04.150 --> 08:07.017
COOL, HI.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.053
( sighing )

08:13.160 --> 08:15.287
OH GOD, HOW MUCH OF THIS
GOTHIC STUFF CAN THERE BE ?

08:15.390 --> 08:16.823
SOME OF IT'S
REALLY BEAUTIFUL,

08:16.930 --> 08:18.784
BUT IT'S ALL STARTING TO KIND
OF RUN TOGETHER IN MY HEAD.

08:18.890 --> 08:19.925
I HEAR THAT.

08:20.030 --> 08:21.622
IF I SEE ONE MORE
BLEEDING JESUS

08:21.730 --> 08:22.992
I THINK I'LL HURL.

08:23.100 --> 08:24.897
MAYBE IF YOU HURL
ON A BLEEDING JESUS

08:25.000 --> 08:26.729
YOU COULD GET INDEPENDENT
STUDY CREDIT, OR A GRANT.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.832
YEAH, I'M SURE
THE N.E.A. IS JUST DYING

08:29.940 --> 08:31.703
TO HAND OUT MONEY
TO CHRIST-DEFACERS.

08:31.810 --> 08:33.801
THE N.E.A. IS DYING,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

08:33.910 --> 08:37.107
SO, ARE YOU WORKING
ON ANYTHING ?

08:37.210 --> 08:39.349
NO.

08:39.450 --> 08:42.214
I HAVEN'T EVEN
PICKED UP MY CAMERA
SINCE LIKE LAST SPRING.

08:42.320 --> 08:44.788
YOU ?

08:44.890 --> 08:46.915
PLEASE, ALL I DID
WAS WORK AT STARBUCKS

08:47.020 --> 08:48.885
AND SEE LAME-ASS MOVIES
LIKE "THE HULK."

08:48.990 --> 08:51.254
OH GOD, WHEN I SAW THAT
I WAS JUST LIKE,

08:51.360 --> 08:52.850
EXCUSE ME,
CAN SOMEBODY PLEASE

08:52.960 --> 08:55.053
EXPLAIN THOSE GIGUNDA,
PURPLE FUCKING PANTS ?

08:55.160 --> 08:56.491
I KNOW !

08:56.600 --> 08:58.124
JUST SHOW US HIS BIG,
GREEN PACKAGE ALREADY !

08:58.230 --> 08:59.936
( laughing )

09:00.040 --> 09:01.359
SHHH !

09:01.470 --> 09:04.109
CAN I HELP YOU ?

09:07.810 --> 09:10.108
HEY, YOU WANNA
GO OUT TOMORROW NIGHT ?

09:10.210 --> 09:11.848
IT'S OPEN MIKE NIGHT
AT THE NUTS AND JOLTS

09:11.950 --> 09:13.941
AND MY FRIEND EDIE
IS DOING HER THING.

09:14.050 --> 09:15.972
WHAT'S "HER THING" ?

09:16.080 --> 09:18.014
MMM, IT'S KIND OF A

09:18.120 --> 09:21.749
PUNK/ FOLK/ POETRY/ PERFORMANCE ART
KIND OF THING.

09:22.420 --> 09:24.229
SURE, WHY NOT ?

09:29.700 --> 09:31.327
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU CAN'T SEE THIS.

09:31.430 --> 09:32.863
HE'S JUST USING THAT

09:32.970 --> 09:33.994
"HAPPY SHE'S ON HER WAY
TO JESUS" HORSESHIT

09:34.100 --> 09:35.362
TO DISTANCE HIMSELF
FROM THE TRUTH.

09:35.470 --> 09:36.960
THE MAN LOST
HIS WIFE.

09:37.070 --> 09:40.369
HE'S FACING ONE
OF THE WORST THINGS

09:40.480 --> 09:41.879
THAT CAN POSSIBLY
HAPPEN TO A PERSON

09:41.980 --> 09:43.345
AND I JUST THINK
THAT HE NEEDS TO FEEL.

09:43.450 --> 09:47.841
HE NEEDS TO REALLY, REALLY
FEEL THE LOSS AND THE RAGE.

09:47.950 --> 09:50.646
NATE, EVERYONE HANDLES
THEIR GRIEF IN A DIFFERENT WAY.

09:50.750 --> 09:52.445
HE WAS NOWHERE EVEN
NEAR ACTUAL GRIEF.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.313
MAYBE HE'S JUST TRYING
TO KEEP IT TOGETHER

09:54.420 --> 09:55.785
IN FRONT OF HIS SON.

09:55.890 --> 09:57.050
YEAH, WOULDN'T WANT THE KID
TO BUMP UP AGAINST REALITY.

09:57.160 --> 09:58.525
WOULDN'T WANT TO PREPARE
HIM FOR ACTUAL LIFE.

09:58.630 --> 10:00.188
MAYBE THE MAN
HAS FAITH.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.392
IN WHAT, GOD ?

10:01.500 --> 10:02.865
YES, IN GOD.

10:02.970 --> 10:05.393
AND MAYBE HIS FAITH IN GOD
IS WHAT SUSTAINS HIM.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.229
WELL, HE'S NOT
"SUSTAINED."

10:07.340 --> 10:10.264
HE TOTALLY
FUCKING CHECKED OUT.

10:10.370 --> 10:14.431
YOU GOTTA GO THROUGH ALL
THE NECESSARY STAGES OF GRIEF !

10:14.540 --> 10:17.805
THAT'S HOW YOU
HONOR WHAT THE PERSON
ACTUALLY MEANT TO YOU.

10:28.990 --> 10:31.550
HOW LONG WERE YOU
WITH THE L.A.P.D. ?

10:31.660 --> 10:33.855
ALMOST SIX YEARS.

10:33.960 --> 10:36.497
AND WHY DID
YOU LEAVE ?

10:36.600 --> 10:38.568
I, UH...

10:38.670 --> 10:41.468
I WENT OFF ON A GUY
DURING A DOMESTIC ABUSE CALL.

10:41.570 --> 10:43.333
DID YOU
KILL THE GUY ?

10:43.440 --> 10:44.759
NO.

10:44.870 --> 10:46.735
I BUSTED HIM UP
PRETI'Y BAD, THOUGH.

10:46.840 --> 10:48.603
DID EVER KILL ANYBODY
IN THE LINE OF DUTY ?

10:48.710 --> 10:51.099
ONCE.

10:51.210 --> 10:54.338
A GUY PULLED A GUN
AND I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.

10:54.450 --> 10:55.940
IT WAS A
CLEAN SHOOTING.

10:56.050 --> 10:58.416
I KILLED A GUY DURING
A DOMESTIC ABUSE CALL ONCE.

10:58.520 --> 10:59.544
MIKE...

10:59.650 --> 11:01.686
NOW'S NOT THE TIME.

11:01.790 --> 11:04.918
LOOK, PU'I'I'ING SOME
ASSHOLE IN THE HOSPITAL

11:05.030 --> 11:06.952
FOR BEATING UP ON HIS WIFE
IS NOT A PROBLEM.

11:07.060 --> 11:10.097
WE HANDLE STRICTLY
HIGH-END CLIENTELE,

MOSTLY HIGH-PROFILE

THREE M.J.'S THEN.

11:28.520 --> 11:29.919
WOW.

11:30.020 --> 11:31.942
WHEN YOU COME TO WORK FOR
SAFEGUARD PROTECTION AGENCY,

11:32.050 --> 11:34.314
YOUR JOB IS NOT TO PUT
YOUR HANDS ON ANYONE

11:34.420 --> 11:35.956
DURING ANY
GIVEN SITUATION.

11:36.060 --> 11:38.756
YOUR JOB IS
TO "LOW-TONE" IT

11:38.860 --> 11:41.658
AND DEFUSE THE SITUATION
BEFORE IT BECOMES A SITUATION.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.921
GOT IT.

11:44.030 --> 11:46.669
I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANYMORE
QUESTIONS FOR NOW, MR. CHARLES.

11:46.770 --> 11:48.635
ME NEITHER.

11:48.740 --> 11:51.629
DO YOU HAVE ANY
QUESTIONS FOR US ?

11:51.740 --> 11:53.731
NO, I DON'T
THINK SO.

11:53.840 --> 11:56.877
I REALLY WOULD LIKE
THIS JOB, THOUGH.

11:56.980 --> 11:59.574
I MEAN, THIS IS EXACTLY
THE LINE OF WORK

11:59.680 --> 12:01.671
THAT I'D LIKE
TO GET INTO.

12:01.780 --> 12:06.911
I'M A HARD WORKER AND,
UM, YOU WON'T BE SORRY.

12:09.190 --> 12:11.124
WE'LL CALL YOU.

12:13.160 --> 12:14.195
OKAY.

12:14.300 --> 12:15.221
OH.

12:15.330 --> 12:17.469
OH SHIT.

12:17.570 --> 12:18.696
DO YOU HAVE
ANY PAPER TOWELS ?

12:18.800 --> 12:20.131
WE'LL TAKE
CARE OF IT.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.093
MIKE ?

12:21.200 --> 12:23.134
I'M ON IT.

12:23.240 --> 12:25.003
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.809
( knocking )

12:34.020 --> 12:37.410
OH, THANK YOU
SO MUCH, RICO.

12:39.120 --> 12:40.815
COME IN.

12:40.920 --> 12:43.286
HI, NICOLE.

12:43.390 --> 12:45.824
HEY SWEETIE.

12:45.930 --> 12:51.163
I AM SO GLAD
THAT I MET YOU.

12:52.130 --> 12:55.190
I NEVER HAD SOMEONE
BE SO NICE TO ME

12:55.300 --> 12:57.609
WITHOUT EXPECTING SOMETHING
IN RETURN, YOU KNOW ?

12:57.710 --> 12:58.961
YEAH.

12:59.070 --> 13:01.538
EXCEPT FOR
THAT ONE TIME...

13:01.640 --> 13:03.176
WHICH I DIDN'T
MIND AT ALL.

13:03.280 --> 13:04.599
LOOK, SOPHIA.

13:04.710 --> 13:06.371
I'M MARRIED.

13:06.480 --> 13:09.176
WE BOTH KNOW IT,

13:09.280 --> 13:10.781
I'M JUST TRYING
TO HELP OUT A LITTLE

13:10.890 --> 13:11.982
HERE AND THERE,
THAT'S ALL.

13:12.090 --> 13:13.409
CAN YOU DO ME
A HUGE FAVOR ?

13:13.520 --> 13:14.919
YOU KNOW THE DVD PLAYER
THAT YOU BROUGHT ME LAST WEEK,

13:15.020 --> 13:17.853
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO HOOK IT UP.

13:19.190 --> 13:21.124
SURE.

13:21.230 --> 13:22.720
YEAH.

13:22.830 --> 13:24.627
ALRIGHT.

13:24.730 --> 13:27.233
HEY, SWEETIE.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.558
NOW YOU'LL BE ABLE TO WATCH
ALL YOUR FAVORITE MOVIES, HUH ?

13:29.670 --> 13:32.969
YOO-HOO.

13:38.180 --> 13:39.579
SO, YOU GOING
TO WORK ?

13:39.680 --> 13:41.113
YEAH.

13:43.690 --> 13:45.317
I WISH YOU
DIDN'T HAVE TO,

13:46.590 --> 13:49.218
YOU KNOW,
DO THAT FOR A LIVING.

13:49.320 --> 13:51.629
YEAH, WELL WE ALL
GOT TO EAT, RIGHT ?

13:51.730 --> 13:53.197
YEAH.

13:57.400 --> 13:58.924
WHO WATCHES NICOLE ?

13:59.030 --> 14:01.089
THE LADY UPSTAIRS.

14:02.100 --> 14:03.533
WHERE'S HER FATHER ?

14:04.510 --> 14:06.068
FUCK IF I KNOW.

14:06.170 --> 14:09.139
LOOK, RICO,
HE'S A SPEED FREAK
AND A DEADBEAT.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.208
WE'RE BE'I'I'ER OFF
WITHOUT HIM, BELIEVE ME.

14:11.310 --> 14:13.870
AND IF YOU COME
TO THE CLUB TONIGHT,

14:13.980 --> 14:15.572
DON'T CALL ME SOPHIA.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.216
MY CLUB NAME IS--

14:17.320 --> 14:18.389
INFINITY.

14:18.490 --> 14:20.355
INFINITY, I KNOW.

14:22.420 --> 14:26.254
ALRIGHT, LET'S GET
THIS THING HOOKED UP.

14:27.430 --> 14:28.522
WANT TO HELP ME ?

14:28.630 --> 14:30.063
I JUST FIGURED,

14:30.170 --> 14:31.421
NOBODY KNOWS MORE ABOUT
CRAZY PEOPLE THAN I DO.

14:31.530 --> 14:33.634
I WAS RAISED BY THEM,
I AM ONE OF THEM...

14:33.740 --> 14:35.958
AND REALLY, I'M WAY TOO OLD
TO BE RUBBING UP STRANGERS.

14:36.070 --> 14:38.459
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA MAKE
AN EXCELLENT THERAPIST.

14:38.570 --> 14:40.174
IT'S A PRETI'Y INTENSIVE,
FAST-TRACK PROGRAM,

14:40.280 --> 14:42.168
AND I'M GONNA HAVE TO WORK
MY LAZY ASS OFF, BUT...

14:42.280 --> 14:45.044
I'LL HAVE MY M.S.W.
SUMMER OF 2005.

14:45.150 --> 14:47.118
YOU CAN ANALYZE ME.

14:47.220 --> 14:51.008
MY MOTHER IS GOING TO FREAK
WHEN SHE FINDS OUT.

14:52.120 --> 14:54.281
I'LL JUST
NEVER TELL HER.

14:56.090 --> 14:58.627
SO, WHAT DAY IS THIS ?

14:58.730 --> 15:01.699
DAY 78, RIGHT ?

15:01.800 --> 15:03.620
MORE LIKE 67,
ACTUALLY.

15:03.730 --> 15:05.061
67?

15:05.170 --> 15:06.364
WHERE DO YOU
GET 67 ?

15:06.470 --> 15:08.335
THE TWO WEEKS YOU WERE
IN SAN JOSE DON'T COUNT.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.305
NO, THEY DON'T.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.207
WE DIDN'T EVEN TALK
DURING THOSE TWO WEEKS.

15:12.310 --> 15:13.902
YEAH, BUT WE FANTASIZED
ABOUT EACH OTHER.

15:14.010 --> 15:16.103
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.

15:16.210 --> 15:18.405
YOU DIDN'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT ME ?

15:18.510 --> 15:20.842
WHILE TOUCHING MYSELF ?

15:20.950 --> 15:23.043
I LOVE THE SOUND
OF THAT.

15:23.150 --> 15:25.186
YEAH, I BET YOU DO.

15:25.290 --> 15:29.954
I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR THAT
WE COUNT THE DAYS IN SAN JOSE.

15:31.090 --> 15:33.558
THINK OF IT AS TIME OFF
FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR.

15:35.430 --> 15:36.692
MAYBE.

15:39.170 --> 15:41.388
HERE, EAT THIS.

15:47.610 --> 15:49.532
( toilet flushing )

16:01.390 --> 16:03.688
SOME PEOPLE THINK
I'M IN HEAVEN.

16:03.790 --> 16:06.156
BUT GUESS WHAT ?

16:09.200 --> 16:11.498
THERE IS NO HEAVEN.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.761
EXCEPT RIGHT HERE...

16:13.870 --> 16:16.361
WITH YOU.

16:23.680 --> 16:26.945
"YEA, THOU I WALK THROUGH THE
VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH,

16:27.050 --> 16:31.248
"I WILL FEAR NO EVIL,
FOR THOU ART WITH ME.

16:31.350 --> 16:34.911
THY ROD AND THY STAFF,
THEY COMFORT ME..."

16:35.020 --> 16:37.250
OH YEAH !

16:37.360 --> 16:38.429
OH YES !

16:38.530 --> 16:40.259
OH YES !

16:40.360 --> 16:42.351
OH, OH !

16:55.240 --> 16:55.899
HEY.

16:56.010 --> 16:57.238
IS THIS TOO MUCH ?

16:57.350 --> 17:01.468
NO, SIR, YOU ARE ALL THAT
AND A BOX OF COOKIES.

17:02.250 --> 17:03.808
YOU HAVE TO
SAY THAT.

17:03.920 --> 17:05.615
YEAH, I KINDA DO.

17:05.720 --> 17:09.383
OH SHIT, I GO'I'I'A PICK UP
THAT PACKAGE IN 20 MINUTES.

17:09.490 --> 17:12.618
I CANNOT BELIEVE
YOU'RE GOING TO BE

17:12.730 --> 17:14.152
A SECURITY GUARD
TO THE STARS.

17:14.260 --> 17:15.852
SECURITY SPECIALIST.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.097
OH, THAT IS SO HOT.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.997
WHO ARE YOU
PROTECTING TODAY ?

17:19.100 --> 17:21.295
I HAVE NO IDEA.

17:21.400 --> 17:24.369
ALL I KNOW IS I HAVE TO BE
AT THE MERIDIEN HOTEL AT 11.

17:24.470 --> 17:25.903
I HOPE IT'S
RUSSELL CROWE.

17:26.010 --> 17:27.409
OR DENZEL WASHINGTON.

17:27.510 --> 17:29.933
OR RUSSELL CROWE
AND DENZEL WASHINGTON.

17:30.040 --> 17:33.510
MMM, IMAGINE
THE POSSIBILITIES.

17:38.990 --> 17:40.810
I NEED A NEW SUIT.

17:40.920 --> 17:42.353
YOU CAN BUY
THREE NEW SUITS

17:42.460 --> 17:44.189
WITH THE MONEY
YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE,

17:44.290 --> 17:46.224
MISTER THEY-START-ME-OUT-AT-
25-BUCKS-A-FUCKING-HOUR.

17:46.330 --> 17:48.821
SOME OF THESE GUYS MAKE
100 IF THEY GO ON TOUR.

17:48.930 --> 17:51.125
HOLY SHIT.

17:51.230 --> 17:53.232
WE CAN FINALLY GET ONE OF
THOSE GIGANTIC FLAT-SCREEN,

17:53.340 --> 17:55.160
HIGH-DEFINITION TVS
YOU'VE BEEN WANTING.

17:55.270 --> 17:57.636
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT ELSE ?

17:57.740 --> 17:59.264
A HOUSE.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.036
OH MY GOD,
WITH A SWIMMING POOL.

18:02.140 --> 18:03.676
AND A JACUZZI.

18:03.780 --> 18:06.908
AND AN O'KEEFE AND MERRI'I'I'
STOVE-AND-OVEN FOR THE KITCHEN.

18:07.010 --> 18:09.171
OH, PUT YOUR
HANDS ON ME.

18:10.250 --> 18:13.788
MY JOB IS TO NOT PUT
MY HANDS ON ANYBODY.

18:13.890 --> 18:15.152
OH.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.716
MY JOB IS
TO "LOW-TONE" IT,

18:16.820 --> 18:20.529
AND DEFUSE THE SITUATION
BEFORE IT BECOMES A SITUATION.

18:20.630 --> 18:21.756
OH, YEAH ?

18:21.860 --> 18:22.792
WELL, DEFUSE THIS.

18:22.900 --> 18:23.696
AH.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.222
MMM.

18:39.950 --> 18:42.145
KEITH, THIS IS
DEREK AND JEFFREY.

18:43.390 --> 18:44.414
HEY.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.883
WHAT'S UP ?

18:46.990 --> 18:48.855
YOU TAKE
A PEEK INSIDE ?

18:48.960 --> 18:49.688
EXCUSE ME ?

18:49.790 --> 18:50.779
INSIDE THE CASE.

18:50.890 --> 18:52.380
NO.

18:52.490 --> 18:54.094
YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME
THE COMBINATION.

18:54.200 --> 18:57.499
NOT THAT I WOULD
HAVE IF YOU HAD.

18:57.600 --> 19:00.239
DON'T YOU WANNA KNOW
WHAT YOU WERE TRANSPORTING ?

19:00.340 --> 19:02.296
NOT IF YOU
DON'T NEED ME TO.

19:08.880 --> 19:10.541
C.D.'S BLING.

19:11.680 --> 19:12.169
C.D. ?

19:12.280 --> 19:13.679
CAMERON DIAZ.

19:13.780 --> 19:16.340
WOW, I'M GOING
TO MEET CAMERON DIAZ ?

19:16.450 --> 19:17.849
NO.

19:17.950 --> 19:20.783
I'M PUTI'ING YOU ON LOBBY DUTY
WITH DEREK AND JEFFREY TONIGHT.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.683
OH, GOT IT.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.008
SO WHAT DO
WE DO NOW ?

19:38.110 --> 19:39.805
WE'RE DOIN' IT.

19:39.910 --> 19:41.935
YOU GOT
SOME SHADES ?

19:42.040 --> 19:44.372
I LEFI' THEM
IN THE CAR.

20:04.470 --> 20:07.962
I REALLY LIKE THIS
TABLE OF YOURS, GEORGE.

20:08.070 --> 20:11.608
ALTHOUGH, I MUST ADMIT I KIND OF
MISS THE OLD FORMICA ONE.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.930
I'M SURE BEING A GEOLOGIST
YOU KNOW FORMICA

20:16.040 --> 20:18.543
WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED
AS AN ELECTRICAL INSULATOR,

20:18.650 --> 20:23.519
CREATED AS A REPLACEMENT
FOR MICA, A SILICATE MINERAL.

20:23.620 --> 20:27.716
HENCE THE WORD
"FOR MICA."

20:29.260 --> 20:31.387
ACTUALLY,
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

20:31.490 --> 20:34.653
MICA, WHETHER BIOTITE
OR MUSCOVITE,

20:34.760 --> 20:36.421
IS A SILICATE MINERAL,
THAT'S TRUE.

20:36.530 --> 20:39.727
BUT FORMICA IS
A PLASTIC LAMINATE,

20:39.830 --> 20:43.903
DEVELOPED FOR KITCHEN
FURNISHINGS IN THE 19205.

20:44.010 --> 20:47.605
THE ONE HAS NOTHING WHATSOEVER
TO DO WITH THE OTHER.

20:55.150 --> 20:57.380
I STAND CORRECTED THEN.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.219
THEY'RE BOTH SUCH
INTERESTING EXPLANATIONS,

20:59.320 --> 21:01.288
THOUGH,
AREN'T THEY ?

21:04.860 --> 21:07.397
BY THE WAY, THAT'S
MY YOGURT YOU'RE EATING.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.367
MY NAME IS CLEARLY MARKED
ON THE SIDE OF THE CONTAINER.

21:10.470 --> 21:11.960
I HOPE YOU'RE
PLANNING ON REPLACING

21:12.070 --> 21:14.459
HOWEVER MUCH OF IT
YOU CONSUME.

21:19.870 --> 21:21.474
OH.

21:30.920 --> 21:32.512
MAN, I'D FUCK HER.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.911
ME, TOO.

21:40.860 --> 21:42.555
I'D TAP THAT ASS.

21:42.660 --> 21:43.661
OH, YEAH.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.328
NO FUCKIN' DOUBT.

21:48.240 --> 21:50.435
CHECK OUT THAT.

21:53.210 --> 21:54.871
YOU CAN'T
HAVE THAT.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.369
I COULD IF
I WANTED TO.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.243
IN YOUR DREAMS,
YOU COULD.

21:59.350 --> 22:03.639
I'VE HAD FINER
THAN THAT.

22:03.750 --> 22:04.978
UH-HUH.

22:05.090 --> 22:08.787
I'D DEFINITELY
TAP THAT...

22:10.020 --> 22:11.089
ASS.

22:25.570 --> 22:27.379
OKAY, I THINK YOU
SHOULD GO HOME.

22:27.480 --> 22:33.009
IT'S STILL EARLY,
THOUGH.

22:33.110 --> 22:34.008
I KNOW...

22:34.120 --> 22:35.747
I JUST WANT
SOME ALONE TIME.

22:35.850 --> 22:39.240
OKAY.

22:39.350 --> 22:40.658
SO...

22:40.760 --> 22:42.580
WHEN DO WE
STOP DOING THIS

22:42.690 --> 22:44.385
"GOING BACK TO OUR
RESPECTIVE PLACES ?"

22:44.490 --> 22:47.220
AT THE END
OF 90 DAYS.

22:47.330 --> 22:48.729
90 DAYS, RIGHT.

22:48.830 --> 22:51.094
IT'S A GOOD, HEALTHY PERIOD
OF REHABILITATION, THAT'S ALL.

22:51.200 --> 22:54.988
YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME PEOPLE
WHO GO TO REHAB FOR 30 DAYS.

22:55.100 --> 22:57.603
THOSE PEOPLE
USUALLY RELAPSE.

22:57.710 --> 23:00.429
WHAT ABOUT
THE 60-DAY PEOPLE ?

23:00.540 --> 23:02.735
STILL PRETI'Y "IFFY."

23:05.950 --> 23:06.803
OKAY.

23:06.910 --> 23:08.013
I SEE.

23:08.120 --> 23:09.747
SO...

23:09.850 --> 23:12.546
90 DAYS.

23:12.650 --> 23:15.312
IS IT THE MORNING
OF THE 90th DAY,

23:15.420 --> 23:17.217
OR THE EVENING
OF THE 90th DAY ?

23:17.320 --> 23:20.050
IT WOULD BE
THE 9lst, ACTUALLY.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.924
THAT IS SO
NOT FAIR.

23:23.030 --> 23:24.361
OH, COME ON.

23:24.470 --> 23:27.325
YOU'RE NOT 17,
YOU CAN WAIT.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.567
IT'LL BE WORTH IT,
TRUST ME.

23:29.670 --> 23:32.332
BUT I JUST WANT
TO SEE THAT WEIRD TA'I'I'OO.

23:32.440 --> 23:33.805
YOU'VE SEEN IT
ALREADY !

23:33.910 --> 23:37.505
WITHOUT ALL THAT ANNOYING
CLOTHING TO DISTRACT ME.

23:37.610 --> 23:41.216
JUST ONCE, I JUST WANT
TO GET TO KNOW SOMEONE

23:41.320 --> 23:43.538
BEFORE I SLEEP
WITH THEM.

23:45.720 --> 23:48.188
PEOPLE USED TO GET ENGAGED
BEFORE THEY'D EVEN MET,

23:48.290 --> 23:51.179
AND THEY'D STAY
ENGAGED FOR YEARS

23:51.290 --> 23:52.780
WHILE THEY GOT
TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

23:52.890 --> 23:54.357
YEAH, PEOPLE ALSO
USED TO THINK TH CATS

23:54.460 --> 23:56.655
COULD SUCK THEIR SOULS
OUT OF THEIR BODIES.

23:56.760 --> 23:58.125
THEY DO.

23:58.230 --> 24:02.496
YOU KNOW, TECHNICALLY,

24:02.600 --> 24:07.105
I COULD STAY OVER
BEFORE THE 90 DAYS.

24:07.210 --> 24:10.099
WE WOULD JUST HAVE TO SORT
OF KEEP A LID ON IT.

24:10.210 --> 24:13.043
I DON'T THINK
I COULD DO THAT.

24:18.850 --> 24:20.078
OH.

24:20.790 --> 24:22.519
OKAY.

24:28.800 --> 24:31.018
I'M GONNA GO ACROSS
THE COURTYARD,

24:31.130 --> 24:34.167
AND I'M GONNA COUNT TO 91
AND I'M GONNA MASTURBATE.

24:38.710 --> 24:42.407
( radio playing )

24:42.510 --> 24:43.647
YOU WANT MORE
PIZZA, BABE ?

24:43.750 --> 24:44.739
YOU BARELY
ATE A THING.

24:44.850 --> 24:48.308
OH NO, I HAD
TWO PIECES, I'M FULL.

24:48.420 --> 24:50.513
USUALLY YOU EAT
THE WHOLE PIZZA YOURSELF.

24:50.620 --> 24:52.508
ARE YOU FEELING OKAY ?

24:53.350 --> 24:54.681
YEAH, I FEEL FINE.

24:55.790 --> 24:58.054
CAN I GET
SOME MORE TOKENS ?

24:59.990 --> 25:02.049
KEEPING AN EYE
ON YOUR BROTHER OVER THERE ?

25:02.160 --> 25:03.092
YES.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.189
HUH ?

25:04.300 --> 25:05.289
HERE.

25:05.400 --> 25:07.061
ONE FOR YOU,
ONE FOR HIM.

25:10.170 --> 25:11.808
HOW WAS WORK ?

25:12.810 --> 25:14.903
SAME SHIT,
DIFFERENT DAY.

25:16.680 --> 25:19.046
YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK
TO ME ABOUT ANYTHING ?

25:20.650 --> 25:22.311
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR DAY ?

25:22.420 --> 25:23.580
I ALREADY DID,

25:23.690 --> 25:25.282
BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU
WEREN'T LISTENING.

25:25.390 --> 25:26.414
I WAS LISTENING.

25:26.520 --> 25:28.056
WHAT'D I SAY ?

25:32.590 --> 25:33.898
LOOK, VANESSA.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.457
I'M JUST A LITTLE DISTRACT ED
RIGHT NOW, THAT'S ALL.

25:36.560 --> 25:38.425
THIS IS SHAKEY'S
PIZZA NIGHT, BABE,

25:38.530 --> 25:40.122
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE FUN.

25:40.230 --> 25:41.492
THE KIDS ARE
HAVING A BLAST.

25:41.600 --> 25:42.999
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

25:43.100 --> 25:45.136
NO, IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE FUN FOR ALL OF US.

25:45.240 --> 25:46.309
I'M HAVING FUN.

25:46.410 --> 25:47.775
YOU ARE A LYING
SACK OF SHIT.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.507
HEY, YOU DIDN'T HAVE MUCH OF
ANYTHING TO TALK TO ME ABOUT

25:49.610 --> 25:50.907
FOR SIX FUCKING MONTHS.

25:51.010 --> 25:53.240
CAN'T I BE DISTRACT ED
FOR ONE NIGHT ?

25:59.820 --> 26:04.621
YOUR CLITORIS HOT,
BURNING, WET PINKNESS

26:04.730 --> 26:08.757
I WASN'T THE FIRST
AND I WON'T BE THE LAST.

26:08.860 --> 26:12.296
THE CRACK OF THE WORLD
FOR ALL TO EXPLORE,

26:12.400 --> 26:13.731
EXCEPT FOR ME.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.831
BEEN THERE, DONE THAT.

26:18.540 --> 26:20.303
THAT'S THE END.

26:20.410 --> 26:21.934
THANK YOU.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.270
( applause )

26:26.110 --> 26:27.475
I FEEL VIOLATED.

26:27.580 --> 26:30.014
I DON'T THINK
HE'S EVER BEEN LAID.

26:30.120 --> 26:31.712
OH, THAT'S EDIE !

26:34.990 --> 26:36.014
OKAY...

26:36.120 --> 26:39.578
CAN WE MAKE A RULE
FOR OPEN MIKE NIGHT ?

26:39.690 --> 26:41.055
NO MORE ANGRY
POEMS OR SONGS

26:41.160 --> 26:44.027
WITH CLITORAL OR
VAGINAL REFERENCES IN THEM...

26:44.130 --> 26:46.894
UNLESS YOU HAVE ONE.

26:47.000 --> 26:49.730
( laughing )

26:49.840 --> 26:53.776
HERE'S MY POEM DEDICATED TO
EVERY GUY I'VE EVER BEEN WITH:

26:53.880 --> 26:58.271
YOUR PENIS
IS KINDA NICE

26:58.380 --> 27:01.918
TOO BAD YOU'RE
ATTACHED TO IT.

27:02.020 --> 27:03.908
( laughing )

27:04.020 --> 27:06.215
THIS NEXT PIECE
IS A COLLABORATION

27:06.320 --> 27:09.084
BETWEEN ME AND MY MOM,
WHO LIVES IN CHICAGO.

27:20.740 --> 27:23.709
EVEN THOUGH SHE'S BEEN
SMOKING THREE PACKS A DAY

27:23.810 --> 27:25.459
FOR 40 YEARS.

27:25.570 --> 27:26.901
( female voice )
Edie... ?

27:27.010 --> 27:29.001
FEEL SORRY
FOR HER YET ?

27:31.350 --> 27:34.547
I just came back from lunch
with your Aunt Betty.

27:34.650 --> 27:38.188
AUNT BETTY WHO ONCE
TOLD ME BLACK PEOPLE

27:38.290 --> 27:40.212
COULDN'T GO TO HEAVEN.

27:42.360 --> 27:44.624
I feel so lost,

27:44.730 --> 27:47.949
I don't know what
to do with myself...

27:50.900 --> 27:53.528
OKAY, I LIED ABOUT
THE CANCER PART.

27:53.630 --> 27:56.235
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG
WITH THIS WOMAN.

27:56.340 --> 27:57.705
NOTHING !

27:57.810 --> 27:59.630
What happened
to me, Edie ?

27:59.740 --> 28:01.537
What happened
to my life ?

28:01.640 --> 28:02.834
SHE'S JUST
A FUCKING VICTIM,

28:02.940 --> 28:04.703
WHO'S NEVER TAKEN
A CHANCE IN HER LIFE

28:04.810 --> 28:06.368
AND HAS NOBODY
TO BLAME BUT HERSELF !

28:08.280 --> 28:11.113
I wish I was dead.

28:11.220 --> 28:13.609
ACTUALLY, MY MOM
IS THE VICE PRESIDENT

28:13.720 --> 28:16.587
OF THE MIDWESTERN
DIRECT MARKETING ASSOCIATION.

28:16.690 --> 28:19.181
I can get any
targeted list you want.

28:19.290 --> 28:24.262
Over 65, under 21, married,
single, gay, lesbian, smokers,

28:24.370 --> 28:25.792
racists,
cancer survivors.

28:25.900 --> 28:27.788
SHE IS PLUNGING
HEADLONG INTO THE ABYSS

28:27.900 --> 28:29.561
WITH ALL HER GUNS FIRING !

28:29.670 --> 28:31.706
You just tell me
what you want and...

28:31.810 --> 28:33.869
I will deliver !

28:33.980 --> 28:37.279
AND IT WILL TAKE YOU 32 HOURS
OF SHEER PHYSICAL AGONY

28:37.380 --> 28:40.008
AND YOU WILL NEVER
LET ME FORGET ABOUT IT !

28:41.380 --> 28:43.314
Edie...

28:43.420 --> 28:46.981
( chatter)

29:08.980 --> 29:11.471
YOU MADE HER
LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL.

29:13.250 --> 29:14.478
WELL...

29:14.580 --> 29:16.218
YOU AND GOD.

29:17.580 --> 29:19.184
THAT'S OUR JOB.

29:20.820 --> 29:23.209
ME AND MY ASSOCIATES,
I MEAN.

29:23.320 --> 29:25.049
NOT ME AND GOD.

29:27.930 --> 29:29.522
SO, HOW ARE YOU
HOLDING UP ?

29:29.630 --> 29:31.791
QUITE WELL.

29:31.900 --> 29:33.094
THANK YOU
FOR ASKING.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.361
IT'S OKAY FOR YOU
TO BE ANGRY.

29:35.470 --> 29:36.562
I'M NOT ANGRY.

29:36.670 --> 29:39.833
MAYBE YOU JUST
DON'T REALIZE IT.

29:39.940 --> 29:41.373
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW
ANGER IS A VERY NATURAL

29:41.480 --> 29:43.334
AND NECESSARY STAGE
IN THE GRIEVING PROCESS.

29:43.440 --> 29:44.543
NATE--

29:44.650 --> 29:45.548
AND YOU CAN'T
JUST SKIP OVER IT.

29:45.650 --> 29:46.799
BELIEVE ME,
I'VE BEEN THERE.

29:46.910 --> 29:48.116
YOU HAVE
TO LIVE WITH IT

29:48.220 --> 29:50.438
AND ALLOW YOURSELF
TO DWELL ON IT.

29:50.550 --> 29:51.983
YOU HAVE TO OWN IT,

29:52.090 --> 29:53.682
ONLY THEN ARE YOU GONNA HAVE
ANY CHANCE OF MOVING THROUGH IT,

29:53.790 --> 29:55.417
AND GETTING ON WITH
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

29:55.520 --> 29:59.058
I KNOW THERE'S A REASON
GOD CHOSE THIS FOR DOROTHY

29:59.160 --> 30:02.459
AND I KNOW THAT
HIS WISDOM IS INFINITE.

30:02.560 --> 30:04.460
BUT WHAT IF
YOU'RE WRONG ?

30:04.570 --> 30:06.128
I'M NOT.

30:06.230 --> 30:09.461
BUT WHAT IF THERE'S
NO GOD, NO HEAVEN ?

30:09.570 --> 30:10.696
NATE--

30:10.800 --> 30:11.960
WHAT IF SHE'S
JUST GONE, FOREVER,

30:12.070 --> 30:13.560
LIKE SHE DIDN'T
EVEN EXIST,

30:13.670 --> 30:15.535
AND NOW YOU HAVE A CHILD
WHO WILL NEVER KNOW HIS MOTHER,

30:15.640 --> 30:16.675
THAT DOESN'T
MAKE YOU ANGRY ?

30:16.780 --> 30:17.678
NATE !

30:17.780 --> 30:18.804
IT'S ALRIGHT.

30:18.910 --> 30:20.138
NO, IT'S NOT.

30:20.250 --> 30:22.377
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US
FOR A MOMENT...

30:23.150 --> 30:24.412
PLEASE.

30:29.490 --> 30:30.809
THAT'S ENOUGH.

30:30.930 --> 30:32.283
I AM JUST TRYING TO HELP
THE GUY FACE UP TO THE TRUTH.

30:33.460 --> 30:35.394
I'M UNIQUELY QUALIFIED,
DON'T YOU THINK ?

30:35.500 --> 30:37.422
I'M A FUNERAL DIRECTOR AND
MY WIFE IS FRESHLY FUCKIN' DEAD,

30:37.530 --> 30:39.020
WHO'S MORE
QUALIFIED THAN ME ?

30:39.130 --> 30:40.199
THIS ISN'T
ABOUT YOU, OKAY ?!

30:40.300 --> 30:42.097
LEAVE THESE
PEOPLE ALONE.

30:42.200 --> 30:43.792
LOOK, YOU WANT
TO LEAVE THEM ALONE ?

30:43.910 --> 30:45.036
FINE, YOU LEAVE
THEM ALONE,

30:45.140 --> 30:46.368
BUT DON'T EXPECT ME
TO FEED THEM LAME SHIT

30:46.470 --> 30:48.028
LIKE IT'S GOING TO GET BETTER,
BECAUSE IT WON'T !

30:48.140 --> 30:50.074
AND PEOPLE NEED
TO KNOW THAT !

30:52.180 --> 30:54.614
WELL, MAYBE SOME PEOPLE
AREN'T READY FOR THAT.

31:00.790 --> 31:02.382
"FORMICA.

31:02.490 --> 31:07.029
"A DURABLE PLASTIC LAMINATE
USED IN KITCHEN FURNISHINGS...

31:07.130 --> 31:10.349
"DEVELOPED AS AN
ELECTRICAL INSULATOR

31:10.460 --> 31:13.361
"AS A REPLACEMENT FOR
THE SILICATE MINERAL...

31:14.440 --> 31:15.998
MICA."

31:18.840 --> 31:21.035
THAT WAS SO GREAT.

31:21.140 --> 31:22.676
NO, IT WAS
SELF-INDULGENT,

31:22.780 --> 31:25.169
AND I STILL DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT IT'S ABOUT, YOU KNOW ?

31:25.280 --> 31:28.875
BUT I FIGURED,
DO THE WORK,

31:28.980 --> 31:30.413
STAY OUT OF
THE RESULTS.

31:30.520 --> 31:32.784
I LIKED THE COCK POEM
AT THE VERY BEGINNING.

31:32.890 --> 31:34.187
WHICH WAS TOTALLY
IMPROVISED, RIGHT ?

31:34.290 --> 31:36.485
WAS I TOO HARD
ON HIM ?

31:36.590 --> 31:38.455
OH NO,
NOT AT ALL.

31:38.560 --> 31:39.959
I MEAN,
HE WAS WEEPING...

31:40.060 --> 31:41.357
YEAH, BUT TWO CUTE GIRLS
FOLLOWED HIM OUT BACK.

31:41.460 --> 31:43.348
WELL, MAYBE HE'LL GET
A BLOWJOB OUT OF IT.

31:43.460 --> 31:47.396
SO, YOU'RE AT
LAC-ARTS, RIGHT ?

31:47.500 --> 31:49.263
YEAH.

31:49.370 --> 31:50.337
WHAT YEAR ?

31:50.440 --> 31:51.429
SOPHOMORE.

31:51.540 --> 31:52.404
YOU ?

31:52.510 --> 31:53.636
JUNIOR, I THINK.

31:53.740 --> 31:56.607
I HAVEN'T BEEN KEEPING TRACK
OF MY CREDITS OR ANYTHING.

31:56.710 --> 31:58.905
CLAIRE GREW UP
IN A FUNERAL HOME.

31:59.010 --> 32:00.773
WHY DID YOU HAVE
TO TELL HER THAT ?

32:00.880 --> 32:02.871
SO, WHAT'S
YOUR MEDIUM ?

32:02.980 --> 32:04.447
PHOTOGRAPHY, MOSTLY,

32:04.550 --> 32:07.485
YEAH, BUT I HAVEN'T PICKED UP
MY CAMERA IN LIKE MONTHS...

32:07.590 --> 32:09.512
WHY NOT ?

32:09.620 --> 32:11.349
I DON'T KNOW.

32:11.460 --> 32:13.826
I WENT THROUGH
A TOUGH TIME FOR A WHILE.

32:13.930 --> 32:15.522
BUT THAT'S THE BEST
TIME TO WORK.

32:15.630 --> 32:18.326
I MEAN, THAT'S WHEN
YOUR GUTS ARE ALL RAW

32:18.430 --> 32:20.591
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WASTE
TOO MUCH TIME THINKING ABOUT IT.

32:20.700 --> 32:22.531
YEAH, I JUST FEEL LIKE ANYTHIN
I DO IS GOING TO BE SHIT.

32:22.640 --> 32:23.789
SO?

32:23.900 --> 32:25.367
WHAT'S THE WORST
THAT CAN HAPPEN,

32:25.470 --> 32:27.665
I MEAN, SOME ASSHOLE
WILL MAKE FUN OF YOU ?

32:27.770 --> 32:29.306
LIKE YOU MADE FUN
OF POET GUY ?

32:29.410 --> 32:30.434
YEAH, EXACTLY,

32:30.540 --> 32:32.201
I MEAN, I'M SURE THERE
ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE HERE

32:32.310 --> 32:33.743
RIGHT NOW,
MAKING FUN OF ME.

32:33.850 --> 32:36.444
YEAH, I GUESS I'M JUST WAITING
FOR THE RIGHT TIME, YOU KNOW ?

32:36.550 --> 32:39.144
WELL, NONE OF US
MAY BE HERE TOMORROW.

32:39.250 --> 32:42.083
I MEAN, YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD KNOW THAT, RIGHT ?

32:58.940 --> 33:00.362
ARE YOU OKAY ?

33:03.940 --> 33:05.077
EVER SINCE LISA DIED,

33:05.180 --> 33:06.204
EVERY DEATH THAT
COMES THROUGH HERE

33:06.310 --> 33:08.574
FEELS LIKE HER
DYING ALL OVER AGAIN.

33:14.490 --> 33:16.583
IT'S ONLY BEEN
A FEW MONTHS, NATE.

33:16.690 --> 33:18.282
YEAH.

33:21.030 --> 33:23.021
I KEEP THINKING IT'S
GOING TO GET EASIER.

33:24.400 --> 33:26.698
NO ONE EVER SAID
IT EVER GETS EASY.

33:26.800 --> 33:28.631
NOT EASY,
EASIER.

33:30.240 --> 33:32.435
JUST FOR
FIVE FUCKING MINUTES.

33:37.710 --> 33:40.372
I CAN'T GET IT OUT OF
MY HEAD EVEN FOR THAT LONG,

33:43.050 --> 33:44.745
EVEN WHEN
I'M WITH MAYA.

33:54.030 --> 33:55.292
MOST OF ALL,
I JUST DON'T THINK

33:55.400 --> 33:56.856
I BELIEVE
ANY OF THIS ANYMORE.

33:56.960 --> 33:58.222
ANY OF WHAT ?

33:58.330 --> 34:01.629
THAT ANYTHING WE SAY OR DO
ACTUALLY HELPS ANYBODY.

34:07.040 --> 34:08.302
ALRIGHT, LOOK.

34:08.410 --> 34:11.038
( whispering )
I can't do this
anymore, David.

34:11.150 --> 34:13.345
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ?

34:13.450 --> 34:15.645
I'M SAYING
THAT I QUIT.

34:15.750 --> 34:16.717
YOU'RE QUITTING ?

34:16.820 --> 34:18.287
I'M NOT CUT OUT
FOR THIS.

34:19.290 --> 34:20.780
YOU'RE CUT OUT FOR THIS,
LIKE DAD WAS.

34:20.890 --> 34:22.187
RICO'S CUT OUT
FOR THIS.

34:22.290 --> 34:23.689
PROBABLY ARTHUR'S
CUT OUT FOR THIS.

34:23.790 --> 34:24.757
I'M NOT.

34:24.860 --> 34:26.157
I AM NOT.

34:26.260 --> 34:28.490
I'M NOT CUT OUT
FOR THIS.

34:28.600 --> 34:31.160
AND I HAVE GOT TO FIND SOME
OTHER KIND OF LIFE FOR MYSELF.

34:31.270 --> 34:33.830
AND NOT JUST FOR MYSELF,
BUT FOR MAYA, TOO.

34:35.170 --> 34:36.728
I HAVE TO.

34:40.110 --> 34:41.475
I'M SORRY.

34:46.010 --> 34:51.448
( moaning )

35:03.130 --> 35:05.826
( dialing )

35:05.930 --> 35:06.862
( phone ringing )

35:07.700 --> 35:08.268
( clearing throat)

35:08.370 --> 35:09.496
( male )
Hello ?

35:09.600 --> 35:10.999
IS THAT YOU MAKING
ALL THAT NOISE ?

35:11.100 --> 35:12.636
What noise ?

35:12.740 --> 35:18.030
SOUNDS KIND OF LIKE A MOOSE
THAT GOT HIT BY A MACK TRUCK.

35:18.150 --> 35:21.176
I beg your pardon,
I'm orgasming.

35:23.380 --> 35:25.484
BEFORE THE LANDLADY
CALLS ANIMAL CONTROL.

35:26.050 --> 35:27.142
I can't help it.

35:27.250 --> 35:29.411
Fantasizing about
making love to you

35:29.520 --> 35:32.853
is even better than
actual sex With most people.

35:32.960 --> 35:34.188
WHAT ARE YOU
WEARING ?

35:34.300 --> 35:35.392
At the moment ?

35:35.500 --> 35:36.319
MMM-HMM.

35:36.430 --> 35:37.499
Nothing.

35:38.670 --> 35:40.729
COME OVER IN THAT.

35:40.830 --> 35:41.831
YouWejoHng,

35:41.940 --> 35:43.134
MAYBE NOT.

35:43.240 --> 35:44.730
BUT COME NOW BEFORE
I CHANGE MY MIND.

35:44.840 --> 35:45.909
( dial tone )

36:02.020 --> 36:03.851
DID ANYONE SEE
YOU COME OVER ?

36:03.960 --> 36:05.120
I HOPE SO.

36:05.230 --> 36:06.754
GET IN HERE.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.865
WELL.

36:11.970 --> 36:13.597
THE BALL'S
IN YOUR COURT.

36:13.700 --> 36:14.735
SO TO SPEAK.

36:32.220 --> 36:33.619
IS EVERYTHING
ALRIGHT, DAVID ?

36:33.720 --> 36:36.450
AS A MATTER OF FACT, NO,
EVERYTHING IS NOT ALRIGHT.

36:36.560 --> 36:37.458
NATE QUIT.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.050
WHAT DO YOU
MEAN HE QUIT ?

36:39.160 --> 36:40.081
HIS JOB.

36:40.190 --> 36:41.589
WHEN ?

36:41.700 --> 36:42.849
LAST NIGHT.

36:42.960 --> 36:46.225
IT'S NOW "FISHER AND DIAZ"
AS IN ONE FISHER AND ONE DIAZ.

36:46.330 --> 36:50.596
WELL, YOU'VE BEEN
COMPLAINING ABOUT
NATE'S WORK.

36:50.700 --> 36:52.429
I WOULD THINK YOU'D BE
HAPPY IF HE TOOK A BREAK.

36:52.540 --> 36:54.474
MOM, HE'S NOT
TAKING A BREAK.

36:54.580 --> 36:55.399
HE QUIT.

36:55.510 --> 36:56.977
NOW THERE ARE
JUST TWO OF US.

36:57.080 --> 36:58.707
I ALREADY HAD
TO DROP OUT OF CHORUS

36:58.810 --> 37:00.141
SINCE HE'S ALMOST NEVER HERE
WHEN HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

37:00.250 --> 37:02.616
PERHAPS THIS IS
FOR THE BEST THEN.

37:02.720 --> 37:05.883
I SUPPOSE WE CAN GET ARTHUR
TO PICK UP MORE OF THE SLACK.

37:05.990 --> 37:09.710
HE CAN EMBALM AS LONG AS ONE
OF US IS IN THE ROOM WITH HIM.

37:09.820 --> 37:12.323
DID YOU KNOW THAT THE AVERAGE
AMERICAN CHANGES CAREER

37:12.430 --> 37:14.921
SEVEN TIMES DURING
HIS OR HER LIFETIME.

37:15.030 --> 37:16.190
HMM.

37:16.300 --> 37:18.222
IS THAT INFORMATION
SUPPOSED TO BE USEFUL

37:18.330 --> 37:20.195
IN SOME WAY,
GEORGE ?

37:20.300 --> 37:22.131
IT'S JUST A FACT.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.935
AH.

37:30.480 --> 37:31.879
( door slamming )

37:45.530 --> 37:47.657
HEY, I'M GONNA TAKE

38:22.530 --> 38:25.090
DOROTHY LOVED
ALL OF YOU.

38:25.200 --> 38:28.897
AND I KNOW THAT SHE'LL WATCH
DOWN ON US WHILE WE SLEEP.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.093
(vibrating )

38:31.200 --> 38:34.875
BUT KNOW THAT
SHE IS NOT GONE...

38:38.040 --> 38:39.905

HOW SWEET YOU ARE.

38:45.420 --> 38:47.718

38:49.260 --> 38:51.057
YEAH, HEY LOOK,

38:51.160 --> 38:52.479
I SHOULDN'T

38:52.590 --> 38:54.057
I was thinking

38:55.200 --> 38:56.724

38:56.830 --> 38:58.092
OKAY, PLEASE ?

39:10.610 --> 39:11.804
Nicole loves pizza

39:11.910 --> 39:14.344
WE CAN EAT IT TOGETHER

39:14.450 --> 39:15.644
IT'LL BE FUN,

IN A LITTLE BIT.

39:20.320 --> 39:22.709
OKAY, HURRY,

39:31.100 --> 39:34.467
UH, VAN ESSA JUST CALLED,

AUGUSTO HAS
AN EAR INFECTION,

TO TAKE HIM TO THE DOCTOR.

39:40.410 --> 39:42.537
OKAY, FINE, GO.

39:49.880 --> 39:51.017
( door closing )

40:01.960 --> 40:03.894
AAAH, SHIT !

40:04.000 --> 40:05.490
IT JUST STARTED,
AND THEN IT WOULDN'T STOP.

40:05.600 --> 40:06.828
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST.

40:06.930 --> 40:08.397
ALL THE BLOOD WE DRAIN
MUST'VE SOMEHOW BACKED UP

40:08.500 --> 40:09.728
INTO THE REST OF
THE HOUSE'S PLUMBING.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.535
AFTER WE JUST SPENT
38,000 DOLLARS

40:11.640 --> 40:14.359
FOR A WHOLE NEW SYSTEM
LESS THAN TWO YEARS AGO.

40:14.480 --> 40:16.334
SHOULD I CALL
THE PLUMBER ?

40:16.440 --> 40:19.375
YES, TELL HIM
IT'S AN EMERGENCY !

40:19.480 --> 40:21.778
AND DON'T LET ANYBODY
USE THE BATHROOM !

40:22.850 --> 40:25.444
THIS IS SO
FUCKING GROSS.

40:25.550 --> 40:27.040
WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING ?

40:27.150 --> 40:28.583
I'M TAKING PICTURES.

40:28.690 --> 40:30.248
THIS IS LIKE RIGHT
OUT OF "THE SHINING."

40:30.360 --> 40:31.827
THIS IS NOT COOL,
OR LEGAL !

40:31.930 --> 40:33.124
STOP IT !

40:33.230 --> 40:34.925
WHAT BUG CRAWLED UP
YOUR ASS ?

40:35.030 --> 40:36.850
THIS IS OUR
FAMILY BUSINESS, CLAIRE !

40:36.960 --> 40:38.689
EVEN IF I'M THE ONLY
ONE IN THE FAMILY

40:38.800 --> 40:40.119
WHO GIVES
A SHIT ANYMORE !

40:40.230 --> 40:42.095
WELL, WHAT IF
YOU NEED PHOTOS

40:42.200 --> 40:44.339
FOR LIKE THE INSURANCE COMPANY
OR SOMETHING ?

40:44.440 --> 40:47.136
ALRIGHT,
TAKE SOME MORE.

40:47.240 --> 40:50.607
BUT THIS IS NOT
AN ART PROJECT.

40:53.250 --> 40:54.774
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

40:54.880 --> 40:56.848
WHOO, OH !

40:57.380 --> 40:58.881
GOOD JOB.

40:58.990 --> 41:02.778
ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT.

41:02.890 --> 41:04.050
GOOD JOB.

41:19.670 --> 41:21.900
( chuckling )

41:23.580 --> 41:24.979
WELL, WHOEVER
DID YOUR LAST JOB

41:25.080 --> 41:27.275
CUT SOME CORNERS BY USING
PVC INSTEAD OF COPPER,

41:27.380 --> 41:29.575
AND THAT'S NOT GOOD.

41:29.680 --> 41:30.772
AND THEN YOU HAD
YOUR DRAINAGE LINE

41:30.880 --> 41:32.313
BURSTING AND BACKING UP
INTO YOUR SEPTIC

41:32.420 --> 41:33.546
AND ONCE THAT HAPPENED

41:33.650 --> 41:34.912
EVERYTHING KIND OF
WENT TO HELL FROM THERE.

41:35.020 --> 41:37.659
BUT I REPLACED ALL YOUR
BUSTED PVC WITH COPPER,

41:37.760 --> 41:40.320
AND YOU SHOULD
BE OKAY.

41:40.430 --> 41:43.695
I JUST NEED YOU
TO INITIAL HERE,

41:43.800 --> 41:47.190
HERE,
AND SIGN HERE.

41:53.910 --> 41:55.798
THANKS FOR
COMING SO QUICKLY.

41:55.910 --> 41:57.172
HEY, THAT'S...

41:57.280 --> 41:59.498
THAT'S WHAT
I'M HERE FOR.

42:12.590 --> 42:14.080
IS SOMETHING WRONG ?

42:14.190 --> 42:15.452
NO.

42:15.560 --> 42:17.118
I'M DOING
SOMETHING WRONG ?

42:17.230 --> 42:18.891
NO, NOT AT ALL.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.865
AMI?

42:20.970 --> 42:22.665
NOT AT ALL.

42:24.610 --> 42:26.339
IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD,
ISN'T IT ?

42:26.440 --> 42:27.668
IT'S ALWAYS WEIRD
IN THE BEGINNING.

42:27.770 --> 42:31.206
IS THIS MORE WEIRD,
OR LESS WEIRD ?

42:31.310 --> 42:32.948
YOU WANT ME
TO COMPARE ?

42:33.050 --> 42:34.199
NO.

42:34.310 --> 42:35.618
I MEAN, YES.

42:35.720 --> 42:37.369
I DO, KIND OF...

42:37.480 --> 42:39.516
BUT ONLY IF IT'S
A FAVORABLE COMPARISON.

42:39.620 --> 42:40.848
THIS IS FINE.

42:40.950 --> 42:42.383
OH, GOOD.

42:42.490 --> 42:43.514
IS IT GOOD
FOR YOU ?

42:43.620 --> 42:45.019
YES, DEFINITELY.

42:45.130 --> 42:47.655
GOOD, I'M GLAD.

42:47.760 --> 42:49.227
I THINK WE'RE
TALKING TOO MUCH ?

42:49.330 --> 42:50.319
YES.

42:50.430 --> 42:52.295
I REALLY LIKE YOU,
BRENDA.

42:52.400 --> 42:54.061
WE'RE DEFINITELY
TALKING TOO MUCH.

42:54.170 --> 42:57.139
( moaning )

43:14.290 --> 43:16.110
YOU CERTAINLY DO HAVE
A LOT OF HAIR IN YOUR EARS.

43:16.220 --> 43:18.256
I STILL HAVE
NO IDEA WHY,

43:18.360 --> 43:19.952
FROM AN EVOLUTIONARY
PERSPECTIVE,

43:20.060 --> 43:22.858
HOMO SAPIENS GET HAIRIER
THE OLDER THEY GET.

43:22.960 --> 43:26.020
YOU HAVE SUCH AN INTERESTING WAY
OF LOOKING AT THE WORLD, GEORGE.

43:27.870 --> 43:31.465
RUTH, I HAVE THE FEELING
THAT YOUR CHILDREN DON'T CARE

43:31.570 --> 43:33.162
ALL THAT MUCH
FOR ME.

43:33.270 --> 43:34.362
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

43:36.080 --> 43:38.298
PERHAPS YOU TRY A BIT
TOO HARD WITH THEM.

43:38.410 --> 43:40.503
I'M JUST TRYING TO HAVE
A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM,

43:40.610 --> 43:42.874
THAT'S ALL.

43:42.980 --> 43:46.643
I HATE TO SAY THIS,
BUT I'M FINDING YOUR FAMILY

43:46.750 --> 43:47.944
A LITTLE DIFFICULT
TO CONNECT WITH.

43:48.050 --> 43:50.280
TURN YOUR HEAD,
PLEASE.

43:51.220 --> 43:53.324
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

43:53.430 --> 43:55.489
MAYBE IF I DIDN'T
TRY SO HARD.

43:55.600 --> 43:58.160
I LOVE YOU JUST
THE WAY YOU ARE.

43:58.260 --> 44:00.069
AND SOONER OR LATER

44:00.170 --> 44:03.139
EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS FAMILY
WILL LOVE YOU, TOO.

44:08.410 --> 44:10.537
I QUIT MY JOB.

44:10.640 --> 44:13.006
I QUIT MY WHOLE
FUCKING LIFE.

44:13.110 --> 44:15.647
YOU DIDN'T QUIT,
YOU GOT FIRED.

44:15.750 --> 44:17.240
I GUESS
MAYBE I DID.

44:17.350 --> 44:20.478
IT MAY HAVE NOT THE BEST THING
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

44:20.590 --> 44:21.909
BUT IT'S RIGHT
UP THERE.

44:22.020 --> 44:23.715
GETTING MARRIED,
BECOMING A FATHER,

44:23.820 --> 44:25.720
GETTING CREAMED
BY A BUS,

44:25.830 --> 44:27.923
NOW THOSE ARE SOME OF
LIFE'S BIG MOMENTS.

44:28.030 --> 44:32.399
YOU WERE NEVER CUT OUT
FOR THIS BUSINESS.

44:32.500 --> 44:34.695
THAT'S WHAT
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

44:34.800 --> 44:37.860
I MEAN, IT'S ALL A BUNCH
OF BULLSHIT, RIGHT ?

44:37.970 --> 44:40.063
SOM ETIM ES, YES,
SOMETIMES, NO.

44:40.170 --> 44:43.139
SOMETIMES I'D EVEN
SURPRISE MYSELF WITH

44:43.240 --> 44:46.209
HOW HEARTFELT I'D FIND MYSELF
IN A GIVEN SITUATION,

44:46.310 --> 44:49.370
AND THEN SOMETIMES
YOU JUST SAY THE WORDS

44:49.480 --> 44:52.540
AND HOPE NOBODY REALIZES THAT
YOU'RE COMPLETELY FULL OF CRAP.

44:52.650 --> 44:55.517
IT HAPPENS
TO THE BEST OF US.

44:55.620 --> 44:58.259
BUT YOU'RE PROBABLY
BETTER OFF.

45:07.930 --> 45:10.330
I'D GIVE ANYTHING
IF LISA HADN'T DIED.

45:13.810 --> 45:15.505
BUT THEN AGAIN,
WHEN SHE WAS HERE,

45:15.610 --> 45:17.305
I JUST WANTED
TO BE FREE.

45:23.650 --> 45:25.208
YOU COMING INSIDE ?

45:25.320 --> 45:26.287
NO.

45:26.390 --> 45:28.711
NOT TODAY.

45:30.420 --> 45:31.785
THIS ONE ?

45:31.890 --> 45:33.778
SHE'S A KEEPER.

45:33.890 --> 45:35.050
YEAH, ISN'T
SHE THOUGH ?

45:35.160 --> 45:37.025
WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T FUCK THAT UP.

45:37.130 --> 45:40.361
YOU TAKE CARE OF
YOURSELF, BUDDY BOY.

45:51.510 --> 45:53.068
WHAT DO
WE HAVE HERE ?

45:56.820 --> 45:58.674
COME ON.

45:58.790 --> 46:00.940
SO YOU STILL HAVEN'T
EVEN SEEN CAMERON DIAZ ?

46:01.050 --> 46:02.711
IT'S ONLY BEEN TWO DAYS,
SHE'S VERY PRIVATE.

46:02.820 --> 46:04.822
APPARENTLY SO.

46:04.930 --> 46:07.979
IT'S A GLAMOROUS JOB,
WHAT CAN I SAY ?

46:10.000 --> 46:12.093
YOU LIKE THE GUYS
YOU'RE WORKING WITH ?

46:12.200 --> 46:13.497
THEY'RE OKAY.

46:19.110 --> 46:22.136
I GOT A BLOWJOB TODAY.

46:22.740 --> 46:24.799
YOU DID NOT.

46:27.680 --> 46:29.238
I DID.

46:33.450 --> 46:35.259
FROM WHO ?

46:35.360 --> 46:36.782
FROM THE PLUMBER.

46:38.860 --> 46:40.487
YOU GOT A BLOWJOB
FROM A PLUMBER ?

46:40.590 --> 46:42.455
HIS NAME WAS ANDY.

46:45.500 --> 46:46.990
A WHITE GUY ?

46:47.100 --> 46:50.536
YEAH, HE WAS GOOD
WITH A WRENCH.

46:52.610 --> 46:54.202
DID YOU RETURN
THE FAVOR ?

46:54.310 --> 46:55.800
NO!

47:02.920 --> 47:04.808
YOU BETTER NOT THINK
YOU'RE GETTING OUT

47:04.920 --> 47:06.842
OF HAVING SEX
WITH ME TONIGHT.

47:08.860 --> 47:09.986
OKAY.

47:10.090 --> 47:11.352
BUT I MIGHT NEED
YOU TO TALK ABOUT

47:11.460 --> 47:13.348
WATER RAMS
AND HAND SNAKES.

47:17.560 --> 47:19.323
( laughing )

47:19.430 --> 47:20.988
DO YOU SUPPOSE IT MIGHT BE
A LATE WEDDING PRESENT ?

47:21.100 --> 47:23.398
WELL, THERE'S
NO RETURN ADDRESS.

47:33.480 --> 47:35.141
WHAT IS IT ?

47:37.020 --> 47:38.317
I BELIEVE IT'S...

47:38.420 --> 47:39.318
FECES.

47:39.420 --> 47:40.614
FECES ?

47:40.720 --> 47:43.553
WHO IN THE WORLD WOULD
SEND YOU FECES IN THE MAIL ?

47:44.990 --> 47:46.252
I DON'T KNOW.

47:46.360 --> 47:48.180
LOOK AT THIS, MAYA,
SOMEBODY SENT GRANDPA

47:48.290 --> 47:50.520
A BIG, STEAMING
PILE OF DOOKY.

47:52.930 --> 47:54.158
WAIT.

47:54.270 --> 47:56.397
DON'T TH ROW IT AWAY
BEFORE I CAN GET MY CAMERA.

48:24.860 --> 48:27.522
* LOOKIN' AT THE DEVIL

48:29.100 --> 48:31.637
* GRINNIN' AT HIS GUN

48:33.570 --> 48:36.505
* FINGERS START SHAKIN'

48:37.680 --> 48:40.399
* I BEGIN TO RUN

48:41.980 --> 48:45.541
* BULLETS START CHASING
