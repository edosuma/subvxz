WEBVTT

00:16.960 --> 00:18.520
Hiya.

00:20.680 --> 00:23.440
Well, I fancied a day out
in Leeds meself, so...

00:25.680 --> 00:27.520
What's going on, Clare?

00:27.520 --> 00:30.080
Why is everybody pretending
you're going to Leeds

00:30.080 --> 00:32.400
when you're not? You're in
Sheffield.

00:35.120 --> 00:36.600
I know where they are.

00:38.840 --> 00:40.240
I saw 'em go in.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.200
Saw you drop them off.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.400
I don't go in with them.

00:47.400 --> 00:50.080
Once, you did.

00:50.080 --> 00:52.000
Once, I did.

00:54.240 --> 00:56.000
Why don't we just start
at t'beginning?

00:56.000 --> 00:58.240
Well, no, you could skip
the bit where our Becky

00:58.240 --> 01:00.480
hanged herself because of
what he did to her.

01:00.480 --> 01:03.400
And the bit where Ann Gallagher
was abducted, terrorised

01:03.400 --> 01:05.000
and raped for
the best part of a week,

01:05.000 --> 01:06.360
thinking she was going to die.

01:06.360 --> 01:08.640
And the bit where
Kirsten McAskill,

01:08.640 --> 01:10.680
sweet little Kirsten McAskill,

01:10.680 --> 01:13.000
had a car driven back and forth
over her till her innards

01:13.000 --> 01:15.800
burst out of every orifice
in her body.

01:15.800 --> 01:18.240
And the bit where I nearly died
in hospital,

01:18.240 --> 01:19.680
having me spleen removed.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.120
Yeah.

01:21.120 --> 01:24.120
Why don't we skip all that guff
and just cut to the chase?

01:26.480 --> 01:28.920
# There's a tower block overhead

01:28.920 --> 01:32.720
# And all you got is your benefits
and you're barely scraping by

01:36.200 --> 01:38.480
# In this trouble town

01:38.480 --> 01:41.600
# Troubles are found

01:46.760 --> 01:49.000
# Stuck in speed bump city

01:49.000 --> 01:53.440
# Where the only thing that's pretty
is the thought of getting out. #

02:10.120 --> 02:11.680
How you doing?

02:11.680 --> 02:13.280
I'm all right, thanks. How's
yourself?

02:13.280 --> 02:14.760
Yeah.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.600
Good, good.

02:17.880 --> 02:19.240
Yeah.

02:22.160 --> 02:23.280
Hey.

02:26.160 --> 02:28.040
Do you want to get tea
and biscuits, Neil?

02:28.040 --> 02:29.800
Yeah, yeah.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.280
Have you had a good week, then,
buddy?

02:35.280 --> 02:37.400
He's been writing to him
since he were ten.

02:37.400 --> 02:38.640
Ten?

02:38.640 --> 02:41.240
That...Frances, Cicely, Cecily,

02:41.240 --> 02:43.400
whatever her name
ended up being,

02:43.400 --> 02:46.600
gave him his address
at Gravesend.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.920
And he wrote. Ryan did.

02:48.920 --> 02:51.280
And he didn't hear owt back
for long enough,

02:51.280 --> 02:53.000
but he kept writing.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.640
Then when he...

02:56.840 --> 02:59.280
..moved up here,
which as far as I understand

02:59.280 --> 03:02.760
were a complete fluke, I don't
think he asked to be moved,

03:02.760 --> 03:05.040
he managed to get a message
to Ryan.

03:05.040 --> 03:06.160
How?

03:06.160 --> 03:07.920
We think somebody
he'd been inside with.

03:07.920 --> 03:10.520
Oh, do we?
Somebody...

03:10.520 --> 03:14.920
A man handed him an envelope
outside t'school gates.

03:14.920 --> 03:17.480
This were...don't know,
18 months ago?

03:17.480 --> 03:19.120
How did he know which school
he was at?

03:19.120 --> 03:20.400
I've no idea.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.640
We've no idea who he was.
Ryan doesn't.

03:22.640 --> 03:24.480
He's never seen him since. Jesus.

03:25.760 --> 03:30.320
Anyway, this note with his new
address at this prison here.

03:30.320 --> 03:34.640
And in the note, he said
he'd had all of Ryan's letters,

03:34.640 --> 03:37.320
everything he'd ever sent,
but he'd never answered him

03:37.320 --> 03:41.520
because he couldn't, short of
sending it to your house,

03:41.520 --> 03:44.920
which obviously
wasn't going to happen.

03:46.120 --> 03:49.480
And Ryan knew, he understood
it were impossible.

03:49.480 --> 03:52.080
So he'd given up ever expecting
anything back.

03:52.080 --> 03:54.160
But then,
after all that time...

03:55.520 --> 03:58.000
..he got this note asking him
to visit him.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.720
So... So you took him?

03:59.720 --> 04:00.920
No!

04:00.920 --> 04:02.480
I knew nowt about it.

04:03.960 --> 04:07.280
He asked Neil
if he'd help him,

04:07.280 --> 04:09.480
and I think Neil thought...

04:09.480 --> 04:11.040
I don't know.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.200
You know how persuasive

04:14.200 --> 04:16.680
Ryan can be.
I know how soft Neil is.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.080
Anyway, after the first time,

04:20.080 --> 04:23.560
Neil were worried he'd done
the wrong thing, so...

04:23.560 --> 04:26.000
..he told me.
And I were t'same as you -

04:26.000 --> 04:29.160
amazed, appalled.

04:29.160 --> 04:31.920
And I told him, I said,
"This has got to stop."

04:31.920 --> 04:35.120
But then Ryan got difficult
and angry and upset.

04:35.120 --> 04:37.680
And...the thing is, you see,

04:37.680 --> 04:39.920
he doesn't really know
a lot of what...

04:41.480 --> 04:43.760
He didn't live through it
like we did

04:43.760 --> 04:46.800
because we kept it from him,
as much as we could.

04:46.800 --> 04:49.720
He doesn't really know
what happened to Kirsten.

04:49.720 --> 04:51.640
He does.
He doesn't.

04:51.640 --> 04:55.640
He knows that she died
in appalling circumstances.

04:55.640 --> 04:58.240
He does.
He definitely knows that.

04:58.240 --> 05:00.160
He doesn't really know about
what happened with Ann.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.920
Do you really think
he don't Google stuff?

05:01.920 --> 05:05.760
And he also knows that
I was in hospital for weeks

05:05.760 --> 05:07.520
because of what he did to me.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.760
He doesn't really know
about what happened...

05:11.400 --> 05:12.480
..with his mother.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.040
Because he's never been told.

05:17.680 --> 05:19.120
Well, why didn't you tell me?

05:19.120 --> 05:20.520
Because I were frightened

05:20.520 --> 05:21.920
because of the way
it affects you.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.120
I kept saying
I wasn't comfortable

05:24.120 --> 05:26.080
or happy with it
and that you'd go mad, but...

05:26.080 --> 05:28.880
It's a really easy
conversation, Clare.

05:28.880 --> 05:31.800
You go, "There's a lot
you don't understand

05:31.800 --> 05:34.320
"and I hope you never have to.
But please,

05:34.320 --> 05:37.840
"please trust me when I say
that the answer is no, no, no.

05:37.840 --> 05:41.080
"You do not want to go visiting
that deranged,

05:41.080 --> 05:43.720
"murdering, subhuman
piece of excrement."

05:43.720 --> 05:46.280
I know, but you know...

05:46.280 --> 05:47.800
..he is his dad.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.120
He's not his dad.

05:50.200 --> 05:51.680
Don't you start calling him
his dad.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.360
Biologically, he is.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.560
And he's curious.

05:55.560 --> 05:56.840
Who wouldn't be?
He's growing up.

05:56.840 --> 05:58.440
He's growing up, he wants to know
things

05:58.440 --> 06:00.720
about himself.
God, this is mad, Clare.

06:00.720 --> 06:02.360
He's been writing to him
since he was ten.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.080
It in't going to go away.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.640
And it's only something he'd do
anyway, soon enough,

06:06.640 --> 06:07.760
when he's old enough.

06:07.760 --> 06:09.160
You're just weak.

06:10.280 --> 06:11.520
And naive.

06:11.520 --> 06:13.960
Well, obviously -
that's why he came to you.

06:13.960 --> 06:15.920
Cos nobody else
would have done it.

06:17.440 --> 06:18.880
I'm amazed you have.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.320
The one time I went in...

06:23.640 --> 06:25.560
..the second time
he visited him,

06:25.560 --> 06:27.720
I wanted to see
what were going on,

06:27.720 --> 06:30.160
what he wanted,
what he were after.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.800
And I think if I detected
anything off-kilter,

06:32.800 --> 06:35.520
I'm fairly certain
I would have told you.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.360
But I didn't.

06:37.360 --> 06:38.960
There were nothing.

06:38.960 --> 06:43.040
It were like they did just want
to get to know each other.

06:43.040 --> 06:45.400
And it's what the courts
would let him do anyway.

06:45.400 --> 06:46.520
You know that.

06:46.520 --> 06:49.600
He genuinely seemed thrilled
to see him

06:49.600 --> 06:51.760
and genuinely seemed to want to

06:51.760 --> 06:54.120
just get to know him. You
know, Clare, this is a fella...

06:56.120 --> 06:58.040
..who poured petrol over him

06:58.040 --> 06:59.760
and tried to set fire to him.

06:59.760 --> 07:00.960
Yeah, but he didn't.

07:00.960 --> 07:02.560
Yeah, because we stopped him.

07:02.560 --> 07:04.720
Well, he were in a very bad
place when he did that.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.080
For fuck's sake!

07:06.080 --> 07:08.400
He would have killed himself
as well, if he'd had done it.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.920
He weren't going to come
out of there laughing, was he?

07:10.920 --> 07:14.720
Are you seriously trying
to excuse the shit-pot?

07:14.720 --> 07:17.680
Look, I never asked to be
in this position

07:17.680 --> 07:21.600
and I've had to try and make
sense of it as best I could.

07:23.440 --> 07:26.560
Ah. You never were overly
bright, were you, Clare?

07:29.600 --> 07:32.400
Can I just try and say
what I'm trying to say, and why

07:32.400 --> 07:34.240
it wasn't just as simple as

07:34.240 --> 07:36.080
coming to tell you
what was going on?

07:36.080 --> 07:37.640
Oh, whatever.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.640
But I am going to
have to interrupt

07:40.640 --> 07:42.760
if you're going to
keep talking shit.

07:42.760 --> 07:45.960
What if seeing Ryan
having a good relationship

07:45.960 --> 07:48.480
with someone
he clearly thinks a lot of,

07:48.480 --> 07:50.600
who has been brought up well...

07:50.600 --> 07:54.840
What if seeing someone who
comes from a normal world

07:54.840 --> 07:55.960
makes this...

07:55.960 --> 07:58.920
..monster understand something

07:58.920 --> 08:01.880
about trying to be
a better person?

08:03.120 --> 08:06.040
What if this is
the one good thing,

08:06.040 --> 08:08.000
the one good, simple
relationship

08:08.000 --> 08:10.080
that he's never had before,

08:10.080 --> 08:13.080
that makes a difference?
What if through this,

08:13.080 --> 08:16.920
because of this, it got to
a point where Tommy...

08:16.920 --> 08:20.640
Oh, "Tommy".
..understood enough

08:20.640 --> 08:24.280
about how abnormal
his behaviour's been?

08:24.280 --> 08:28.960
And what if he got to a place
where he wanted to be different

08:28.960 --> 08:32.120
and he wanted to be forgiven?

08:32.120 --> 08:35.520
And if that happened, if,

08:35.520 --> 08:37.800
and if you could forgive him...

08:39.000 --> 08:40.920
..wouldn't that be better?

08:42.160 --> 08:44.680
For you more than anyone.

08:44.680 --> 08:48.400
And I mean, it's not like he'll
ever get out of there, is it?

08:48.400 --> 08:51.000
He will die in there,
and he should. He should.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.760
Of course he should.

08:52.760 --> 08:55.400
But if there were a way
of finding some...

08:56.880 --> 08:58.720
..peace...

09:00.000 --> 09:02.640
..wouldn't that be something?

09:04.000 --> 09:05.680
And maybe...

09:05.680 --> 09:08.920
..I don't know,
maybe this is where it starts.

09:12.640 --> 09:15.840
Has he given you any indication
that he wants to be forgiven?

09:15.840 --> 09:17.400
No. No.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.320
No. And he won't, Clare,

09:19.320 --> 09:21.920
because some people are just
too far beyond the pale.

09:21.920 --> 09:23.240
And you know...

09:24.320 --> 09:26.160
..it's not even his fault.

09:26.160 --> 09:28.560
He was born this way,
with this...this kink,

09:28.560 --> 09:31.160
this...this absence,
and, yeah, certainly

09:31.160 --> 09:33.760
being brought up by
a heroin addict didn't help.

09:33.760 --> 09:35.840
And that's why we
throw away the key.

09:35.840 --> 09:37.560
I'll tell you what,

09:37.560 --> 09:39.440
here's the deal.

09:39.440 --> 09:42.080
when he asks me
to forgive him...

09:42.080 --> 09:43.560
..I will.

09:46.200 --> 09:47.360
How about that?

09:47.360 --> 09:49.480
It won't happen.

09:49.480 --> 09:52.800
He's a narcissist,
he's a psychopath.

09:52.800 --> 09:56.240
I can tell you for a fact
that it won't happen.

09:56.240 --> 09:57.640
And have you considered,

09:57.640 --> 10:00.280
whilst Ryan's having this
marvellous effect on him,

10:00.280 --> 10:01.960
what the effect on Ryan is

10:01.960 --> 10:03.960
going into a place like that?
A Cat A prison

10:03.960 --> 10:05.880
full of the worst,
most damaged,

10:05.880 --> 10:07.520
most sick people on Earth?

10:07.520 --> 10:09.080
He's young, he's impressionable.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.160
He shouldn't even have to

10:10.160 --> 10:11.880
think about people like that
at his age,

10:11.880 --> 10:13.680
and I have done my damnedest

10:13.680 --> 10:15.720
to keep him away
from any of it.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.880
And you have just...

10:34.200 --> 10:36.080
You have just...

10:37.400 --> 10:40.400
..blithely let him
go in there.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.080
There were nothing blithe
about it.

10:42.080 --> 10:43.240
He wanted to go in there.

10:43.240 --> 10:45.000
Why did you only go in once?

10:48.880 --> 10:50.920
Because I didn't like it.

10:50.920 --> 10:52.200
Yeah.

10:54.440 --> 10:56.360
But you let him go in.

10:56.360 --> 10:59.000
I wasn't the one
who wanted to see him.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.560
I am not going to fall out
with you, Catherine.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.160
Is it your choice?

11:04.160 --> 11:06.920
Nobody means more to me
than you do, you know that.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.280
Just tell that Neil

11:17.280 --> 11:20.520
that I'll deal with him
when I see him.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.200
Stupid bitch.

11:27.480 --> 11:29.160
Fucking hell.

12:19.160 --> 12:20.520
Fucking...

12:39.080 --> 12:40.480
Time's up!

12:40.480 --> 12:42.280
Hey, you know I'm going to be in
Leeds?

12:42.280 --> 12:44.320
When?
This Tuesday.

12:46.880 --> 12:50.480
I pleaded guilty
to this...thing.

12:50.480 --> 12:53.080
I didn't do owt,
but I were there, so...

12:54.200 --> 12:57.760
..anyway, I'll be in court
in Leeds.

12:57.760 --> 13:00.000
You should come and see me
if you like.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.200
You could sit in the visitors'
gallery. Can we?

13:03.200 --> 13:04.600
Yeah. Yeah...

13:04.600 --> 13:05.880
Yeah.

13:05.880 --> 13:07.920
Oh, no, it's Tuesday.
I'll be in school.

13:07.920 --> 13:10.960
Yeah - see if you can get
a day off, then, eh?

13:10.960 --> 13:13.640
Hey, and stick up for yourself
wi' this Hepworth.

13:13.640 --> 13:15.280
He sounds like a dick.

13:15.280 --> 13:17.800
Yeah. I think things might
be better now.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.400
You, keep an eye on him.

13:19.400 --> 13:21.560
Think Catherine's
got that covered.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.120
Who?

13:23.120 --> 13:24.400
Sorry.

13:24.400 --> 13:25.520
Come on.

13:25.520 --> 13:28.080
Ta-ta.
Yeah, see ya.

13:31.040 --> 13:32.600
Hey, how was your skydiving?

13:32.600 --> 13:33.960
Oh, my God. It was immense.

13:33.960 --> 13:35.320
Yeah? Yeah.

13:35.320 --> 13:36.920
Oh, I want to do that.

13:36.920 --> 13:39.520
One day, eh? You and me.
Bungee jumping!

13:39.520 --> 13:41.200
That's what I want to do.
Do ya?

13:41.200 --> 13:43.360
Yeah, we'll do it.
That's what we'll do.

13:44.920 --> 13:46.400
Yeah. You coming, Neil?

13:46.400 --> 13:47.960
No, I'm past all that.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.360
I'll come and watch, though,
and take some pictures.

13:50.360 --> 13:51.520
It's a date.

13:51.520 --> 13:53.040
See ya...

13:54.160 --> 13:55.800
..Dad.

13:59.720 --> 14:02.200
Why do you think
he says stuff like that?

14:02.200 --> 14:04.640
We aren't going bungee jumping.

14:04.640 --> 14:07.520
Even if he got parole,
which he won't...

14:08.800 --> 14:11.400
..by the time he got out,
he'd be, like, 80.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.880
And I'd be,
like, 60 or something.

14:13.880 --> 14:16.480
You know, perhaps
when you're in for life...

14:16.480 --> 14:21.200
Perhaps you need to use
a bit of...self-kidology, eh?

14:22.840 --> 14:24.640
Keep yourself going.

14:26.280 --> 14:28.720
Oh, here she is.
Come on.

14:42.720 --> 14:44.000
She knows.

14:45.680 --> 14:46.760
What?

14:48.120 --> 14:49.480
She knows.

15:01.520 --> 15:02.920
Aah!

17:27.520 --> 17:28.760
What are you doing?!

17:28.760 --> 17:30.360
I just wanted to say...

17:31.400 --> 17:33.480
..I think you should do
what you said.

17:33.480 --> 17:36.400
I think you - we - should...

17:36.400 --> 17:38.080
..you know.

17:41.240 --> 17:42.760
Send him on his way.

17:44.600 --> 17:47.240
Are you around
Monday lunchtime?

18:11.960 --> 18:15.160
I had this idea that
I'd try and tell him the truth,

18:15.160 --> 18:18.000
or a version of it,
when he was 18.

18:20.040 --> 18:22.120
I thought,
let him have his birthday,

18:22.120 --> 18:23.560
give it a week, and then...

18:25.560 --> 18:27.840
..tell him that his mother
didn't die in childbirth.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.040
But then be very clear...

18:30.400 --> 18:33.440
..about the fact that his...

18:33.440 --> 18:35.160
..that his da...

18:49.360 --> 18:51.240
That his dad...

18:53.680 --> 18:57.040
..is not someone he should
feel under any obligation

18:57.040 --> 18:58.960
to get to know.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.520
And then let him
make the choice.

19:06.920 --> 19:09.920
But be clear, if he did choose
to get to know him,

19:09.920 --> 19:11.400
that that would have to be it

19:11.400 --> 19:13.560
as far as him and me
were concerned, because...

19:15.200 --> 19:17.840
..for them to have
any kind of a relationship

19:17.840 --> 19:19.640
after what happened to Becky...

19:21.640 --> 19:24.360
..would be so repugnant to me

19:24.360 --> 19:27.360
that it isn't something
I'd be prepared to live with.

19:27.360 --> 19:29.040
But it's happened.

19:29.040 --> 19:31.800
They are having some kind
of relationship

19:31.800 --> 19:34.720
and I didn't know a damn thing
about it.

19:34.720 --> 19:37.680
And it sounds like they
get on like house on fire.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.160
So...

19:42.240 --> 19:44.720
Ten years old.

19:44.720 --> 19:47.000
All this time, you think
you know someone,

19:47.000 --> 19:48.200
you live with someone.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.760
God, I must be slow.

19:50.880 --> 19:53.160
The fact that he never
mentioned him

19:53.160 --> 19:54.880
should have rung
alarm bells, but...

19:54.880 --> 19:56.720
..instead, I just allowed
myself to think

19:56.720 --> 19:58.520
that he didn't even
think about him any more.

19:58.520 --> 19:59.640
That he kind of got it.

20:00.920 --> 20:03.880
And there's me thinking Clare's
the naive one, bloody hell.

20:07.160 --> 20:08.720
Clare should have told you.

20:08.720 --> 20:11.320
He's going to have to go
and live there with them.

20:13.040 --> 20:15.120
Not having him here.

20:16.480 --> 20:18.080
I'm sorry.

20:20.200 --> 20:21.400
What?

20:22.800 --> 20:26.080
I'm sorry I left you
on your own to deal with it...

20:27.320 --> 20:28.520
..when she died.

20:30.680 --> 20:33.160
Can't imagine
why I did that, now.

20:35.680 --> 20:37.200
What a coward.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.560
We both did what we had to do.

20:42.680 --> 20:45.080
I think we both probably
went a bit mad.

20:46.680 --> 20:49.240
I think the only way to cope
with something like that

20:49.240 --> 20:50.880
is to go a bit mad for a while.

21:18.680 --> 21:20.920
You all right?
Should've told her.

21:20.920 --> 21:23.680
You should have told me before
you took him that first time.

21:25.080 --> 21:27.320
What are you going to say
when she asks? Cos she will.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.160
Same as I told you.

21:30.440 --> 21:31.840
Felt sorry for him.

21:33.720 --> 21:36.760
And if I didn't take him,
who would?

21:37.800 --> 21:39.560
It's what he wanted, Clare.

21:45.800 --> 21:48.280
Ryan, come on, love,
it's ready. Turn that off.

22:05.680 --> 22:07.360
Where is he?

22:09.200 --> 22:10.560
Ryan!

22:12.920 --> 22:14.280
Come on.

22:14.280 --> 22:16.480
Better face the music
sooner rather than later.

22:18.400 --> 22:21.240
I'm sorry, Catherine.
He should never have taken him,

22:21.240 --> 22:22.880
and I should have come
and told you,

22:22.880 --> 22:24.880
and we shouldn't...
Yeah, but you did, so...

22:24.880 --> 22:26.800
Him? Neil? Whatever.
But you?

22:26.800 --> 22:28.120
Fuck.

22:28.120 --> 22:29.480
What have you brought that for?

22:29.480 --> 22:31.240
So obviously you knew
this was a problem,

22:31.240 --> 22:32.720
which is why you
haven't told me about it.

22:32.720 --> 22:34.600
You're not chucking me out.
I brought your pyjamas

22:34.600 --> 22:36.040
and a toothbrush
and a sleeping bag

22:36.040 --> 22:37.760
and I think it might be best
if you stay here

22:37.760 --> 22:39.200
a few nights. What about my games?

22:39.200 --> 22:40.800
Can I have two minutes
with him?

22:47.440 --> 22:49.640
So obviously
this is all my fault

22:49.640 --> 22:52.000
for not addressing things
more clearly with you.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.760
I thought in some ways I had,
but...

22:54.760 --> 22:56.840
Perhaps I thought
you'd picked up on

22:56.840 --> 22:58.560
more than you have,
but maybe not.

22:58.560 --> 23:00.280
So...
I need my gaming things.

23:00.280 --> 23:01.920
Yeah, I'll get your games
tomorrow.

23:01.920 --> 23:03.640
Not trailing back and forth
again tonight.

23:03.640 --> 23:04.960
It's only round the corner.

23:04.960 --> 23:06.960
I'll come and get it.
There are things you need

23:06.960 --> 23:08.960
to understand, so that
your decision to visit...

23:10.360 --> 23:12.960
..to keep visiting him,
if that's your plan,

23:12.960 --> 23:14.600
is as informed

23:14.600 --> 23:16.480
as it can be. I don't want to talk
about it.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.160
No, neither do I,
so I'll be brief.

23:18.160 --> 23:19.920
So the first thing
to be clear about

23:19.920 --> 23:21.960
is that the way this man is,
who you're choosing to visit,

23:21.960 --> 23:23.240
isn't necessarily hereditary.

23:23.240 --> 23:24.960
All right?
Do you know what that means?

23:24.960 --> 23:27.440
Hereditary? Yeah. Tell me what you
think it means. Why?

23:27.440 --> 23:29.240
So I know you know
what I'm talking about.

23:29.240 --> 23:31.280
It's like what you inherit,

23:31.280 --> 23:32.960
like, genes from your parents.

23:32.960 --> 23:35.120
Right. And grandparents. Yeah.

23:35.120 --> 23:39.200
So...yeah, some things you
inherit, some things not.

23:40.920 --> 23:44.040
So he has a kink in his brain.

23:44.040 --> 23:45.600
A twist.

23:46.720 --> 23:48.400
A psychological...

23:49.520 --> 23:50.760
..deformity.

23:50.760 --> 23:53.560
It's an absence of something
that allows him to...

23:53.560 --> 23:55.960
..possibly seem
quite normal to you,

23:55.960 --> 23:58.120
but it allows him
to do things -

23:58.120 --> 24:00.080
evil things, nasty things,

24:00.080 --> 24:03.280
things that normal people
just wouldn't do,

24:03.280 --> 24:06.080
things that he's ended up
in prison for.

24:06.080 --> 24:07.520
For ever.

24:08.840 --> 24:11.640
Now, you don't have that kink,
that absence.

24:11.640 --> 24:13.400
You have a normal brain.

24:13.400 --> 24:15.000
Yeah, I know.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.440
You are not evil. Yes!

24:16.440 --> 24:18.520
And... Yeah, don't speak to me
like that.

24:20.120 --> 24:22.240
So what you have to understand
is... Right,

24:22.240 --> 24:23.560
you know, my tea's going cold.

24:23.560 --> 24:25.400
What you having?
Stew.

24:25.400 --> 24:28.000
That'll be all right.
What you have to understand...

24:28.000 --> 24:30.400
I'm not a weirdo.
Neil's explained all this.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.600
Has he?
Kind of.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.040
All right. OK.

24:37.120 --> 24:39.040
OK. Well, good.

24:40.200 --> 24:41.840
OK.

24:41.840 --> 24:44.520
So what you also have to
understand is...

24:46.720 --> 24:49.800
..is that he wasn't very nice
to your mum.

24:49.800 --> 24:51.600
Has Neil told you that?

24:51.600 --> 24:53.640
No. OK.

24:53.640 --> 24:55.120
So when your mum died...

24:56.480 --> 24:57.960
..it broke my heart.

25:00.520 --> 25:02.440
And I can't tell you why
or how,

25:02.440 --> 25:04.640
you're just going to have
to trust me,

25:04.640 --> 25:06.040
but it was his fault.

25:06.040 --> 25:08.320
How? Did he kill her?

25:08.320 --> 25:10.400
No. How, then?

25:10.400 --> 25:12.480
Well, it's complicated,
and like I said,

25:12.480 --> 25:15.080
you're going to have to trust me.
But this is how serious it is.

25:16.800 --> 25:18.720
If you continue to visit him,

25:18.720 --> 25:21.000
if you continue to choose
to visit him...

25:22.320 --> 25:23.800
..you can't live with me.

25:23.800 --> 25:25.040
Why?

25:25.040 --> 25:26.760
I thought she died giving birth
to me.

25:26.760 --> 25:28.480
Well, it was just after.

25:28.480 --> 25:29.760
How was it his fault, then?

25:29.760 --> 25:30.920
I've said all I can say.

25:30.920 --> 25:33.800
No, tell me!
I've asked you to trust me.

25:33.800 --> 25:37.600
Everything I do,
everything I've ever done

25:37.600 --> 25:39.360
is in your best interests.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.520
I don't want you
to keep visiting him.

25:43.520 --> 25:46.200
And if you do want to keep
visiting him,

25:46.200 --> 25:48.640
you're going to have to live here
with these two.

25:51.040 --> 25:53.000
Did she kill herself?

25:55.240 --> 25:57.480
But he loved her.
He's told me.

25:59.080 --> 26:01.480
I've got to go now.
So why would she?

26:01.480 --> 26:02.640
People who love people

26:02.640 --> 26:04.800
don't treat people
the way he treated her.

26:04.800 --> 26:06.320
So, did she? Kill herself?

26:07.320 --> 26:09.360
I can't live here. It's tiny.

26:09.360 --> 26:10.720
Dwell on it.

26:33.040 --> 26:35.960
What a...fucking mess.

27:02.240 --> 27:06.080
So why has Neil

27:06.080 --> 27:09.760
taken it upon himself
to do that?

27:09.760 --> 27:12.120
Who knows?
Because he's an odd bod.

27:13.880 --> 27:16.840
He had limited access to his
own kids after his divorce,

27:16.840 --> 27:18.800
because of the drinking.

27:18.800 --> 27:21.320
So my mum thinks it might be
summat to do with that, but...

27:21.320 --> 27:22.960
..you know, they were kids

27:22.960 --> 27:24.840
that he'd had
a relationship with

27:24.840 --> 27:27.400
for the first 14 or 15 years
of their lives.

27:27.400 --> 27:29.040
And Clare?

27:30.320 --> 27:31.920
How is your mum?

27:34.840 --> 27:36.720
Bewildered.

27:39.920 --> 27:42.080
The mad thing is, though,

27:42.080 --> 27:44.880
even if she did get
a court order,

27:44.880 --> 27:48.040
they'd probably think
it was a good thing,

27:48.040 --> 27:51.480
you know, for him to have
a relationship with his dad.

27:52.480 --> 27:53.840
Is she all right?

28:00.600 --> 28:02.920
Anything to do with
that evil piece of...

28:02.920 --> 28:05.680
..dirt just stirs it all up
for her again, you know?

28:17.400 --> 28:18.960
Aye-aye.

28:24.760 --> 28:26.840
I thought you'd stopped.

28:26.840 --> 28:29.040
Yeah, well, I haven't.

28:47.720 --> 28:48.920
I love you.

28:52.160 --> 28:53.360
I know.

28:53.360 --> 28:55.720
And he can't touch you.

28:55.720 --> 28:57.320
He will die in there.

29:01.640 --> 29:03.480
It's just...

29:03.480 --> 29:05.600
..anything to do with him,
it's like...

29:07.640 --> 29:08.680
Just...

29:10.920 --> 29:12.720
..fucks me up.

29:12.720 --> 29:14.560
I know. I know.

29:14.560 --> 29:16.240
I know.

29:27.560 --> 29:29.960
I start my attachment to CID
tomorrow.

29:33.160 --> 29:35.920
You are, are you?

29:35.920 --> 29:38.720
I put in an application
months ago.

29:38.720 --> 29:40.160
I did tell you.

29:41.560 --> 29:43.360
Very good.

29:43.360 --> 29:44.560
Good for you.

29:44.560 --> 29:47.520
Yeah! Yeah. Yeah? Yeah!

29:51.720 --> 29:53.360
Just shit timing.

29:56.160 --> 29:57.560
Come and live round ours.

29:57.560 --> 29:59.880
Your mum doesn't like me.
She does.

29:59.880 --> 30:02.360
She'll be fine.
She'll be thrilled.

30:02.360 --> 30:04.600
You can have my bed.
I'll sleep on t'floor.

30:04.600 --> 30:07.280
You can't be doing with dogs
barking and babies crying.

30:07.280 --> 30:09.560
Not when you've got your GCSEs
coming up.

30:09.560 --> 30:11.000
You'll go crazy.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.880
What are babies for, even?
They just cry

30:13.880 --> 30:16.400
and shit. You should have
knocked on t'wall.

30:16.400 --> 30:17.880
I'd have knocked on t'wall.

30:19.760 --> 30:21.840
No bloody way.

30:21.840 --> 30:24.120
What? The bi-atch.

30:24.120 --> 30:27.160
Leave it. It's fine.
"But he is homeless."

30:27.160 --> 30:29.480
I put homeless in capitals.
I'm not homeless.

30:29.480 --> 30:31.120
And an exclamation mark.

30:31.120 --> 30:33.480
A one-bedroom flat with
a couple of alcoholics?

30:33.480 --> 30:34.840
I think you are.

30:34.840 --> 30:37.440
Recovering alcoholics... That's not
the same... Cawood!

30:37.440 --> 30:38.880
Ryan.

30:40.480 --> 30:42.640
You all right, lad?
Yeah.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.880
Just to say, you played
very well on Saturday.

30:44.880 --> 30:47.120
I'm glad we've cleared the air.

30:47.120 --> 30:48.360
Did you win?

30:48.360 --> 30:51.840
No, but Ryan made some
very respectable saves.

30:51.840 --> 30:54.080
What's the matter?
"Tell him,

30:54.080 --> 30:58.080
"whatever the hell he's done,
to apologise to his granny."

30:58.080 --> 31:01.520
He's had a bust-up
with his granny, so he's gone

31:01.520 --> 31:04.640
to live with his Auntie Clare
and she's a bit...flaky.

31:04.640 --> 31:06.600
What was it about?

31:06.600 --> 31:08.320
His dad. Me dad.

31:08.320 --> 31:10.960
Didn't know you had a dad.
He's in prison.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.160
Do you, er,
want to talk about it?

31:17.160 --> 31:20.520
To someone? Could help.

31:20.520 --> 31:23.160
It doesn't have to be me. Or...

31:24.280 --> 31:26.120
Well, it could be.

31:26.120 --> 31:27.840
Be good to talk.

31:35.520 --> 31:37.440
Wish me luck, Dad!

31:37.440 --> 31:39.320
Why? What are you doing?
Science test!

31:39.320 --> 31:41.760
She's talked about nowt else
since last night.

31:41.760 --> 31:43.560
Oh, sorry.
Yes. Good luck.

31:43.560 --> 31:45.640
And don't say "nowt"!
Say nothing.

31:45.640 --> 31:48.360
Big day.
Big day in Toy Town.

31:48.360 --> 31:49.560
Shut your mouth. Oi, oi, oi!

31:49.560 --> 31:51.360
Tell her, Dad!
Just do your best.

31:51.360 --> 31:53.840
Thanks for driving us in, again,
Dad.

31:53.840 --> 31:55.360
See ya.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.240
You don't need to bust
a gut, is all I'm saying.

32:00.240 --> 32:02.360
They'll only pay for
one of us to get through

32:02.360 --> 32:04.200
medical school,
and it won't be you.

32:04.200 --> 32:05.600
You'll be cleaning toilets,

32:05.600 --> 32:06.920
so why bother? No, I won't!

32:06.920 --> 32:08.320
It's what happened to him.

32:08.320 --> 32:09.880
See ya!

32:09.880 --> 32:11.680
Grandma and Grandad
paid for Uncle Maruf

32:11.680 --> 32:13.320
to do seven years
at medical school.

32:13.320 --> 32:14.720
He had to pay for himself,

32:14.720 --> 32:16.800
so he could only afford to
study pharmacy for four years.

32:16.800 --> 32:19.080
That's why he's got such
a massive chip on his shoulder.

32:26.320 --> 32:27.800
I kind of knew.

32:27.800 --> 32:29.440
Kind of worked it out.

32:29.440 --> 32:31.760
But then me Auntie Clare
told me,

32:31.760 --> 32:33.600
cos I made her. And do you know why

32:33.600 --> 32:35.520
your mum did that?

32:35.520 --> 32:38.080
They were, like,
seeing each other.

32:38.080 --> 32:40.760
And my dad says he loved her,
and I think he did,

32:40.760 --> 32:42.920
in his own way.

32:42.920 --> 32:45.360
But I think it was, you know...

32:45.360 --> 32:47.400
..an abusive relationship.

32:47.400 --> 32:50.520
So me granny blames him
when she gets upset.

32:50.520 --> 32:53.120
Like when we visit me mum,
up in Heptonstall.

32:53.120 --> 32:54.640
You visit your mum?

32:54.640 --> 32:56.720
Where she's buried.
Ah.

33:02.440 --> 33:05.560
I'm sorry...
if I've been hard on you.

33:05.560 --> 33:08.280
I didn't realise you had
all this to contend with.

33:08.280 --> 33:09.880
I haven't, normally.

33:09.880 --> 33:12.320
She's found out
I've been going to see him,

33:12.320 --> 33:13.760
so she's flipped her lid.

33:14.920 --> 33:18.040
How would you feel if you did
have to stop visiting him?

33:18.040 --> 33:19.400
Bad.

33:20.600 --> 33:24.160
Family life is often difficult
to negotiate,

33:24.160 --> 33:26.560
even when it's not
as complicated as yours.

33:33.960 --> 33:35.360
My marriage...

33:37.040 --> 33:39.520
..isn't a happy one.

33:39.520 --> 33:40.800
Isn't it?

33:45.480 --> 33:48.240
We all have our crosses
to bear.

33:49.600 --> 33:52.400
But I want you to know,
the door's always open.

33:54.760 --> 33:56.240
All right?

33:57.760 --> 33:59.040
You'd better get on.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.760
The dead woman
is Danielle Womersley.

34:14.760 --> 34:16.560
She's 28 years old,

34:16.560 --> 34:18.040
and what seems to have happened

34:18.040 --> 34:19.560
is that she fell
from the window

34:19.560 --> 34:21.120
trying to escape from the flat,

34:21.120 --> 34:23.960
or possibly trying to take
her own life.

34:23.960 --> 34:25.720
She's registered blind.

34:25.720 --> 34:29.040
No family's been identified,
but there is a boyfriend,

34:29.040 --> 34:30.760
and he was in the flat

34:30.760 --> 34:33.360
when she was trying to
climb out of the window.

34:33.360 --> 34:36.200
The room that she was
escaping from was locked,

34:36.200 --> 34:39.720
and CCTV shows a man
leaving the flat,

34:39.720 --> 34:41.520
possibly when he's realised

34:41.520 --> 34:44.400
that she was taking a dive
out of the window.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.000
Now he doesn't go
and check on her.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.600
He don't call for an ambulance.

34:47.600 --> 34:50.160
He leaves the flat carrying
these two rucksacks

34:50.160 --> 34:54.000
and he drives off to an address
in Queensbury in this Toyota.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.800
Do we know
what's in the rucksacks?

34:55.800 --> 34:57.640
Cash? Socks? His toothbrush?

34:57.640 --> 35:00.520
Well, given the amount of cash
that was found at the address,

35:00.520 --> 35:02.800
upwards of 40 grand,
then, yeah,

35:02.800 --> 35:05.120
it's possible he was trying to
move as much cash as he can,

35:05.120 --> 35:07.080
as fast as he can,
when he's realised

35:07.080 --> 35:09.360
that things
aren't going to plan.

35:09.360 --> 35:13.120
Now, the Toyota is registered
to a Josip Matic

35:13.120 --> 35:14.920
at an address in Queensbury.

35:14.920 --> 35:17.760
H-MET have got obs on
an address in Queensbury -

35:17.760 --> 35:20.360
not his registered address,
but we've had other intel

35:20.360 --> 35:21.600
and we know he's in there.

35:21.600 --> 35:23.400
It's a street
we're all familiar with,

35:23.400 --> 35:24.680
so I've alerted uniform

35:24.680 --> 35:26.920
that we might need some
assistance with the arrest,

35:26.920 --> 35:30.040
which we're going to move on
sometime later this morning.

35:30.040 --> 35:31.360
Two other males were seen

35:31.360 --> 35:34.000
coming and going from the
Elland flat the previous week,

35:34.000 --> 35:36.960
and the same two males
the week before that,

35:36.960 --> 35:39.720
so they need to be ID'd
as a priority.

35:48.840 --> 35:51.280
"In light of recent incidents,
sightings and happenings

35:51.280 --> 35:52.960
"across the Yorkshire
and Humberside area,

35:52.960 --> 35:55.080
"the Home Office
has deemed it necessary

35:55.080 --> 35:56.600
"to appoint in each division

35:56.600 --> 35:59.480
"one constable
as a dedicated...

35:59.480 --> 36:02.480
"..alien life-form
liaison officer."

36:02.480 --> 36:04.640
Serious?
A what?

36:04.640 --> 36:06.680
An alien life-form

36:06.680 --> 36:08.720
liaison officer.
Is that a joke?

36:08.720 --> 36:10.440
Do I look like a comedian?

36:10.440 --> 36:12.600
No, Sarge.
No. And just to be clear,

36:12.600 --> 36:14.160
I think they're taking the piss

36:14.160 --> 36:16.080
when we're so short-staffed,
but who am I to question

36:16.080 --> 36:18.560
the wisdom of
the Home Secretary?

36:18.560 --> 36:20.240
"If anyone is interested,

36:20.240 --> 36:23.080
"the successful applicant
must have completed

36:23.080 --> 36:24.840
"their probationary period

36:24.840 --> 36:27.120
"and must demonstrate
an interest

36:27.120 --> 36:31.920
"in unexplained aerial
phenomena in the locality."

36:31.920 --> 36:35.200
There are application forms
here, if anyone is interested.

36:35.200 --> 36:36.840
I'll have a look.

36:36.840 --> 36:39.360
This is right up my street,
Sarge.

36:39.360 --> 36:40.800
Is it? Very good.

36:40.800 --> 36:42.840
Did you hear what happened
to me yesterday?

36:42.840 --> 36:44.280
I did, yes. So,

36:44.280 --> 36:46.680
there must have been
other sightings as well

36:46.680 --> 36:48.480
in the Yorkshire
and Humberside area.

36:48.480 --> 36:50.600
That's, yeah, the inference.

36:50.600 --> 36:52.320
Wow. Me nan's always said
there's more

36:52.320 --> 36:54.920
between heaven and Earth than
any of us ever know about.

36:54.920 --> 36:56.960
Well, I'm sure she's right.

36:56.960 --> 36:58.520
Meanwhile, back on Earth...

36:58.520 --> 37:00.440
Wow!
..CID have requested

37:00.440 --> 37:03.320
assistance with an arrest
at an address up Queensbury

37:03.320 --> 37:05.600
later this morning, to do with
that dead girl down in Elland,

37:05.600 --> 37:06.800
Mrs Bhuppal.

37:06.800 --> 37:09.680
There'll be a briefing upstairs
'round about 11 o'clock.

37:09.680 --> 37:12.120
I'll say it now and I'll say it
again before we leave.

37:12.120 --> 37:14.440
Please, please remember
your PPE. Mrs Bhuppal,

37:14.440 --> 37:15.680
what did I just say?

37:15.680 --> 37:17.280
PPE, Sarge.

37:31.360 --> 37:32.640
Fuck off.

37:57.080 --> 37:58.920
That bad, eh?

38:06.160 --> 38:09.000
So...last night...

38:10.320 --> 38:12.000
..I drank too much.

38:14.640 --> 38:15.960
Why?

38:17.160 --> 38:19.280
Because of all this about Ryan.

38:19.280 --> 38:22.280
And then...this morning,

38:22.280 --> 38:25.400
that girl who fell out
the window in Elland.

38:27.120 --> 38:29.600
She was blind
and she had got no family

38:29.600 --> 38:31.800
and she thought this bloke
were her boyfriend,

38:31.800 --> 38:33.680
and they was just using her,

38:33.680 --> 38:37.040
using her flat to stash
their filthy, shitty money in.

38:37.040 --> 38:40.000
And then t'penny must have
dropped what was going on,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.920
so they held her hostage
in her own flat,

38:42.920 --> 38:45.920
for two or three weeks,
by the sound of things.

38:45.920 --> 38:47.720
And sounded like she...

38:49.320 --> 38:51.160
Sounded like she was just
trying to escape

38:51.160 --> 38:52.240
when she fell, so...

38:53.520 --> 38:55.040
Do you want to go home?

38:55.040 --> 38:56.480
I have this thing, I get...

38:57.720 --> 38:59.080
..in here,

38:59.080 --> 39:01.880
and stuff like this with Ryan,

39:01.880 --> 39:03.760
it triggers it.

39:05.280 --> 39:06.760
It's like...

39:06.760 --> 39:09.520
..when they took me
into that garage,

39:09.520 --> 39:12.720
they'd stuffed me inside
a sleeping bag, upside down.

39:12.720 --> 39:15.120
Somebody pulled me
out of the van.

39:18.240 --> 39:20.240
And it was...him.

39:20.240 --> 39:22.280
And he goes,

39:22.280 --> 39:25.480
"Don't give me any shit,
you little bastard,

39:25.480 --> 39:28.240
"or I'll chop your tits off."

39:28.240 --> 39:30.040
So I didn't scream.

39:30.040 --> 39:31.320
And I should have screamed,

39:31.320 --> 39:33.760
I should have screamed my
fucking head off, cos if I had,

39:33.760 --> 39:35.520
then somebody might have
heard me,

39:35.520 --> 39:37.960
or they might have panicked
and made a mistake,

39:37.960 --> 39:40.560
and then none of the rest
would have happened.

39:40.560 --> 39:42.040
But I didn't...

39:42.040 --> 39:44.040
And I know
it's a survival thing

39:44.040 --> 39:46.880
and I know
I'm not a coward.

39:46.880 --> 39:49.680
So why does it play over
and over and over in here?

39:54.680 --> 39:56.160
Catherine...

39:56.160 --> 39:57.800
Well, because you're human.

39:59.720 --> 40:02.320
Because what happened
to you was horrendous.

40:03.920 --> 40:05.600
You can go home if you want.

40:05.600 --> 40:07.480
I'll speak to the DI,
he'll underst...

40:07.480 --> 40:09.480
No.
All right.

40:11.760 --> 40:13.840
I was just saying it to you.

40:15.600 --> 40:16.800
OK.

40:21.160 --> 40:23.600
What are you going to do?

40:23.600 --> 40:25.280
About Ryan?

40:25.280 --> 40:27.040
Is he still round at theirs?

40:27.040 --> 40:28.360
Yeah. He came to fetch

40:28.360 --> 40:30.840
his homework last night,
which was a tale.

40:30.840 --> 40:33.960
Never normally gives a toss
about his homework,

40:33.960 --> 40:35.760
but he's worked out that...

40:40.680 --> 40:43.440
He's worked out that
Becky took her own life.

40:44.600 --> 40:48.240
Apparently, Clare spent Saturday
evening explaining to him why -

40:48.240 --> 40:50.680
well, a version of why -
but he still wants to

40:50.680 --> 40:52.840
go and visit him.

40:52.840 --> 40:54.400
"He's still me dad."

40:56.360 --> 40:57.920
Good luck to him, eh?

41:09.040 --> 41:13.520
So, who started all this about
an alien liaison officer?

41:13.520 --> 41:18.320
Oh, Gorkem saw a strange light
moving in an erratic manner

41:18.320 --> 41:22.280
over Erringden Moor at five
o'clock yesterday morning.

41:22.280 --> 41:25.120
So then he started Googling
stuff and found out about

41:25.120 --> 41:27.280
that bobby in Todmorden
in 1980,

41:27.280 --> 41:29.600
reckoning he'd been
abducted by aliens,

41:29.600 --> 41:32.480
so now he's convinced himself
that the Earth's only days away

41:32.480 --> 41:35.120
from being overrun
by little green men.

41:35.120 --> 41:37.040
Fancy travelling all that way
through the galaxy

41:37.040 --> 41:38.400
and ending up in Todmorden.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.320
Well, you know,

41:40.320 --> 41:43.120
come all that way, you've got
to land somewhere.

41:43.120 --> 41:45.720
Yeah, but Tod? I mean,

41:45.720 --> 41:47.840
you'd just open
your capsule door,

41:47.840 --> 41:49.760
stick your antennae up
briefly,

41:49.760 --> 41:51.480
and turn around
and go home, wouldn't you?

41:51.480 --> 41:52.880
Well, I would, certainly.

41:54.480 --> 41:58.200
Anyway, I thought you'd like to
know that he's just handed in

41:58.200 --> 41:59.640
his application form to Mike.

41:59.640 --> 42:01.880
What did Mike say?

42:01.880 --> 42:03.560
I don't know.

42:03.560 --> 42:06.120
You think it's gone on
long enough?

42:06.120 --> 42:08.720
Do you think
you should tell him the truth

42:08.720 --> 42:10.680
before he makes a pillock
of himself

42:10.680 --> 42:12.200
with a member of the public?

42:12.200 --> 42:14.360
Look, it's Shaf's
jolly little jape -

42:14.360 --> 42:16.760
it's him you need to talk to,
not me.

42:18.040 --> 42:19.120
Catherine Cawood.

42:19.120 --> 42:21.880
Catherine, can we
have your team upstairs

42:21.880 --> 42:25.040
in five minutes for this
Josip Matic arrest briefing?

42:25.040 --> 42:27.080
You can indeed, sir.

42:30.840 --> 42:33.200
Upstairs now, boys and girls.

42:33.200 --> 42:34.800
Fuck's sake.

43:13.400 --> 43:14.640
Viktor's here.

43:16.880 --> 43:18.320
Hey, Viktor.

43:22.040 --> 43:26.280
The chief knows what happened
in that flat down at Elland.

43:27.640 --> 43:29.640
Oh?
It's been in the paper.

43:29.640 --> 43:31.920
He put two and two together.

43:31.920 --> 43:34.640
He says, "You think this
is how to run a business?"

43:34.640 --> 43:36.000
A woman dead,

43:36.000 --> 43:38.800
70G left behind in a flat
by a moron,

43:38.800 --> 43:40.200
and the feds all over it.

43:40.200 --> 43:41.640
Josip said she was happy.

43:41.640 --> 43:43.640
She was happy every time
we went around there.

43:43.640 --> 43:46.320
We didn't know she knew stuff
until he rang us up, panicking.

43:46.320 --> 43:47.840
You brought him in.
We didn't know

43:47.840 --> 43:50.000
the dumb bitch would try
flying out the window.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.800
You should know.
You should make it

43:51.800 --> 43:53.640
your business to know
that someone like that

43:53.640 --> 43:56.080
hasn't got it in them to try
anything that fucking stupid.

43:59.800 --> 44:01.200
And then he says,

44:01.200 --> 44:05.360
"This Josip didn't get
any of the money out?

44:05.360 --> 44:09.080
"He didn't think to take
anything with him?"

44:10.480 --> 44:11.720
He panicked.

44:15.480 --> 44:16.960
What do you want us to do?

44:19.040 --> 44:20.560
He wants Josip moved on.

44:20.560 --> 44:21.960
What...

44:21.960 --> 44:24.160
..moved on as in...?
Moved on.

44:25.680 --> 44:27.800
Before the feds get to him.

44:27.800 --> 44:29.920
He won't talk.
He's been briefed.

44:29.920 --> 44:31.640
He won't talk because you

44:31.640 --> 44:34.120
are going to pick him up
before they do.

44:34.120 --> 44:35.680
He's ditched his phone.

44:35.680 --> 44:37.760
They won't find him.
You need to go there

44:37.760 --> 44:38.920
right now. Do you think the chief

44:38.920 --> 44:40.760
will still want to come to
me wedding on Wednesday?

44:40.760 --> 44:43.680
If you sort this out.
If you don't, you'll be lucky

44:43.680 --> 44:46.040
to be at your own fucking
wedding on Wednesday.

44:47.400 --> 44:49.200
Keys.

45:36.120 --> 45:37.520
Hiya.

45:39.920 --> 45:42.040
I didn't know if you'd come.

45:42.040 --> 45:43.640
I do what I say I'll do.

45:43.640 --> 45:44.960
Like help me get a flat?

45:46.720 --> 45:48.120
First things first. I'm...

45:49.600 --> 45:51.520
I'm not in your contacts
on your phone, am I?

45:51.520 --> 45:52.880
No. Why?

45:52.880 --> 45:54.360
Just checking.

45:54.360 --> 45:56.080
And have you ever
looked the pharmacy up

45:56.080 --> 45:57.560
on your computer or anything?

45:57.560 --> 45:59.480
Why?
Because we have to make sure

45:59.480 --> 46:01.160
nobody can connect me to him.

46:01.160 --> 46:03.440
So, obviously, if they can
connect me to you,

46:03.440 --> 46:05.480
that's a connection to him.
No,

46:05.480 --> 46:06.680
I haven't. Right.

46:06.680 --> 46:08.760
So Friday night, you crush up
three diazepam...

46:08.760 --> 46:10.880
This Friday?
This Friday, and then you...

46:10.880 --> 46:12.600
Three? Three or four.

46:12.600 --> 46:13.800
Have you got enough left?

46:13.800 --> 46:15.200
No.

46:15.200 --> 46:17.400
Right. And then you put them
in his drink,

46:17.400 --> 46:19.760
whatever he's drinking,
but not the first one.

46:19.760 --> 46:22.080
Wait till he's well under way
and then do it.

46:22.080 --> 46:23.720
Will he be well under way
by 11?

46:23.720 --> 46:25.960
Yeah.
Right, well, at that time,

46:25.960 --> 46:29.320
and don't rush,
I'll be just out here, waiting.

46:29.320 --> 46:31.920
As soon as he's unconscious,
you let me in, and...

46:31.920 --> 46:33.560
..that's it. I'll do it.

46:33.560 --> 46:34.920
You'll do it?

46:34.920 --> 46:37.600
I'll inject him with thin air,
as discussed.

46:38.800 --> 46:40.360
It's a syringe.

46:40.360 --> 46:42.360
I want you to hide this
somewhere.

46:42.360 --> 46:44.520
I don't want to risk it
falling out of my pocket

46:44.520 --> 46:46.440
when I'm climbing up
that fucking wall.

46:46.440 --> 46:48.360
Somewhere handy.

46:53.960 --> 46:56.320
I'll, er, put it in here,

46:56.320 --> 46:57.800
under one of these.

46:59.200 --> 47:01.400
So, I'll do the thing.

47:01.400 --> 47:03.400
It'll take about 15 seconds.

47:03.400 --> 47:05.200
And then... Is that all?

47:05.200 --> 47:06.560
Yeah.

47:06.560 --> 47:09.160
And then we'll put him
in his car and I'll drive him

47:09.160 --> 47:11.800
into Huddersfield, and then
I'll just leave him in his car

47:11.800 --> 47:14.840
somewhere near
Great Northern Street.

47:14.840 --> 47:17.120
What about your wife?
Won't she...?

47:17.120 --> 47:18.160
No, she'll be out of it.

47:18.160 --> 47:20.320
I'll drop a bit of something
in whatever she's drinking.

47:20.320 --> 47:22.240
And then your story will be

47:22.240 --> 47:25.040
that you went to bed
at 20 past ten,

47:25.040 --> 47:27.480
and that you left him up here
drinking in front of the telly

47:27.480 --> 47:29.800
and that you had no idea
he drove into town

47:29.800 --> 47:31.360
looking for prostitutes,

47:31.360 --> 47:33.960
when the rest of the house
was asleep. Yes?

47:35.040 --> 47:37.240
Right.
And when it's done,

47:37.240 --> 47:39.560
I don't want any more contact
between us at all.

47:39.560 --> 47:40.720
Is that clear?

47:40.720 --> 47:43.280
You need more pills,
you go to your GP again.

47:43.280 --> 47:46.000
Except, you won't need any more,
because you'll be shot of him.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.640
OK?

47:48.640 --> 47:51.640
Are you... Are you sure
you want to do this? For me?

47:51.640 --> 47:54.120
Yes. But you don't mention
anything about me to the police

47:54.120 --> 47:56.720
when they come back to you
about those pills they took.

47:56.720 --> 47:58.400
Yeah?

48:00.120 --> 48:02.360
Yeah, of course.

48:06.240 --> 48:08.920
How, how will we get him
into his car?

48:11.720 --> 48:13.120
We'll manage.

48:13.120 --> 48:14.800
He weighs 13st.

48:14.800 --> 48:16.240
We'll manage between us.

48:16.240 --> 48:18.560
Dead bodies are very unwieldy.

48:18.560 --> 48:20.720
I'm sure they...
How do you know?

48:20.720 --> 48:22.840
It was on t'telly,
in this crime thing.

48:22.840 --> 48:25.520
Well, I'm stronger than I look.
So...

48:27.640 --> 48:29.560
What's funny?

48:29.560 --> 48:31.600
Just...

48:32.680 --> 48:35.000
Nothing!
Nothing's funny!

48:35.000 --> 48:37.280
I'm trying to help you, Joanna.
I know, and I'm sorry.

48:37.280 --> 48:38.840
I'm trying to find a way

48:38.840 --> 48:41.200
to solve the mess
that's been created!

48:48.280 --> 48:50.040
What's in the garage?

48:53.240 --> 48:55.040
Nothing. Stuff.

48:55.040 --> 48:56.240
Can I have a look?

48:59.200 --> 49:00.800
Erm...

49:00.800 --> 49:02.760
I need to get the...

49:02.760 --> 49:04.280
..the key.

49:08.480 --> 49:10.640
He, erm, keeps it locked.

49:11.840 --> 49:14.320
He keeps everything
fucking locked.

49:51.360 --> 49:53.600
..speed of light,
disappeared into thin air.

49:53.600 --> 49:55.120
Then there was
this other incident.

49:55.120 --> 49:56.760
This was in the 1980s.

49:56.760 --> 49:59.640
Field full of cows,
also in Todmorden.

50:06.520 --> 50:08.320
Shit.

50:08.320 --> 50:09.680
Shit! What are we going to do?

50:09.680 --> 50:11.360
Drive round the block.

50:11.360 --> 50:14.720
This whole herd disappeared
from one side of the valley

50:14.720 --> 50:16.120
to the other, overnight.

50:16.120 --> 50:18.920
And physically they just
could not have got there.

50:18.920 --> 50:20.600
It was impossible.

50:20.600 --> 50:22.200
There were fences, gates.

50:22.200 --> 50:24.560
An entire herd!
Will you shush?

50:30.520 --> 50:32.040
What are they doing?

50:32.040 --> 50:33.360
Why haven't they gone in?

50:33.360 --> 50:34.920
Who's in there with him?

50:34.920 --> 50:36.440
Who can we phone?

50:36.440 --> 50:38.640
He might have done one.
He might have gone.

50:38.640 --> 50:40.680
Yeah. Yeah,
and what if he hasn't?

50:40.680 --> 50:42.600
None of them missing,
none of them harmed.

50:42.600 --> 50:43.800
So...

50:43.800 --> 50:45.040
..how?

50:45.040 --> 50:47.160
And this is very
well-documented.

50:48.160 --> 50:50.160
I'm not disputing
what you're saying.

50:50.160 --> 50:52.880
I'm just saying,
why would they bother?

50:52.880 --> 50:55.640
Come all this way from Uranus,

50:55.640 --> 50:58.160
do you really think
they're going,

50:58.160 --> 51:01.160
"Oh, let's shift these cows.
That'll mystify everybody."

51:03.360 --> 51:05.720
Right, well, you tell me
how it happened, then.

51:05.720 --> 51:07.000
Cattle rustlers!

51:07.000 --> 51:09.240
Go, go, go.
Go, go, go. Shut up! Go!

51:28.480 --> 51:30.000
Show yourself! Police!

51:32.520 --> 51:34.320
Downstairs clear!

51:34.320 --> 51:36.160
Stay where you are!
Police!

51:36.160 --> 51:39.160
Josip Matic!
Where are you, mate?

51:43.960 --> 51:45.840
Stay where you are!

51:45.840 --> 51:48.560
Hey, get down here now.

51:48.560 --> 51:50.800
He's in the loft,
he's not coming down.

51:50.800 --> 51:52.600
All right.

51:52.600 --> 51:54.000
We're going up.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.600
Eyes peeled outside.

52:17.840 --> 52:19.880
What... What are you
looking for?

52:19.880 --> 52:21.520
I could drag him out this way.

52:21.520 --> 52:23.080
Open this door.

52:24.280 --> 52:26.680
Reverse his car in a bit.
Nobody'd see anything.

52:30.160 --> 52:31.440
Yeah. Er...

52:33.120 --> 52:34.640
Maybe we shouldn't.

52:34.640 --> 52:36.320
Shouldn't...?

52:36.320 --> 52:37.880
Do it.

52:37.880 --> 52:43.440
I know I've always said if
I don't do something to him,

52:43.440 --> 52:46.920
he'll do something to me,
but I don't...

52:46.920 --> 52:48.400
I don't think...

52:48.400 --> 52:49.840
You told him about me.

52:49.840 --> 52:51.240
It isn't just about you.

52:51.240 --> 52:53.960
You told him it was me
who gave you that diazepam.

52:53.960 --> 52:55.480
Yeah, but...

52:55.480 --> 52:57.640
All right. So, erm...

52:59.080 --> 53:01.040
I didn't.

53:01.040 --> 53:02.320
What?

53:03.840 --> 53:07.200
I lied. He...doesn't know
about you.

53:11.600 --> 53:13.040
What?!

53:13.040 --> 53:16.720
I just said that
so you'd help me, but...

53:17.960 --> 53:19.960
..he doesn't. He doesn't.

53:19.960 --> 53:22.480
So we don't have to do this.

53:23.600 --> 53:25.960
And I think it might be better

53:25.960 --> 53:28.760
if I just went back and talked
to that police lady,

53:28.760 --> 53:31.280
asked her to help me.
I won't say anything

53:31.280 --> 53:33.280
about you.
You lied?!

53:35.320 --> 53:36.680
Sorry.

53:39.920 --> 53:41.760
So we're not doing it.

53:44.200 --> 53:46.520
Do you want to?
Do I want to?

53:46.520 --> 53:47.880
No, I don't want to.

53:47.880 --> 53:50.200
I just don't want people
behaving like...

53:53.040 --> 53:54.920
So he doesn't know?

53:55.960 --> 53:58.280
No.
He definitely doesn't know?

53:58.280 --> 53:59.560
No.

54:00.600 --> 54:02.200
Are you lying?

54:02.200 --> 54:03.440
No!

54:06.120 --> 54:09.080
But is that all right?
Not doing it.

54:11.120 --> 54:13.640
Faisal!
Yeah!

54:13.640 --> 54:15.440
Yes.

54:15.440 --> 54:18.160
As long as you're not going to
keep pestering me

54:18.160 --> 54:21.240
to help you with money and
somewhere to live, if we don't.

54:23.960 --> 54:25.720
Oh, er...

54:25.720 --> 54:26.920
Oh, God.

54:28.080 --> 54:29.720
Maybe we should do it.

54:29.720 --> 54:32.280
You're a liability!
Don't say that.

54:32.280 --> 54:34.720
How do I know you're not lying?
Because I'm not lying!

54:34.720 --> 54:36.480
You lied in the first place,
saying he did!

54:36.480 --> 54:38.080
Yeah, cos I needed you
to help me.

54:38.080 --> 54:41.240
Yeah, and now you're going
to go back to your police lady
and tell her God knows what!

54:41.240 --> 54:42.960
I won't say owt about you!

54:42.960 --> 54:44.360
Oh, promise?!

54:44.360 --> 54:45.680
Fuck off.

54:45.680 --> 54:48.000
Anyway, I'm not lying,
cos if I was, don't you think

54:48.000 --> 54:49.480
he'd have knocked on
your door by now

54:49.480 --> 54:51.960
and smashed your teeth down
your fucking throat for you?

54:51.960 --> 54:53.280
And been to the police?

54:53.280 --> 54:54.440
You'd better lock that door,

54:54.440 --> 54:56.200
or he'll know you've been
in there.

55:13.520 --> 55:15.280
What's happening, Shaf?

55:15.280 --> 55:16.560
Anything? He's gone through!

55:16.560 --> 55:19.360
It's a through-er! He's gone
through to another house.

55:20.480 --> 55:22.000
Oi!

55:23.560 --> 55:25.160
Shit.

55:27.400 --> 55:29.840
Fucking shoelaces! You're under
arrest... Keep still...

55:29.840 --> 55:33.120
You're under arrest... Get off me,
you stupid bitch! Stop fucking
kicking me!

55:33.120 --> 55:35.080
Pulling my fucking pants
down!

55:35.080 --> 55:37.360
..On suspicion of
false imprisonment.

55:37.360 --> 55:39.120
Fuck you, bitch!

55:41.040 --> 55:43.360
Fuck you, buster.

55:47.120 --> 55:49.240
Man, we are fucking dead.

55:50.240 --> 55:52.240
..But it may harm your defence
if you do not mention

55:52.240 --> 55:54.120
when questioned something
you later rely on in court.

55:54.120 --> 55:56.280
Anything you do say may be
given in evidence.

55:56.280 --> 55:57.760
You're also under arrest

55:57.760 --> 55:59.920
on suspicion of
money laundering.

56:01.320 --> 56:02.640
Fucking hell.

56:05.640 --> 56:07.400
You got that, you little shit?

56:13.600 --> 56:14.680
Fuck.

56:21.680 --> 56:23.000
Catherine?

56:23.000 --> 56:26.720
- Are you all right?
- 9233, go ahead.

56:28.520 --> 56:30.160
Write that down.

57:04.080 --> 57:06.000
Hello, this is Rob,
Jo and the girls.

57:06.000 --> 57:07.520
There's no-one to take
your call at the moment,

57:07.520 --> 57:09.400
but if you'd like to leave
a message,

57:09.400 --> 57:11.360
we'll get back to you
as soon as we can.

57:11.360 --> 57:13.120
Nice one, Sarge.

57:13.120 --> 57:15.360
Hiya, Joanna.
It's Catherine Cawood

57:15.360 --> 57:17.800
from Skircoat Road
Police Station in Halifax.

57:17.800 --> 57:20.960
Er, just to say I've had the
forensic analysis report back

57:20.960 --> 57:22.480
on the pills I took from you,

57:22.480 --> 57:24.680
and I know you're not due
to answer bail

57:24.680 --> 57:26.280
for another two weeks,
but if you want to

57:26.280 --> 57:27.760
get it over and done with,
I'm on duty

57:27.760 --> 57:29.280
today until six o'clock.

57:29.280 --> 57:31.080
So give us a ring
when you get this call,

57:31.080 --> 57:32.680
let me know how you're fixed.

57:32.680 --> 57:34.120
OK, bye-bye.
