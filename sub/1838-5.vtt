11:43.300 --> 11:44.767
FREEMAN VS. CUNNINGHAM.

11:44.767 --> 11:46.734
I KNEW I GOT IT RIGHT
ON THE TEST.

11:46.734 --> 11:48.800
OH, HEY, THAT IS
INTERESTING.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.100
IT SAYS HERE IF AN APPLE
FALLS OFF YOUR TREE
INTO YOUR NEIGHBOR'S YARD

11:51.100 --> 11:54.900
AND YOU GO ON THEIR
PROPERTY TO GET IT,
IT'S STEALING.

11:54.900 --> 11:57.033
STEALING?

11:57.367 --> 12:00.300
COME ON,
IT'S JUST A MONKEY.

12:00.300 --> 12:02.200
I MEAN, APPLE.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.967
A MONKEY APPLE.

12:04.300 --> 12:05.600
THOSE LITTLE ONES.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.033
ISN'T THAT
WHAT IT'S CALLED?

12:08.033 --> 12:10.734
WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT THEY'RE CALLED.

12:10.734 --> 12:12.133
STEALING IS STEALING,

12:12.133 --> 12:14.467
AND YOU CAN GO TO JAIL
FOR IT.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.900
JAIL?

12:17.667 --> 12:20.200
MWAH. OK, WE'RE OFF
TO DO SOME SHOPPING.

12:20.200 --> 12:23.133
THIS WAY, COUNSELOR.

12:23.133 --> 12:25.367
"MONKEY APPLE."

12:26.300 --> 12:27.800
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

12:27.800 --> 12:29.300
YOU SEEM
A LITTLE NERVOUS.

12:29.300 --> 12:32.000
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU TALKING' ABOUT.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.600
REALLY? WELL, UM...

12:35.600 --> 12:39.734
YOU CAN'T SLEEP,
UH, YOU GET NIGHTMARES.

12:39.734 --> 12:42.467
YA KNOW, YOU'RE
JUST A LITTLE BIT JUMPY!

12:42.467 --> 12:43.300
I AM NOT!

12:43.300 --> 12:47.467
HMM. COREY,
WHATEVER IT IS
YOU DID, MAN,

12:47.467 --> 12:49.400
YOU CAN TELL ME.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.600
[SIGHS]

12:51.600 --> 12:54.000
I--I DON'T KNOW.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.667
LISTEN, COREY,

12:55.667 --> 12:58.000
I AM YOUR BIG SISTER, OK?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.467
I WON'T JUDGE YOU.

12:59.467 --> 13:02.033
OK. YOU KNOW THAT
MONKEY KEY CHAIN?

13:02.033 --> 13:04.400
MM-HMM.
I STOLE IT.

13:04.400 --> 13:05.967
YOU DIRTY, LITTLE THIEF!

13:05.967 --> 13:08.567
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WEREN'T GONNA JUDGE ME!

13:08.567 --> 13:12.600
THAT WAS BEFORE I KNEW
YOU WERE ON A CRIME SPREE!

13:12.600 --> 13:14.567
BUT IT'S JUST ONE,
LITTLE KEY CHAIN!

13:14.567 --> 13:16.400
YOU HEARD MOM, COREY!

13:16.400 --> 13:17.600
STEALING IS STEALING!

13:17.600 --> 13:19.400
YOU COULD GO TO JAIL!

13:19.400 --> 13:21.400
I KNOW, I KNOW.
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

13:21.400 --> 13:25.300
I HAVE TO GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS, MAN,

13:25.300 --> 13:30.867
SO WHATEVER IT IS,
I'LL UNDERSTAND.

13:30.867 --> 13:32.867
WELL, ALL THE OTHER KIDS
WERE DOING IT.

13:32.867 --> 13:34.834
YOU SPINELESS,
LITTLE PUNK.

13:34.834 --> 13:36.600
YOU JUST SAID
YOU'D UNDERSTAND.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.967
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M SORRY. THAT WAS MY BAD.

13:38.967 --> 13:39.567
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

13:39.567 --> 13:42.567
RAVEN, PLEASE DON'T TELL
MOM AND DAD. PLEASE.

13:42.567 --> 13:44.500
I PROMISE, I'LL
RETURN IT RIGHT NOW

13:44.500 --> 13:46.367
AND I'LL NEVER
STEAL AGAIN.

13:46.367 --> 13:47.734
OK.

13:47.734 --> 13:49.300
THANK YOU.

13:52.567 --> 13:56.467
OK, YOU ALL SAW HIM,
RIGHT?

13:56.467 --> 13:59.767
YES, CHELSEA.

13:59.767 --> 14:03.033
RAY DID YOU KNOW
IT'S YOUR FIRST DAY
WITH THE PRIZE?

14:03.033 --> 14:04.233
YOU ARE
GONNA LOVE IT!

14:04.233 --> 14:05.667
I CAN'T WAIT!

14:05.667 --> 14:07.133
IT'S WAITIN' RIGHT
OUTSIDE FOR YOU, RAY.

14:07.133 --> 14:08.867
I HOPE IT'S AS
CHARGED UP AS I AM.

14:08.867 --> 14:10.667
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M GONNA
HAVE VERY FIRST DAY

14:10.667 --> 14:12.900
WITH MY VERY OWN--

14:15.400 --> 14:17.400
GOT YOU!

14:20.767 --> 14:22.300
OH, MY GOODNESS!

14:22.300 --> 14:23.033
COREY'S
GONNA STEAL AGAIN.

14:23.033 --> 14:25.100
HE'S GONNA MAKE
THE BIGGEST MISTAKE
OF HIS LIFE.

14:25.100 --> 14:26.967
I GOTTA STOP HIM!

14:26.967 --> 14:29.967
OH, HEY, YOU GUYS KEEP
AN EYE ON THE PRIZE
WHILE I'M GONE.

14:29.967 --> 14:33.967
OH, LOOK AT IT.
IT'S MOVING.

14:33.967 --> 14:35.600
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHERE'S IT GOIN'?

14:35.600 --> 14:40.200
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT IT'S GETTIN' AWAY.
GO, GO, GO!

15:05.233 --> 15:07.500
WAY TO GO, COREY.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.133
YO, COREY.

15:10.133 --> 15:13.567
HEY, BACK FOR ANOTHER
5-FINGER DISCOUNT?

15:13.567 --> 15:15.233
SAY WHAT?

15:15.233 --> 15:18.100
UH, ACTUALLY,
I WAS JUST LEAVING.

15:18.100 --> 15:20.100
THERE'S NOTHING HERE
WORTH STEALING.

15:20.100 --> 15:22.200
HEY, MAN, THAT'S NOT
WHAT WE THINK.

15:22.200 --> 15:25.000
HEY, GUYS, DO YOUR THING.

15:27.100 --> 15:30.500
OH, DUDE, CHECK OUT
THESE NEW WATCHES.

15:31.700 --> 15:33.400
YEAH, THEY'RE OK...

15:33.600 --> 15:35.600
BUT I DON'T REALLY CARE
WHAT TIME IT IS.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.467
I LIKE TO LIVE
IN THE MOMENT.

15:37.467 --> 15:38.767
WELL, THE MOMENT IS HERE.

15:38.767 --> 15:41.600
SEE THAT SECURITY GUARD
OVER THERE?

15:41.600 --> 15:42.867
HE'S GOIN' OFF DUTY,

15:42.867 --> 15:47.667
AND THE NEXT GUY
WON'T COME IN FOR
ANOTHER 10 MINUTES.

15:55.567 --> 16:00.734
WHOA! YOU GOT IT ALL
FIGURED OUT.

16:00.734 --> 16:02.867
WELL, GOOD LUCK.

16:02.867 --> 16:06.000
MAN, COREY...

16:06.000 --> 16:07.400
FOR ABOUT A DAY THERE,

16:07.400 --> 16:09.834
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT
YOU WERE COOL.

16:09.834 --> 16:10.767
I AM COOL.

16:10.767 --> 16:13.400
I'M COOLER
THAN COOL.

16:13.400 --> 16:15.567
I'M ICE COLD!

16:15.567 --> 16:17.900
OH, YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR.

16:17.900 --> 16:19.867
SAY IT LOUD!

16:19.867 --> 16:21.834
UH-UH, OH, NO, GIRL.

16:21.834 --> 16:24.767
I AM NOT LETTING
THIS VISION COME TRUE.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.100
SORRY, MA'AM.

16:32.100 --> 16:34.233
IT'S JUST A LONER.

16:37.300 --> 16:38.934
COREY, IF YOU DON'T
DO THIS WITH US,

16:38.934 --> 16:40.500
WE'RE GONNA TELL
EVERYBODY AT SCHOOL

16:40.500 --> 16:42.700
THAT YOU LIKE TO
TAKE BUBBLE BATHS.

16:42.700 --> 16:44.600
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

16:44.600 --> 16:46.467
YOU DO?

16:46.467 --> 16:48.133
I WAS JUST FISHIN',

16:48.133 --> 16:50.133
AND I CAUGHT A SUCKER!

16:50.133 --> 16:52.500
HOOK, LINE, AND SINKER.

16:52.934 --> 16:53.800
YOU KNOW WHAT, DARRYL?

16:53.800 --> 16:55.800
YOU CAN CALL ME
ANYTHING YOU WANT,

16:55.800 --> 16:58.567
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU CAN'T CALL ME?

16:58.567 --> 17:00.066
A THIEF.

17:00.867 --> 17:02.600
YOU STOLE THAT KEY CHAIN.

17:02.600 --> 17:03.934
I PUT IT BACK.

17:03.934 --> 17:07.033
MAN, YOU REALLY
ARE A SUCKER.

17:07.033 --> 17:09.600
WATCH THIS.

17:10.967 --> 17:12.700
MAN, GIMME THIS.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:12.700 --> 17:14.300
MAN, THIS IS NOT COOL!

17:14.300 --> 17:16.100
[DEEP VOICE]
GOT YOU!

17:17.600 --> 17:21.033
WELL, WELL...WELL...

17:21.033 --> 17:24.600
LOOK WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE.

17:24.600 --> 17:26.400
COREY, SHAME ON YOU.

17:26.400 --> 17:28.734
COME ON, GUYS,
WE SHOULDN'T BE
HANGING AROUND

17:28.734 --> 17:30.400
WITH SUCH A BAD
INFLUENCE LIKE HIM.

17:30.400 --> 17:34.300
WHOA, WHOA! HOLD--
HOLD--HOLD IT!

17:34.300 --> 17:35.500
NO ONE'S GOIN' ANYWHERE

17:35.500 --> 17:42.100
'CAUSE TO ME, LOOKS LIKE
WE GOT A LITTLE SIT-I-A-TION
ON OUR HANDS.

17:42.100 --> 17:45.000
UH, OFFICER "BUCK,"

17:45.000 --> 17:46.500
CAN I SPEAK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

17:46.500 --> 17:47.133
'COURSE YOU CAN, SON.

17:47.133 --> 17:48.734
JUST STEP OVER THERE.
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.400
LET ME TAKE CARE
OF THESE FELLERS OVER HERE.

17:52.967 --> 17:53.567

GETS HURT, ALL RIGHT?!

17:57.200 --> 17:59.700
GOOD,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:59.700 --> 18:00.400
JUST TO LET Y'ALL KNOW,

18:00.400 --> 18:02.400
I GOT EACH OF YOUR FACES

18:02.400 --> 18:08.100
I GOT WHAT YOU CALL
A PHOTO-TAKIN' MEMORY.

DOING HERE?

18:20.000 --> 18:21.467
I PUT THE KEY CHAIN BACK.

18:21.467 --> 18:22.734
WHAT ABOUT THE WATCH?

18:22.734 --> 18:25.834
I WAS TRYING TO STOP
DARRYL FROM STEALING IT.

18:25.834 --> 18:27.200
I'M NOT A THIEF, RAVEN.

18:27.200 --> 18:31.300
SO YOU MEAN TO SAY
THAT THE SECURITY GUARD
IN MY VISION

18:31.300 --> 18:32.667
WAS ACTUALLY ME?

18:32.667 --> 18:35.734
YEAH, THAT'S A NEW
TWIST ON THINGS.

18:35.734 --> 18:36.500
WHO CARES?

18:36.500 --> 18:39.500
LET'S JUST GET OUT
OF HERE BEFORE WE BOTH
GET IN TROUBLE.

18:39.500 --> 18:41.233
TRUE, THAT.

18:41.800 --> 18:46.000
ALL RIGHT, SON,
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

I, TOO, AM A
SECURITY...UH...

THAT UNIFORM'S
PRETTY BIG ON YOU.

19:05.200 --> 19:10.000

THAT NEW LOW-CARB DIET.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.400
OK, WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE?

19:12.400 --> 19:14.700
UH...UH...WHAT...

19:14.700 --> 19:15.667

19:15.667 --> 19:17.734
IS IT A 402, 706?

19:17.734 --> 19:21.133
I'D SAY WE HAVE A 903
ON OUR HANDS.

19:21.133 --> 19:22.900
WHAT?! A SWARM OF BEES?!

19:22.900 --> 19:24.700
OH, NO, NOT A SWARM!
NOT A SWARM!

19:24.700 --> 19:28.867
EH, WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN--
I DIDN'T--OOH.

19:29.367 --> 19:33.100
OFFICER, COREY WAS
THE ONE WHO WAS
SHOPLIFTIN'.

19:33.100 --> 19:35.400
SHOPLIFTING?

19:35.400 --> 19:36.467
UH, WHAT DO WE CALL THAT?

19:36.467 --> 19:38.400
WE JUST CALL IT
SHOPLIFTIN'.

19:38.400 --> 19:39.934
I KNEW THAT.

19:39.934 --> 19:41.500
OK, YOU KIDS,
EMPTY YOUR POCKETS.

19:41.500 --> 19:43.900
YOU HEARD THE MAN--
I MEAN, THE WOMAN.

19:43.900 --> 19:46.467
YOU'RE SO STRONG,
SO AUTHORITATIVE.

19:56.567 --> 19:59.767
SEE, WELL, THIS ONE
IS INNOCENT.

19:59.767 --> 20:02.000
OK, YOU CAN GO.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.400
THE REST OF YOU...

20:03.400 --> 20:05.800
WE'RE CALLING YOUR PARENTS.

20:05.800 --> 20:08.867
YOU GUYS ARE IN
SERIOUS TROUBLE.

20:08.867 --> 20:11.900
SERIOUS TROUBLE!

20:12.600 --> 20:13.600
ALL RIGHT, WATSON,

20:13.600 --> 20:19.200
I'LL ESCORT THIS ONE
OFF THE PREMISES.
GOOD JOB, THERE.

20:21.467 --> 20:24.700
[NORMAL VOICE]
COREY, I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SAY THIS,

20:24.700 --> 20:26.500
BUT I AM SO PROUD
OF YOU.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.200
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SAY THIS:

20:28.200 --> 20:29.934
THANKS FOR HAVIN' MY BACK.

20:29.934 --> 20:31.567
[WHISPERS]
No problem.

20:31.567 --> 20:32.567
OH, WAIT.

20:32.567 --> 20:33.367
I FORGOT.

20:33.367 --> 20:35.300
I DIDN'T PAY
FOR THESE.

20:35.934 --> 20:40.100
OW! OHH
YEP, THAT WAS A 1027:

20:40.100 --> 20:43.734
MUSTACHE BURN. OW!

21:12.867 --> 21:15.767
HEY, HEY, HEY. I CAN'T
TELL HER WHAT HAPPENED.

21:15.767 --> 21:17.600
IT WAS TOO HORRIBLE.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.767
[SOBS]
OH, WHAT HAPPENED?

21:19.767 --> 21:22.967
AW, MAN. YOU GOT IT WET,
DIDN'T YOU?

21:22.967 --> 21:24.300
WELL, IT LOOKED THIRSTY.

21:24.300 --> 21:26.133
IT DOESN'T DRINK,
CHELSE.

21:26.133 --> 21:29.600
UH, WELL, NOW IT
DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.300
[GASPS]

21:31.300 --> 21:32.767
MAYBE WE SHOULD
BURY IT.

21:32.767 --> 21:34.600
MAYBE WE SHOULD
SELL IT FOR PARTS.

21:34.600 --> 21:39.934
MAN, I DIDN'T GET
2 SECONDS WITH IT.

21:39.934 --> 21:42.900
WELL, UH, RAY, WE TOOK
A PICTURE WITH IT.

21:42.900 --> 21:45.300
IF YOU WANT IT,
IT'S YOURS.

21:45.300 --> 21:47.300
I CAN'T SEE THE THING.

21:47.300 --> 21:49.367
SOMEONE'S THUMB
IS IN THE LENS.

21:49.367 --> 21:53.667
YEAH, BUT RAY, LOOK
HOW HAPPY WE LOOK.
