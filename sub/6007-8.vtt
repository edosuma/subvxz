WEBVTT

00:02.356 --> 00:04.356
The year is 2048.

00:04.358 --> 00:07.159
Evolving technologies can
no longer be regulated.

00:07.161 --> 00:11.764
Dangerous advancements forever
alter the criminal landscape.

00:11.766 --> 00:15.034
Police are not prepared.

00:15.036 --> 00:17.436
Law enforcement combats this corruption

00:17.438 --> 00:21.039
with a new line of defense.

00:21.041 --> 00:24.142
But not all are created equal.

00:26.446 --> 00:29.781
The idea behind the DRNs was
to be as human as possible.

00:29.783 --> 00:32.183
They were based on a program
called Synthetic Soul.

00:32.186 --> 00:33.452
That's one of the crazy ones.

00:33.454 --> 00:35.320
- I'll lead you in?
- Let's go.

00:35.322 --> 00:37.055
Now all cops...

00:37.057 --> 00:39.791
human and manmade together...

00:39.793 --> 00:42.093
take on the battle to watch over us all.

01:04.916 --> 01:06.150
Hey, hey. We're not open yet.

01:06.152 --> 01:07.418
But you gotta let me in, please!

01:07.420 --> 01:09.419
Ten minutes!

01:10.755 --> 01:12.155
Hey, what's wrong with you?

01:21.734 --> 01:23.900
Hey! Stop right there!

01:29.806 --> 01:31.341
Hey!

01:31.343 --> 01:33.343
Hey! Hey!

01:35.312 --> 01:39.149
Sir, come here.

01:39.151 --> 01:41.017
- Sir, I'm only gonna say this once...
- No, please!

01:41.019 --> 01:42.417
- Sir!
- Please, they're gonna... they're gonna find me!

01:42.419 --> 01:43.919
- Who's gonna find you?
- They know where I am!

01:43.921 --> 01:45.320
- Calm down!
- They're gonna kill me!

01:45.322 --> 01:47.023
- You don't understand!
- Calm down, sir!

02:00.203 --> 02:01.883
Please enjoy a hot beverage.

02:02.972 --> 02:06.708
When you came to see me six months ago,

02:06.710 --> 02:09.244
your emotions were boiling over with hate.

02:09.246 --> 02:11.813
You were seething with frustration

02:11.815 --> 02:14.349
and disgust at your neighbors,

02:14.351 --> 02:15.349
at your fellow workers,

02:15.351 --> 02:16.450
at our government.

02:16.452 --> 02:18.452
But today...

02:18.454 --> 02:20.388
you are a different man.

02:21.991 --> 02:24.059
And I am so proud

02:24.061 --> 02:25.426
of how far you've come.

02:27.396 --> 02:30.732
What a complete and utter waste of my time.

02:33.001 --> 02:34.768
I could not feel worse.

02:34.770 --> 02:36.170
I don't feel at all better.

02:36.172 --> 02:38.872
I hate everyone the same.

02:38.874 --> 02:41.141
In fact, I think I hate you most.

02:41.143 --> 02:42.276
Okay.

02:42.278 --> 02:43.277
But, Jim...

02:43.279 --> 02:44.378
listen to yourself.

02:44.380 --> 02:45.446
Listen to your words.

02:45.448 --> 02:47.147
Two months ago, you would've been

02:47.149 --> 02:48.281
expressing this anger physically.

02:48.283 --> 02:51.418
Now you're using your words.

02:51.420 --> 02:53.754
When I get these damn bandages off,

02:53.756 --> 02:55.455
I'll be physical again.

02:55.457 --> 02:57.024
Well, you should be proud of yourself.

02:57.026 --> 02:59.159
Okay, John. What about you?

02:59.161 --> 03:00.427
How are you feeling?

03:00.429 --> 03:02.262
Doc, I'm feeling great.

03:02.264 --> 03:03.764
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:03.766 --> 03:05.164
I'm feeling really good.

03:05.166 --> 03:07.100
I don't want to encourage you to be angry,

03:07.102 --> 03:09.236
but I also don't want
you to hide your feelings

03:09.238 --> 03:12.138
from us... and more importantly...

03:12.140 --> 03:13.139
from yourself.

03:13.141 --> 03:14.374
No, uh, look...

03:14.376 --> 03:15.975
I'm the first to agree, you know?

03:15.977 --> 03:18.245
I'm all for sharing feelings.

03:18.247 --> 03:19.912
Uh... but, uh...

03:19.914 --> 03:20.913
I feel good.

03:20.915 --> 03:22.014
What can I say?

03:22.016 --> 03:23.182
John...

03:23.184 --> 03:25.885
your girlfriend not only abandoned you,

03:25.887 --> 03:28.721
- but she was secretly working for
one of the most...
- Yeah.

03:28.723 --> 03:30.857
Infamous criminal
organizations in this city.

03:30.859 --> 03:32.424
The same organization that targeted

03:32.426 --> 03:34.026
and killed your entire squad...

03:34.028 --> 03:36.729
in a gun battle and left you for dead,

03:36.731 --> 03:37.730
and, ultimately,

03:37.732 --> 03:39.931
left you with a synthetic leg.

03:39.933 --> 03:42.000
Yet, for the past several sessions,

03:42.002 --> 03:43.902
in what little you've told us,

03:43.904 --> 03:46.104
you're saying that...

03:46.106 --> 03:48.006
you have no problems

03:48.008 --> 03:50.208
and you... feel good?

03:50.210 --> 03:53.211
Are you really, truly saying

03:53.213 --> 03:54.279
that you're being honest?

03:54.281 --> 03:56.014
Look, Doc,

03:56.016 --> 03:57.382
we all hit bumps in the road.

03:57.384 --> 03:58.449
You know?

03:58.451 --> 04:00.485
Everyone hits speed bumps, right?

04:00.487 --> 04:01.820
The thing is,

04:01.822 --> 04:03.221
I got my health, you know?

04:03.223 --> 04:04.956
I got a job.

04:04.958 --> 04:06.424
I got a new synthetic leg.

04:06.426 --> 04:09.161
I can still... you know.

04:09.163 --> 04:11.962
Comparatively speaking...

04:11.964 --> 04:14.399
I mean, I'm not like...
like Marty over there.

04:14.401 --> 04:16.233
I mean, no... no offense, Marty.

04:16.235 --> 04:17.435
If I was in your shoes,

04:17.437 --> 04:19.470
pal, I tell you, I'd...

04:19.471 --> 04:21.372
I'd really... , you know?

04:21.374 --> 04:23.841
Every week I walk in
here, I think, "Oh, my God,

04:23.843 --> 04:25.009
is Marty gonna be here?"

04:25.011 --> 04:26.711
And he is. Week in, week out.

04:26.713 --> 04:27.912
I gotta hand it to you.

04:27.914 --> 04:30.014
I'd get a divorce, I'd put the dog down,

04:30.016 --> 04:32.183
and I'd just stay away from peanut butter.

04:32.185 --> 04:33.984
It's as simple as that, really.

04:33.986 --> 04:34.985
I feel good.

04:34.987 --> 04:36.453
I really do, you know?

04:36.455 --> 04:39.356
What about you, uh... Anal?

04:39.358 --> 04:40.390
You're good?

04:40.392 --> 04:41.391
It's Aneal.

04:41.393 --> 04:43.127
Okay. Yeah.

04:46.822 --> 04:47.855
Hey, Mr. Friendly.

04:47.857 --> 04:49.190
How was Angry Class 101?

04:49.192 --> 04:50.725
Call me that again and I swear

04:50.727 --> 04:52.727
I'll stick my boot right in your face.

04:52.729 --> 04:54.829
Clearly, it went well.

05:05.841 --> 05:07.041
Detective Kennex.

05:07.043 --> 05:08.709
Here's the preliminary report.

05:08.711 --> 05:10.044
Detective Paul is up there, sir.

05:10.046 --> 05:12.113
Oh, I'm sorry, there's not
much we can do about that.

05:15.117 --> 05:16.883
Victim is Anton Cross.

05:16.885 --> 05:18.251
Lived in Lakeshore Heights.

05:18.253 --> 05:21.188
Single gunshot wound to the upper torso.

05:21.190 --> 05:22.656
Large caliber round.

05:22.658 --> 05:25.192
What do you got?

05:25.194 --> 05:27.728
Looks like three shots fired.

05:27.730 --> 05:29.062
One through the skylight,

05:29.064 --> 05:30.331
one through that guy's celo,

05:30.333 --> 05:31.699
and one into Mr. Lucky here,

05:31.701 --> 05:33.700
which fragmented on the wall.

05:33.702 --> 05:36.136
The transit police said he was running.

05:36.138 --> 05:38.205
They stopped him on the platform.

05:38.207 --> 05:40.140
He was agitated, saying
"They're gonna kill me."

05:40.142 --> 05:42.075
Three shots and no one saw a shooter?

05:42.077 --> 05:43.076
Correct.

05:43.078 --> 05:44.845
And we only recovered one bullet.

05:44.847 --> 05:45.846
One bullet?

05:45.848 --> 05:46.947
It is possible that

05:46.949 --> 05:48.381
a single bullet was responsible

05:48.383 --> 05:49.816
for all three impacts.

05:49.818 --> 05:52.084
If fired from the perfect angle

05:52.086 --> 05:54.086
and traveling along a
consistent trajectory,

05:54.088 --> 05:55.722
I believe a bullet could
have cut through the skylight,

05:55.724 --> 05:56.823
continued through the celo,
bounced against the wall,

05:56.825 --> 05:57.990
ricocheted to the floor,

05:57.992 --> 06:00.259
and penetrated the victim's chest cavity.

06:02.880 --> 06:04.947
Let me get this straight.

06:04.949 --> 06:06.982
You're suggesting that a single bullet

06:06.984 --> 06:08.117
came through the skylight,

06:08.119 --> 06:09.851
ricocheted and bounced its way

06:09.853 --> 06:11.220
through the subway, and then just

06:11.222 --> 06:14.023
miraculously hit a man
square in the chest...

06:14.025 --> 06:16.225
who was, according to witnesses,

06:16.227 --> 06:17.960
running, screaming,

06:17.962 --> 06:19.861
"They're gonna kill me"?

06:19.863 --> 06:22.097
While the likelihood seems improbable,

06:22.099 --> 06:24.733
there is a .004% chance that a shooter

06:24.735 --> 06:25.734
firing with this morning's

06:25.736 --> 06:27.035
five miles per hour northwesterly winds,

06:27.037 --> 06:28.904
would release a bullet that
would only increase speed

06:28.906 --> 06:30.171
until hitting the skylight,

06:30.173 --> 06:32.006
where the trajectory would change nominally

06:32.008 --> 06:33.241
and the bullet would increase velocity

06:33.243 --> 06:34.375
due to air conditioning within the station.

06:34.377 --> 06:36.711
A temporary deformation,
coupled with inertia

06:36.713 --> 06:37.979
and the molecular structure of the wall,

06:37.981 --> 06:40.048
the celo, and the floor,
would inevitably allow

06:40.050 --> 06:42.016
for a fatal impact.

06:43.386 --> 06:45.119
Makes sense to me.

06:49.024 --> 06:50.791
What do you think?

06:50.793 --> 06:52.060
Obviously, this is just a first look,

06:52.062 --> 06:53.261
but it appears that there's only

06:53.263 --> 06:54.862
residue from the skylight,

06:54.864 --> 06:56.330
and residue from the celo.

06:56.332 --> 06:58.866
Yet there's no residue from the floor,

06:58.868 --> 07:00.133
making the likelihood that it bounced

07:00.135 --> 07:01.134
or ricocheted unlikely.

07:01.136 --> 07:02.202
Detective Kennex.

07:02.204 --> 07:04.839
I appreciate you seeking multiple scenarios

07:04.841 --> 07:06.073
as to how this homicide occurred.

07:06.075 --> 07:07.407
And I understand your partner
is trying to assist you.

07:07.409 --> 07:09.343
However, I must remind you that

07:09.345 --> 07:10.744
your partner is a DRN.

07:10.746 --> 07:12.079
A discontinued...

07:12.081 --> 07:13.947
Please, do continue.

07:13.949 --> 07:15.949
If you look here, there seems to be

07:15.951 --> 07:17.750
some sort of circuitry
that's embedded in the slug.

07:17.752 --> 07:21.221
Now, we can't be sure until
we a get a full analysis,

07:21.223 --> 07:22.689
but these markings don't look like

07:22.691 --> 07:24.291
scratches from a bullet hitting a wall.

07:24.293 --> 07:27.833
Again, Detective Kennex,
your DRN is inferior.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.152
- Its computing power is 18 billion trilihertz
- It's not something you see every day.

07:30.155 --> 07:30.964
- less than my own.
- On top of that, I genuinely believe

07:30.966 --> 07:32.298
- that one bullet did do...
- It does not have the ability

07:32.300 --> 07:33.700
- all of this damage.
- ... to rationalize, analyze or deduct.

07:33.702 --> 07:35.234
- His intelligence is subpar...
- Just not a ricochet,

07:35.236 --> 07:36.903
- as suggested by...
- You are damaging your incident arrest quota

07:36.905 --> 07:38.838
- Detective Paul's MX.
- ... by having an obsolete DRN.

07:38.840 --> 07:40.840
You are continuing to listen
to a retired old system,

07:40.842 --> 07:42.842
believing the rambling
and illogical theories

07:42.844 --> 07:44.010
of your appropriately canceled partner.

07:44.012 --> 07:45.378
If you would like,

07:45.380 --> 07:46.845
I can put in a request

07:55.848 --> 07:57.382
Are you out of your mind?

07:57.384 --> 07:58.383
You do not draw your weapon...

07:58.385 --> 08:01.419
let alone fire it in a public place

08:01.421 --> 08:02.986
unless you're in danger!

08:02.988 --> 08:04.054
Doesn't fire his weapon?

08:04.056 --> 08:05.322
Who cares about him firing his weapon?

08:05.324 --> 08:07.157
He's firing it at my MX!

08:07.159 --> 08:09.427
Come on. Since when do
you care about an MX?

08:09.429 --> 08:11.929
What if I put a bullet in Dorian's head?

08:11.931 --> 08:13.397
- Hey. Hey!
- Don't even look at Dorian!

08:13.399 --> 08:16.233
Nobody is shooting any police officers.

08:16.235 --> 08:17.401
Let me explain something to you.

08:17.403 --> 08:19.202
I'm a police officer.

08:19.204 --> 08:20.337
You're a police officer.

08:20.339 --> 08:22.039
And as much as it pains me to say it,

08:22.041 --> 08:24.441
Richard is a police officer.

08:24.443 --> 08:26.743
Now, you can dress these
machines to look like cops.

08:26.745 --> 08:28.946
You can program 'em to drive a car

08:28.948 --> 08:30.780
and shoot a gun like a cop.

08:30.782 --> 08:33.116
But they're not cops.

08:33.118 --> 08:34.951
They're bullet catchers.

08:34.953 --> 08:38.220
And if you force me to
work with a faulty machine,

08:38.222 --> 08:39.522
then I will dispose of it

08:39.524 --> 08:41.057
with the same degree of compassion

08:41.058 --> 08:43.927
that I would a toaster that burns my toast.

08:43.929 --> 08:45.495
John, I don't know what to do with you.

08:45.497 --> 08:47.096
I could give you a list
of things I'd do with him.

08:47.098 --> 08:48.197
Richard, let me handle this.

08:48.199 --> 08:49.899
Wow.

08:51.068 --> 08:53.269
You better watch your ass.

08:54.744 --> 08:56.305
Your partner better watch his ass, too.

08:56.307 --> 09:00.209
Richard, go down and
find yourself another MX.

09:06.916 --> 09:08.450
We've got a problem here, John.

09:08.452 --> 09:10.018
Yeah, I agree.

09:10.180 --> 09:12.180
I mean, what do you think
he wants to do to my ass?

09:12.182 --> 09:14.016
You know, your anger
issues and your short fuse

09:14.018 --> 09:15.283
are known way beyond this precinct.

09:15.285 --> 09:17.418
You were supposed to
participate in therapy.

09:17.420 --> 09:19.021
I'm participating.

09:19.023 --> 09:20.355
And it's working.

09:20.357 --> 09:23.324
It was just a minor slip, okay?

09:23.326 --> 09:24.925
It could've been worse.

09:24.927 --> 09:26.194
I mean, I could've shot Richard.

09:27.964 --> 09:30.965
I understand Dorian found
the victim's girlfriend.

09:30.967 --> 09:32.066
Get into that.

09:32.068 --> 09:33.108
See what you can find out.

09:46.581 --> 09:48.315
Name: Kira Larsen.

09:48.317 --> 09:52.352
1,003 communications with Anton Cross

09:52.354 --> 09:54.922
in the last 12-week period.

09:54.924 --> 09:56.290
Where does she work?

09:56.292 --> 09:57.924
Trope Software.

09:57.926 --> 10:00.327
That's the same as Anton Cross.

10:00.329 --> 10:02.262
Affirmative.

10:02.264 --> 10:04.398
They work together.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.333
Address, please.

10:15.943 --> 10:16.943
What?

10:16.945 --> 10:18.211
You like me.

10:18.213 --> 10:19.478
- Sorry?
- You like me.

10:19.480 --> 10:20.413
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

10:20.415 --> 10:21.681
- No.
- You definitely do.

10:21.683 --> 10:23.016
How do you come by that conclusion?

10:23.018 --> 10:24.984
The MX. You shot it because

10:24.986 --> 10:27.087
- it insulted me. You like me.
- No.

10:27.089 --> 10:28.521
- I shot the MX 'cause it wouldn't shut up.
- Nope.

10:28.523 --> 10:30.256
You shot it because you like me.

10:30.258 --> 10:31.357
Keep talking, I'll prove my point.

10:31.359 --> 10:32.358
It's okay, John.

10:32.360 --> 10:33.992
I like you, too.

10:37.532 --> 10:38.698
Rudy, what's up?

10:38.700 --> 10:40.600
Uh, well, you were right, Dorian.

10:40.602 --> 10:43.536
There is a power source in this bullet.

10:43.538 --> 10:45.571
There are definitely, uh,

10:45.573 --> 10:48.107
micro-electro-mechanical systems embedded

10:48.109 --> 10:49.975
in... in the bullets.

10:49.977 --> 10:51.576
Um, active aerodynamics, which can alter

10:51.578 --> 10:53.511
the course of the bullets in flight.

10:53.513 --> 10:55.080
I've never seen anything like it.

10:55.082 --> 10:57.415
Do we have any idea who might've made it

10:57.417 --> 10:59.118
or where it was manufactured?

10:59.120 --> 11:00.953
Not yet, but the MEMS circuits

11:00.955 --> 11:03.222
are highly specialized.

11:03.224 --> 11:06.124
Whoever fires this can
control where this bullet goes.

11:06.126 --> 11:09.193
It could literally chase
you around a corner.

11:09.195 --> 11:11.095
If the shooter wants you dead,

11:11.097 --> 11:13.097
the bullet will find you.

11:30.415 --> 11:31.482
Hi.

11:31.484 --> 11:33.550
We need to speak to Kira Larsen.

11:33.552 --> 11:35.052
Just one moment, Officer.

11:41.593 --> 11:43.427
I'm Kira Larsen. What's this about?

11:43.429 --> 11:45.162
I'm Detective John Kennex.

11:45.164 --> 11:47.665
I'm afraid we have some very bad news.

11:51.369 --> 11:53.170
I don't...

11:53.172 --> 11:55.305
Anton would never hurt anyone in his life.

11:55.307 --> 11:57.307
Who would want to hurt him?

11:57.309 --> 11:59.375
Was he involved in any
underground activities?

11:59.377 --> 12:00.543
Black market, drugs?

12:00.545 --> 12:01.577
Did he owe any money?

12:01.579 --> 12:02.578
No.

12:02.580 --> 12:04.314
Black market?

12:04.316 --> 12:06.316
Anton was a gamer.

12:06.318 --> 12:09.385
He was an elder in Warriors of Grun.

12:09.387 --> 12:11.921
We're trying to find out information

12:11.923 --> 12:14.223
about the weapon he was killed with.

12:14.225 --> 12:17.960
When was the last time you heard from him?

12:17.962 --> 12:19.295
Uh, he left me a message.

12:19.297 --> 12:21.331
- When?
- Last night.

12:23.367 --> 12:26.335
Hey, K. You must be asleep.

12:26.337 --> 12:29.438
Uh, of course you are. Anyway, um,

12:29.440 --> 12:32.407
forget looking for the
bio-stamp on the, uh...

12:32.409 --> 12:34.509
on the 318 liquifile.

12:34.511 --> 12:35.577
I found it.

12:35.579 --> 12:36.946
It's on my arm.

12:36.948 --> 12:39.614
Anyway, uh...

12:39.616 --> 12:43.017
uh, I got to go.

12:43.019 --> 12:44.285
Love you.

12:44.287 --> 12:45.954
See you tomorrow.

12:49.225 --> 12:50.959
He seems distracted.

12:50.961 --> 12:53.094
Oh, he's... he's working. That's how

12:53.096 --> 12:54.363
he always is.

13:03.038 --> 13:06.274
I'm gonna need access to
all of Anton's office files.

13:06.276 --> 13:07.541
Of course.

13:07.543 --> 13:11.012
I can take care of that right now.

13:11.099 --> 13:13.566
... specializing in
long-term backup of data.

13:13.568 --> 13:15.301
Don't let your memories...

13:15.303 --> 13:18.070
Why, hello there, Dorian-0167.

13:18.072 --> 13:19.538
Good day, Dorian.

13:19.540 --> 13:21.540
Replace your worn-out objects with new...

13:21.542 --> 13:23.542
Hey, DRN-01...

13:23.544 --> 13:25.344
Kira, I need you to think.

13:25.346 --> 13:29.014
Were there any new people in his life?

13:29.016 --> 13:32.150
He doesn't know a lot of
people outside of work.

13:32.152 --> 13:34.019
Anything out of the ordinary?

13:34.021 --> 13:35.753
He'd been meeting with a headhunter.

13:35.755 --> 13:39.324
Was he looking to change jobs?

13:39.326 --> 13:41.026
No, when you have skills

13:41.028 --> 13:43.695
like... like Anton, you have options.

13:46.065 --> 13:48.066
Do you remember the name?

13:48.068 --> 13:50.201
He, uh...

13:50.203 --> 13:52.303
It was a woman.

13:52.305 --> 13:55.239
I think her name was Natalie.

13:55.241 --> 14:00.745
She worked for a recruitment
company called Kinsey.

14:08.720 --> 14:11.455
Your company makes
real-time tracking software

14:11.457 --> 14:13.157
for personalized advertising.

14:13.159 --> 14:14.658
Yeah.

14:22.067 --> 14:25.035
I think I know how Anton Cross was killed.

14:25.037 --> 14:26.537
Anton's software

14:26.539 --> 14:29.139
exploits an obscure bug in
the location-tracking protocols

14:29.141 --> 14:30.774
used by nearly all sensors.

14:30.776 --> 14:33.143
Phones, cameras,

14:33.145 --> 14:36.146
retinal scanners,
bio-stamps, even DNA readers,

14:36.148 --> 14:38.248
enabling them all to
communicate in real time

14:38.250 --> 14:41.217
to precisely track virtually
any person at any time.

14:41.219 --> 14:44.554
So Anton created the guidance
system for the bullet?

14:44.598 --> 14:47.232
Dorian, are you there?

14:47.234 --> 14:49.267
Hang on, it's Rudy.

14:49.269 --> 14:51.736
I have some information about
where the bullet came from.

14:51.738 --> 14:53.738
According to Interpol,

14:53.740 --> 14:55.239
the MEMS circuit in the slug was

14:55.241 --> 14:56.708
a Russian Army design.

14:56.710 --> 15:00.411
A batch was stolen from a
Ukrainian armory three months ago.

15:00.413 --> 15:01.479
And the theft was linked

15:01.481 --> 15:05.083
to a group called Revolution Now.

15:05.085 --> 15:07.018
A new weapon for the black market.

15:07.020 --> 15:10.688
Self-guided bullets that can
track down and kill anyone.

15:10.690 --> 15:13.090
Rudy thinks the MEMS in
the bullet that killed Anton

15:13.092 --> 15:14.558
were stolen by gunrunners.

15:14.560 --> 15:18.295
So, Anton sold his
software to arms dealers.

15:18.297 --> 15:21.432
And they killed him with it.

15:21.434 --> 15:23.567
What a world.

15:40.507 --> 15:43.509
The round was fired miles away.

15:47.347 --> 15:49.949
It's a lot of money.

15:49.951 --> 15:51.517
Don't you see what we have here?

15:51.519 --> 15:53.586
It's worth it.

15:54.822 --> 15:56.689
When can I get it?

15:56.691 --> 15:58.324
Soon.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.297
I want to see it work for myself.

16:08.435 --> 16:09.835
Follow me.

16:23.382 --> 16:24.783
We'll use her.

16:26.418 --> 16:28.453
Have to kill her anyway.

16:37.729 --> 16:39.449
So Anton sells his genius tracking software

16:39.451 --> 16:41.351
- to arms dealers.
- Who take it and use it

16:41.353 --> 16:43.118
to create a guidance system
for a new kind of bullet

16:43.120 --> 16:44.620
that can track down
anyone wherever they are.

16:44.622 --> 16:46.622
And once they get what
they needed from Anton,

16:46.624 --> 16:48.558
they kill him with it.

16:48.560 --> 16:50.492
So, how do we know they haven't
mass-produced them already?

16:50.494 --> 16:51.694
- We don't.
- Well, they just killed the man

16:51.696 --> 16:53.295
who designed the guidance system.

16:53.297 --> 16:55.297
They wouldn't have done that
unless R & D was already done.

16:55.299 --> 16:57.567
We need to find these
dealers and contain this.

16:57.569 --> 17:00.102
We've already notified FBI and DHS.

17:00.104 --> 17:02.237
I'll check Anton's financials.

17:02.239 --> 17:04.540
Maybe we can find out who
he sold the software to.

17:04.541 --> 17:06.308
But I'm not optimistic... he was in tech.

17:06.310 --> 17:08.310
He'd know how to hide money.

17:08.311 --> 17:09.611
I'd be happy to help, Detective Stahl.

17:09.613 --> 17:11.079
Don't stress yourself, bot.

17:11.082 --> 17:12.247
There's an easier way.

17:12.249 --> 17:13.815
Your daddy's really good
at hiding money, right?

17:13.817 --> 17:15.717
Why don't we just ask him how it's done.

17:15.719 --> 17:17.117
Stand up when you say that.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.054
Oh, wait, you are.

17:19.056 --> 17:20.320
Yeah, well, my parents
didn't have the money

17:20.323 --> 17:21.521
to make me taller.

17:21.523 --> 17:22.590
Or pretty.

17:22.593 --> 17:24.593
Even if you were genetically
enhanced, Richard,

17:24.595 --> 17:27.161
you would only be a taller jerk.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.600
Anton's girlfriend said he'd
been meeting a headhunter

17:31.602 --> 17:33.501
from a company called Kinsey.

17:33.503 --> 17:35.636
It was the only new thing in his life.

17:35.638 --> 17:37.538
All we have is her first name... Natalie.

17:37.540 --> 17:39.574
Can you check it out?

17:41.310 --> 17:43.611
There are no Natalies
currently employed by Kinsey.

17:43.613 --> 17:45.279
Maybe Kira got the name wrong.

17:45.281 --> 17:46.614
Or maybe she's lying.

17:49.150 --> 17:51.551
Let's go ask her.

17:55.590 --> 17:57.290
Hang on.

18:01.310 --> 18:03.430
We know you were after
something in the evidence vault

18:03.432 --> 18:06.233
when you assaulted the
precinct with Insyndicate.

18:06.235 --> 18:08.568
Are we really gonna go through this again?

18:08.570 --> 18:09.569
What was it?

18:09.627 --> 18:11.394
Asked but not answered.

18:11.396 --> 18:13.796
The same as the last 50 times.

18:13.798 --> 18:15.498
This time, it's different, Reinhardt.

18:15.500 --> 18:17.400
This time,

18:17.402 --> 18:19.468
I'm prepared to offer you a deal.

18:38.599 --> 18:41.167
You tell us what is here,

18:41.169 --> 18:42.769
and we make a deal.

18:42.771 --> 18:45.438
You're asking for a big
piece of information.

18:45.440 --> 18:48.308
For that, I get a full walk.

18:48.310 --> 18:50.343
That's not gonna happen.

18:52.112 --> 18:54.581
It's worth it.

18:56.116 --> 18:57.283
So close,

18:57.285 --> 18:59.285
and yet so far away.

18:59.287 --> 19:01.220
That must be frustrating.

19:01.222 --> 19:02.889
Isn't that right, buddy?

19:06.559 --> 19:08.394
Your girlfriend Anna

19:08.396 --> 19:10.696
would be very impressed
to see you walk me around.

19:10.698 --> 19:12.665
You do know that's not her real name?

19:15.402 --> 19:17.836
Wouldn't you just love

19:17.838 --> 19:20.539
to get your hands around
that chick's throat?

19:24.177 --> 19:25.877
I know where she is.

19:25.879 --> 19:28.546
Would you like to know?

19:28.548 --> 19:30.715
How bad?

19:34.486 --> 19:37.689
Get her to let me walk.

19:37.691 --> 19:40.192
We're gonna find her.

19:40.194 --> 19:42.760
And we're gonna find what
you were after anyway.

19:42.762 --> 19:45.563
Yeah, eventually, I guess.

19:45.565 --> 19:47.465
If you get enough time.

19:47.467 --> 19:51.168
But, um, do you really think

19:51.170 --> 19:53.304
that I'm the only one coming for it?

19:58.844 --> 20:00.712
Get him out of here.

20:00.714 --> 20:02.346
Thanks.

20:02.348 --> 20:04.181
All right, let's go.

20:07.886 --> 20:09.786
Were you really gonna offer him a deal?

20:09.788 --> 20:12.923
One I could live with, yeah.

20:12.925 --> 20:14.524
A deal you could live with.

20:14.526 --> 20:16.493
But what about the families

20:16.495 --> 20:18.328
of the 11 men killed in the ambush?

20:18.330 --> 20:20.897
And the men who died in the assault?

20:20.899 --> 20:22.198
Could they live with it?

20:22.200 --> 20:23.333
I've been working this nonstop

20:23.335 --> 20:24.901
to try to figure it out for them.

20:24.903 --> 20:27.371
So you negotiate with a murderer?

20:27.373 --> 20:28.772
What are you afraid is in here?

20:30.274 --> 20:32.242
Something even worse.

20:44.421 --> 20:45.755
Here you go.

20:51.227 --> 20:52.728
Kira.

20:52.730 --> 20:54.329
We need to talk.

20:54.331 --> 20:57.199
We suspect Anton was
selling your company's tech

20:57.201 --> 20:59.167
to people who killed him with it.

21:00.370 --> 21:02.571
The headhunter you mentioned... Natalie?

21:02.573 --> 21:04.573
We checked at Kinsey, she doesn't exist.

21:04.575 --> 21:06.609
You sure you got her name right?

21:06.611 --> 21:08.176
No, I'm not absolutely sure.

21:08.178 --> 21:09.178
How did you get her name?

21:09.179 --> 21:13.348
I bumped into them on the
street near our office.

21:13.350 --> 21:14.449
A couple weeks ago.

21:14.451 --> 21:15.784
They were coming back from lunch.

21:15.786 --> 21:16.785
She had blonde hair,

21:16.787 --> 21:18.320
Slavic accent.

21:18.322 --> 21:19.454
Anton introduced her.

21:57.692 --> 21:59.860
Could you identify her if you saw her?

21:59.862 --> 22:01.294
I think so, yes.

22:41.891 --> 22:42.958
John...

22:42.960 --> 22:44.426
What?

22:55.404 --> 22:58.239
I thought you said it never missed.

23:01.678 --> 23:03.612
You okay?

23:29.200 --> 23:31.834
Please remain still.

23:34.738 --> 23:37.773
Thank you for your cooperation.

23:37.775 --> 23:40.242
And remember:
hugs, not drugs.

23:40.244 --> 23:44.246
Stay on this side of the
wall and respect authority.

23:44.248 --> 23:46.649
How are your functions?

23:46.651 --> 23:48.551
You okay to continue?

23:52.622 --> 23:54.156
Fantastic.

23:59.196 --> 24:00.862
Hey-hey, it's okay, it's okay.

24:00.864 --> 24:02.231
You're safe in here, Kira.

24:02.233 --> 24:03.932
This truck is made of titanium.

24:03.934 --> 24:05.700
They can't track you in here.

24:10.973 --> 24:13.708
I'd be dead if it weren't for you.

24:15.277 --> 24:16.745
Thank you.

24:18.248 --> 24:22.551
Kira, you must know something about Anton.

24:22.553 --> 24:23.885
That's why they tried to kill you.

24:23.887 --> 24:25.186
I don't.

24:25.188 --> 24:26.954
If you're holding anything back,

24:26.956 --> 24:28.222
now is the time to tell us.

24:28.224 --> 24:29.790
I don't. I don't know anything.

24:29.792 --> 24:33.994
I don't know why they
would want me dead, too.

24:33.996 --> 24:35.930
Okay.

24:37.032 --> 24:38.966
We're gonna transfer you to a safe house,

24:38.968 --> 24:40.568
a place where you can't be tracked.

24:41.970 --> 24:44.137
I'm not going anywhere without my daughter.

24:45.907 --> 24:47.174
My best friend Janet has her.

24:47.176 --> 24:50.911
I need to go see her right now.

24:50.913 --> 24:53.213
She'll worry if I don't go home.

24:53.215 --> 24:56.149
Okay. We'll bring her
to you. What's her name?

24:56.151 --> 24:58.952
Aimee.

25:05.026 --> 25:08.027
I can't find her. She's not coming up.

25:29.783 --> 25:32.818
- Aimee!
- Mommy!

25:32.820 --> 25:34.753
I love you so much!

25:36.956 --> 25:39.024
Oh, bless you.

25:45.832 --> 25:47.899
We've got men outside.

25:47.901 --> 25:49.167
You'll be safe here.

25:49.169 --> 25:50.936
For now, maybe,

25:50.938 --> 25:53.038
but they will find me. You have no idea.

25:53.040 --> 25:54.973
That's what this technology
is designed to do.

25:54.975 --> 25:57.242
I've seen what this technology can do.

25:57.244 --> 26:01.246
Kira, I need you to be
honest with yourself.

26:01.248 --> 26:05.183
Is there any part of you that doubts Anton?

26:05.185 --> 26:08.286
Well...

26:12.258 --> 26:14.659
- Yes.
- Why?

26:14.661 --> 26:19.130
Because of how secretive he
was about where he was going

26:19.132 --> 26:20.597
and who he was with.

26:20.599 --> 26:22.199
Why didn't you tell me this before?

26:22.201 --> 26:24.201
Because I didn't want to believe it.

26:24.203 --> 26:26.704
Whatever he was involved with,

26:26.706 --> 26:28.673
look what he's done to us.

26:29.941 --> 26:31.842
He was like a father to her.

26:31.844 --> 26:34.078
How could he do this to us?

26:47.492 --> 26:49.092
What if I got scrubbed?

26:49.094 --> 26:51.761
- I could go to a scrubber...
- Kira...

26:51.763 --> 26:53.096
and erase everything I know about Anton.

26:53.098 --> 26:54.664
Whatever they think that he told me,

26:54.666 --> 26:57.200
I could have him extracted.

26:57.202 --> 26:59.535
That might make sense to you now, but...

26:59.537 --> 27:02.638
I need to be here for her.
She's all that I've got.

27:02.640 --> 27:05.575
And then maybe they'll leave me alone...

27:05.577 --> 27:08.011
when I'm no longer a threat to them.

27:08.013 --> 27:10.646
It doesn't work like
that. It wouldn't matter.

27:10.648 --> 27:14.183
Look, forgetting Anton
is not the answer here.

27:14.185 --> 27:17.653
Are you one of those
anti-scrubbers or something?

27:17.655 --> 27:19.988
I don't agree with scrubbing.

27:19.990 --> 27:23.158
Well, maybe if your life
depended on it, you would.

27:23.160 --> 27:25.695
You have more faith in the tech finding you

27:25.697 --> 27:27.896
than me stopping it. I understand that.

27:27.898 --> 27:29.698
But I need you to trust me.

27:31.134 --> 27:34.069
Can you guarantee that you can protect us?

27:38.942 --> 27:40.976
No.

27:40.978 --> 27:44.879
Look, I know you're
worried about your daughter,

27:44.881 --> 27:46.881
but if this technology gets out,

27:46.883 --> 27:49.484
it'll change the world we live in.

27:49.486 --> 27:52.854
It'll change the world
that she lives in forever.

27:58.093 --> 28:00.061
You know something.

28:00.063 --> 28:02.730
We just gotta figure out what it is.

28:02.732 --> 28:06.167
But I can promise you that my partner and I

28:06.169 --> 28:09.536
will do everything we can to protect you.

28:16.077 --> 28:18.612
What do you need me to do?

28:29.189 --> 28:30.823
What's wrong with him?

28:32.526 --> 28:34.661
Sure, you got it.

28:35.963 --> 28:37.997
Captain approves. We're on.

28:37.999 --> 28:39.932
Please make him stop.

28:39.934 --> 28:41.767
It's a Korean pop song.

28:41.769 --> 28:43.635
I find it catchy and soothing.

28:45.038 --> 28:46.672
Rudy, if you don't do

28:46.674 --> 28:48.354
something about this, I'll shoot him, too.

28:55.014 --> 28:57.048
Thank you.

28:57.050 --> 28:59.484
So, you're using the young woman as bait?

28:59.486 --> 29:01.653
Yeah. Kira's comm signals are down.

29:01.655 --> 29:03.188
She's off the grid. We're gonna move her

29:03.190 --> 29:04.656
from the safe house,

29:04.658 --> 29:05.791
put her somewhere underground,

29:05.793 --> 29:07.091
turn the comms back on.

29:07.093 --> 29:08.493
Put her back on the grid?

29:08.495 --> 29:10.529
Draw the arms dealers to us.

29:10.531 --> 29:11.963
Um, perhaps,

29:11.965 --> 29:14.498
do you need any undercover help?

29:14.500 --> 29:16.067
Does this in any way,

29:16.069 --> 29:18.236
even tangentially, involve sexbots?

29:18.238 --> 29:19.637
Because I am quite willing...

29:19.639 --> 29:20.905
Yeah, you know what, Rudy?

29:20.907 --> 29:22.173
We're, um... we're good.

29:22.175 --> 29:24.175
Thanks.

29:26.813 --> 29:27.845
Kennex.

29:27.847 --> 29:29.079
Hey, it's me.

29:29.081 --> 29:30.180
Hey, how are you?

29:30.182 --> 29:31.782
I got something for you.

29:31.784 --> 29:33.651
Really? For me? Uh, that's sweet.

29:33.653 --> 29:34.952
You, uh... you shouldn't have.

29:34.954 --> 29:36.119
I meant on the case.

29:36.121 --> 29:37.755
I have something for you on Anton.

29:38.824 --> 29:39.990
Yeah, of course.

29:39.992 --> 29:41.258
Yeah, I, uh... I knew that.

29:42.528 --> 29:43.927
What do you got?

29:43.929 --> 29:45.762
Anton Cross's car has parking violations

29:45.764 --> 29:46.930
outside Merit Bank.

29:46.932 --> 29:48.298
Once, three weeks ago,

29:48.300 --> 29:50.234
and then again a week after that.

29:50.236 --> 29:51.835
We checked surveillance,

29:51.837 --> 29:54.171
and he did go inside the bank.

29:54.173 --> 29:56.673
Now, there was no account under his name,

29:56.675 --> 29:59.743
but there was one under a "Mark Cross."

29:59.745 --> 30:01.143
Mark is Anton's middle name.

30:01.145 --> 30:03.145
That's it. That's the money trail.

30:03.147 --> 30:05.281
Did you find the money he
got for selling the software?

30:05.283 --> 30:06.983
No, there was no money in the account,

30:06.985 --> 30:09.085
but there was a safe-deposit box.

30:09.087 --> 30:10.687
Maybe the money's in there.

30:10.689 --> 30:12.221
I'm gonna send you the address now.

30:12.223 --> 30:14.323
Okay, great. Thanks, Val. We'll check it.

30:17.827 --> 30:19.728
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

30:24.935 --> 30:27.569
No bitcoins.

30:27.571 --> 30:29.605
Wasn't hiding any money.

30:29.607 --> 30:30.973
A lot of personal effects.

30:34.277 --> 30:36.344
What do you make of this?

30:36.346 --> 30:37.746
There's numbers on 'em.

30:37.748 --> 30:38.947
Some sort of code.

30:39.982 --> 30:41.850
A password maybe.

30:44.754 --> 30:46.688
Video chip.

30:47.690 --> 30:48.791
It's full.

30:48.793 --> 30:51.293
Play it.

30:53.118 --> 30:55.286
We can get to her at any time.

30:55.288 --> 30:56.988
I think you know that.

30:56.990 --> 30:59.156
Don't make a mistake that can't be undone.

31:12.711 --> 31:16.313
Kira... do you think this will work?

31:16.315 --> 31:18.848
Can they protect you?

31:28.599 --> 31:30.160
Deliver the third part

31:30.162 --> 31:32.161
of the design schematic by Thursday.

31:32.163 --> 31:33.362
There will be no more time.

31:33.364 --> 31:35.398
Anton wasn't facilitating an arms deal.

31:36.834 --> 31:38.568
He was being extorted.

31:51.115 --> 31:53.682
Where is Kira Larsen?

32:12.869 --> 32:15.137
- John?
- What?

32:15.139 --> 32:17.172
I just received notification
that Kira Larsen has left

32:17.174 --> 32:19.008
the secure building five minutes ago.

32:20.143 --> 32:22.043
She's gone.

32:23.146 --> 32:24.746
Look, these guys

32:24.748 --> 32:26.914
aren't gonna stop until they find Kira.

32:26.916 --> 32:28.283
Until we find her, the only lie

32:28.285 --> 32:30.185
we have left to chase is Natalie.

32:30.187 --> 32:31.986
Anton lied about her for a reason.

32:31.988 --> 32:35.290
Kira said she saw them
outside and near their office

32:35.292 --> 32:37.725
two weeks ago coming back from lunch. Yeah?

32:37.727 --> 32:39.694
Well, we know what
Anton and Kira look like.

32:39.696 --> 32:41.729
So why not use facial
recog to search for them

32:41.731 --> 32:43.064
and another woman in the vicinity

32:43.066 --> 32:44.766
of their office a couple weeks ago?

32:44.768 --> 32:46.868
There's a lot of faces in the city.

32:46.870 --> 32:48.231
There's something you need to see.

32:53.275 --> 32:55.709
DHS was able to pull this off a black site

32:55.711 --> 32:59.246
which they were able to
trace back as far as Estonia.

32:59.248 --> 33:02.015
The language is Chechen.

33:02.017 --> 33:04.318
"With a maximum range of two kilometers,

33:04.320 --> 33:06.987
the Magic Bullet can
locate a single human target

33:06.989 --> 33:08.822
with an accuracy of 25 centimeters."

33:08.824 --> 33:10.323
"Fast, precise,

33:10.325 --> 33:12.859
and with little or no
risk to operator exposure,

33:12.861 --> 33:14.895
the Magic Bullet is also a bargain

33:14.897 --> 33:17.164
at the designated price per round."

33:19.333 --> 33:21.735
Tie up a loose end and make
an infomercial out of it.

33:21.737 --> 33:22.736
That's pretty cool.

33:22.738 --> 33:24.604
Cost-effective.

33:24.606 --> 33:26.372
Captain, we just intercepted a signal

33:26.374 --> 33:28.040
from Kira Larsen's personal comm.

33:28.042 --> 33:29.909
Bring it up.

33:32.879 --> 33:35.615
Looks like Kira went with your plan.

33:43.090 --> 33:45.124
Okay, now what?

33:45.126 --> 33:47.827
Now we wait.

33:47.829 --> 33:49.095
All right.

33:55.668 --> 33:57.970
Got her. But she's underground.

33:57.972 --> 33:59.705
The bullet can't reach her.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.674
We'll have to go get her.

34:13.987 --> 34:15.820
She still hasn't moved.

34:15.822 --> 34:18.056
3435 Randall Avenue.

34:18.058 --> 34:20.158
What's listed at 3435 Randall?

34:20.159 --> 34:21.692
It's listed as a plumbing supply,

34:21.694 --> 34:23.061
closed for the last 11 months.

34:23.063 --> 34:26.797
Yeah, there's at least half a
dozen memory shops on that block.

34:26.800 --> 34:28.166
Bet she's gone to a scrubber.

34:29.869 --> 34:32.270
Two lefts, then a right.

34:44.283 --> 34:45.616
Hey, what are you doing?

34:56.793 --> 34:57.927
Beat it.

34:59.930 --> 35:01.197
We got to go.

35:01.199 --> 35:02.865
- We don't have much time.
- I want them to find me.

35:02.867 --> 35:04.633
I want them to find me! And when they

35:04.635 --> 35:06.635
get here, they can watch me
having my memory scrubbed!

35:06.637 --> 35:08.271
I don't know why they're trying to kill me,

35:08.273 --> 35:10.206
but I know it's gotta have
something to do with Anton!

35:10.208 --> 35:13.175
I told you, if I get rid
of everything in my head

35:13.177 --> 35:14.777
about him, they'll leave me alone.

35:14.779 --> 35:16.345
It wouldn't matter.

35:16.347 --> 35:17.979
Look, we think we know

35:17.981 --> 35:19.581
why they tried to kill you.

35:19.583 --> 35:21.249
That woman you saw Anton with, Natalie,

35:21.251 --> 35:25.053
we believe she's an arms
dealer, and you can identify her.

35:25.055 --> 35:27.122
John.

35:28.157 --> 35:29.224
We need to hurry.

35:29.226 --> 35:31.293
Let's go, Kira.

35:39.035 --> 35:40.035
Get down!

35:48.456 --> 35:49.777
Backup units will be here

35:49.779 --> 35:50.945
- in under three minutes.
- Great.

35:50.947 --> 35:52.907
That should give them just
enough time to kill us.

36:02.166 --> 36:04.099
Can you draw their fire?!

36:09.105 --> 36:10.338
Go.

36:24.120 --> 36:26.388
Mine's still alive.

36:28.291 --> 36:29.491
- Mine's done.
- Police.

36:29.493 --> 36:31.226
Get your hands up. Hands up! Police!

36:31.228 --> 36:32.927
- Let me see your hands!
- All clear.

36:32.929 --> 36:34.563
- Roger, Detective.
- Clear!

36:34.565 --> 36:36.531
We got a code four!

36:36.533 --> 36:37.632
Kira.

36:39.467 --> 36:41.002
Get her out of here.

36:41.004 --> 36:42.436
Come on. Let's go.

36:42.438 --> 36:44.405
You're all right. Come with us.

36:49.477 --> 36:52.479
You've certainly taken
your fair share today.

36:52.481 --> 36:54.248
I'll send you the bill.

37:09.574 --> 37:12.042
We can get to her at any time.

37:12.044 --> 37:13.910
I think you know that.

37:13.912 --> 37:16.379
Don't make a mistake that can't be undone.

37:18.482 --> 37:20.017
Deliver the third part

37:20.019 --> 37:22.653
of the design schematic by Thursday.

37:22.655 --> 37:24.387
There will be no more time.

37:27.324 --> 37:29.192
Where did you get this?

37:29.194 --> 37:31.027
They're threats.

37:31.029 --> 37:34.364
We found the videos in a
safety-deposit box Anton had.

37:34.366 --> 37:36.832
Wh... what?

37:36.834 --> 37:39.235
Anton traded his software to protect you.

37:39.237 --> 37:41.971
They needed his expertise,

37:41.973 --> 37:43.506
and they used you to get it.

37:45.008 --> 37:49.378
Anton traded his software to save your life

37:49.380 --> 37:52.948
and the life of your daughter.

37:54.851 --> 37:57.519
We found these.

37:57.521 --> 38:00.122
Do you know what these numbers mean?

38:10.866 --> 38:13.535
He said he would save them, and he did.

38:14.870 --> 38:16.905
When we first met, he wrote down

38:16.907 --> 38:21.542
his phone number on a piece
of paper with a pen, and...

38:21.544 --> 38:24.612
he was old-fashioned that way.

38:24.614 --> 38:26.414
I ripped it up.

38:26.416 --> 38:30.151
And he said he would win me over...

38:30.153 --> 38:33.987
and that he would keep this as a memento.

38:35.824 --> 38:38.826
We used to write notes to each other...

38:40.429 --> 38:43.063
in pen.

38:47.437 --> 38:52.973
I can't tell you how happy I
am that I can remember that.

38:54.909 --> 38:56.243
I want you to have this.

38:59.214 --> 39:00.247
No, really, I...

39:00.249 --> 39:01.281
Please.

39:02.851 --> 39:06.253
I wouldn't have any of
him if it weren't for you.

39:08.989 --> 39:10.223
Thank you.

39:19.166 --> 39:21.534
Kira, I'll walk you out.

39:30.277 --> 39:33.379
Could you please put
that back into evidence?

39:33.381 --> 39:35.848
You know, I have something for you.

39:35.850 --> 39:37.416
- For me?
- Yeah.

39:37.418 --> 39:38.918
You're pulling my leg.

39:38.920 --> 39:41.387
No, I do this time. I mean it. I do.

39:43.424 --> 39:46.158
It's an energy chew.

39:46.160 --> 39:48.294
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

39:48.296 --> 39:49.395
For me?

39:49.397 --> 39:50.562
I thought you might need it.

39:50.564 --> 39:52.531
- You shouldn't have.
- I know.

39:52.533 --> 39:55.267
I got something for you.

39:55.269 --> 39:57.969
- For me?
- Yeah.

40:11.517 --> 40:13.184
Paper.

40:14.420 --> 40:16.921
Is that a pen?

40:16.923 --> 40:18.456
Wow.

40:25.431 --> 40:27.565
Sorry.

40:47.051 --> 40:49.152
Uh, thanks for the chew.

40:49.154 --> 40:51.020
Thank you.

40:52.290 --> 40:53.890
End of watch.

40:53.892 --> 40:57.494
All synthetics report to charging stations.

40:57.496 --> 41:00.230
IP Sec already has a
task force up and running.

41:00.232 --> 41:01.531
They're confident they'll be able

41:01.533 --> 41:03.266
to plug the location-tracking exploit.

41:03.268 --> 41:05.268
- Until the next one pops up.
- Yep.

41:06.971 --> 41:08.905
John.

41:08.907 --> 41:11.374
Thanks for not destroying any MX's today.

41:13.010 --> 41:14.643
Yeah, well...

41:14.645 --> 41:16.946
the night is young.
