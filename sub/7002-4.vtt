00:00.200 --> 00:02.300
Today we get to mess with

00:02.301 --> 00:04.903
A binford 60-pound
upright electric jackhammer.

00:04.904 --> 00:07.906
You know, al, they say
that breakin' up is hard to do.

00:07.907 --> 00:11.843
Ha-ha. Evidently neil sedaka
never played one of these
bad boys.

00:11.844 --> 00:13.845
This can make
some real noise -

00:13.846 --> 00:16.681
130 pulsating decibels
of jackhammer.

00:16.682 --> 00:19.250
Ar-ar-ar-ar-oh-oh-
ar-ar-ar.

00:19.251 --> 00:22.153
Oh-oh-oh.
You're right, tim.

00:22.154 --> 00:24.322
That's why we'll be
protecting our hearing

00:24.323 --> 00:27.826
With these soft foam-filled
plastic cushioned earmuffs.

00:27.827 --> 00:30.662
That's right, al,
and as any zz top fan knows,

00:30.663 --> 00:33.064
Hearing loss begins
at 85 decibels.

00:33.065 --> 00:35.867
At 100 decibels,
you have your ordinary
10-inch table saw.

00:35.868 --> 00:38.737
<i>(table saw whines)</i>

00:40.840 --> 00:43.908
At 120 decibels, you have
your 12-inch radial arm saw.

00:43.909 --> 00:46.711
<i>(radial arm saw whines)</i>

00:46.712 --> 00:50.148
And very dangerous
at 180 decibels,

00:50.149 --> 00:53.417
You have your unbelievable
68-inch mother-in-law.

00:53.418 --> 00:56.855
<i>(woman sings)</i>

00:56.856 --> 00:58.289
<i>(singing cut off)</i>

00:58.290 --> 01:00.058
Just kidding, nana.

01:00.059 --> 01:03.461
Al... Earmuffs on.

01:04.697 --> 01:06.464
All right, plug me in, al.

01:06.465 --> 01:09.500
I'll need to get ac power
to this thing quick,
all right?

01:11.704 --> 01:13.604
Plug it in, al.

01:13.605 --> 01:15.640
Al!

01:15.641 --> 01:17.142
Al!

01:22.048 --> 01:23.481
Fly's down.

01:25.517 --> 01:28.619
You're fired. <i>(laughs)</i>

01:33.693 --> 01:36.127
You know, ladies,
as al's best friend,

01:36.128 --> 01:39.130
I'd like to talk to you
about him for a minute
if I could.

01:39.131 --> 01:41.966
The beard - pretty
cheesy-looking, isn't it?

01:43.102 --> 01:46.004
And those flannel shirts
do nothing for me.

01:46.005 --> 01:48.606
As al's dating record
will attest, they don't
do much for him, either.

01:48.607 --> 01:51.776
<i>(jackhammer clacking)</i>

03:02.547 --> 03:05.850
Well, what do you think?
Can we put the kids
in the middle?

03:07.552 --> 03:09.187
Here's the last of 'em.

03:09.188 --> 03:12.390
It was really nice of your mom
to give us these encyclopedias.

03:12.391 --> 03:14.392
What are you doing
with the trunk?

03:14.393 --> 03:16.895
Putting books in it.
This thing's
gonna weigh a ton.

03:16.896 --> 03:19.164
I've got two boxes
in the garage for this.

03:19.165 --> 03:20.665
Well, that's silly.

03:20.666 --> 03:23.367
Just use this, and you don't
have to make two trips.

03:23.368 --> 03:25.369
Right. I'll be making
two trips anyway -

03:25.370 --> 03:27.638
One to the garage
and one to the hospital.

03:27.639 --> 03:29.473
Oh, honey, you can do this.

03:29.474 --> 03:32.343
You used to bench press
your body weight in college.

03:32.344 --> 03:36.247
You're heavier now.
Should be able to lift more.

03:36.248 --> 03:38.216
If that were true,
you should be able
to lift the whole...

03:38.217 --> 03:40.351
The whole what?

03:40.352 --> 03:43.788
The whole wheat bread
over there...

03:45.390 --> 03:47.358
I got the lead.

03:47.359 --> 03:50.195
Yeah.
Oh, my baby
got the lead!

03:50.196 --> 03:52.197
He's gonna play
peter pan.
Good going, buddy.

03:52.198 --> 03:55.033
I knew that he had that spark,
that thing that says,

03:55.034 --> 03:57.202
"I am an artist.
I live for the theater."

03:57.203 --> 03:59.037
Down, jill. Down.
I told you this.

03:59.038 --> 04:00.972
When he was in
that christmas pageant,

04:00.973 --> 04:02.974
All the other kids
stood up on the stage.

04:02.975 --> 04:06.677
Randy... <i>(deep voice)</i>
stood up on the stage.

04:06.678 --> 04:08.512
He probably gets it
from you, hon,

04:08.513 --> 04:10.348
'cause you don't
just burn meat loaf,

04:10.349 --> 04:12.183
You... <i>(deep voice)</i>
burn meat loaf.

04:12.184 --> 04:15.119
I'm just glad
I finally have a kid

04:15.120 --> 04:16.954
Who appreciates culture.

04:16.956 --> 04:18.789
Yeah, and the best part is

04:18.790 --> 04:22.160
I get to miss social studies
for a month.

04:22.161 --> 04:24.495
Honey, what is this?

04:24.496 --> 04:26.998
Nothing.
Oh, yeah?

04:26.999 --> 04:29.100
<i>"desire's passion</i>
<i>in the wind."</i>

04:29.101 --> 04:31.769
It's nothing. I bought it
in the grocery store line.

04:31.770 --> 04:33.504
And these?
No...

04:33.505 --> 04:35.539
<i>"desire's real passion."</i>

04:35.540 --> 04:37.942
<i>"the sweet kiss of desire."</i>

04:37.943 --> 04:42.480
<i>"desire and the leprechaun."</i>
<i>(laughs)</i>

04:42.481 --> 04:43.982
Cut it out.

04:43.983 --> 04:46.150
I didn't know
you liked books like this.

04:46.151 --> 04:49.854
I know it sounds silly,
but they're actually
very well written.

04:52.624 --> 04:54.259
Really?

04:54.260 --> 04:55.760
<i>(clears throat)</i>

04:55.761 --> 04:57.762
<i>(english accent)</i>
"her heart stood still

04:57.763 --> 05:00.064
"as derek swept her
into his arms.

05:00.065 --> 05:03.501
"his sinewy biceps rippled

05:03.502 --> 05:06.004
"as he carried her
up the stairs

05:06.005 --> 05:10.341
To a night
of eternal ecstasy."

05:10.342 --> 05:12.944
<i>(normal voice)</i>
oh, please.

05:12.945 --> 05:17.415
Ok, so I enjoy
cheap romance and drama.

05:17.416 --> 05:20.451
Fine. I'll bring
some hand puppets
to the bedroom.

05:20.452 --> 05:22.120
Come on, I'll help you

05:22.121 --> 05:24.389
Get this over
out to the garage.

05:24.390 --> 05:27.959
Whoa. This is a lot heavier
than I thought it was.

05:27.960 --> 05:32.230
<i>(deep voice)</i>
maybe derek should help,
with those sinewy biceps.

05:32.231 --> 05:35.066
He probably could.
He's only 21.

05:35.067 --> 05:37.168
Step aside, little lady.

05:37.169 --> 05:39.170
Come on, tim.
I was just teasing you.

05:39.171 --> 05:41.806
A minute ago, you were
asking me to carry it.
No, no, no.

05:41.807 --> 05:44.342
That was before I knew
how heavy it was.

05:44.343 --> 05:46.177
You don't think
I can carry this?

05:46.178 --> 05:49.013
Maybe, if there weren't
any books in it.

05:50.615 --> 05:52.883
I can lift it,
with the books.
Oh, come on, tim.

05:52.884 --> 05:54.885
You're gonna
hurt yourself.

05:54.886 --> 05:57.855
Oh, watch my biceps ripple
one by one.

05:57.856 --> 06:00.691
<i>(grunting)</i>

06:02.494 --> 06:04.795
Trunk of desire.

06:06.531 --> 06:10.068
It's all in the legs, babe.

06:10.069 --> 06:12.036
Ohh.

06:12.037 --> 06:14.672
Ohh. Ahh.

06:14.673 --> 06:16.975
Ohh. Gee.

06:16.976 --> 06:18.977
Ohh!

06:18.978 --> 06:20.845
<i>(groaning)</i>

06:30.389 --> 06:33.491
Do you have to go
to the bathroom, dad?

06:33.492 --> 06:36.027
I don't think that...

06:36.028 --> 06:39.130
I don't think I'm ever gonna
go to the bathroom again.

06:42.434 --> 06:43.767
What happened?

06:43.768 --> 06:46.337
I pulled my groin.

06:46.338 --> 06:47.705
What's that?

06:47.706 --> 06:49.773
My very favorite muscle.

06:51.310 --> 06:53.811
I'll get mom.
No, no, no,
don't tell your mother.

06:53.812 --> 06:55.813
Don't tell your mother.
Why not?

06:55.814 --> 06:58.216
Whenever I get hurt,
she makes me feel better.

06:58.217 --> 07:01.652
Well, that's regular pain.
This is man pain.

07:01.653 --> 07:04.722
How do you know if you have
regular pain or man pain?

07:04.723 --> 07:07.892
If you do something stupid,
it's probably man pain.

07:09.328 --> 07:12.596
But if you don't tell mom,
isn't that lying?

07:12.597 --> 07:14.598
Not if you don't
say the words.

07:14.599 --> 07:16.600
If you said the words,
it'd be lying.

07:16.601 --> 07:18.936
What if she asks me?
Lie.

07:20.805 --> 07:22.873
Lisa.

07:22.874 --> 07:25.043
Al, al, come here.
I need some help.

07:25.044 --> 07:29.813
I don't believe that's part
of my job description, tim.

07:29.814 --> 07:32.050
Just stand there
and block my view,

07:32.051 --> 07:34.818
And tell me
if anybody's coming, ok?

07:37.122 --> 07:39.190
Uh-huh.

07:39.191 --> 07:40.358
Butterfly's loose.

07:42.094 --> 07:44.728
You ever feel like
your whole groin is on fire?

07:44.729 --> 07:48.499
Every night, tim.

07:48.500 --> 07:51.202
15 seconds, guys.
Thanks, lisa.

07:51.203 --> 07:54.205
What happened is
I pulled a groin muscle
yesterday at home.

07:54.206 --> 07:56.207
I went to the doctor
this morning.

07:56.208 --> 07:58.509
He said I'm not supposed
to lift anything heavy,

07:58.510 --> 08:01.179
So we have to change
the format of the show
a little bit today.

08:01.180 --> 08:03.448
You are gonna have to do
all the work.

08:03.449 --> 08:05.883
And what would
the change be, tim?

08:05.884 --> 08:09.253
<i>(lisa)</i> does everybody know
what time it is?
<i>(audience)</i> tool time!

08:09.254 --> 08:10.455
That's right.

08:10.456 --> 08:12.457
Binford tools
is proud to present

08:12.458 --> 08:15.726
Tim "the tool man" taylor!

08:15.727 --> 08:17.628
<i>(cheers and applause)</i>

08:17.629 --> 08:19.663
Thank you.

08:19.664 --> 08:23.334
Aw, thank you very much.
Welcome to <i>tool time.</i>

08:23.335 --> 08:25.436
I'm your host
tim "the tool man" taylor,

08:25.437 --> 08:27.505
And of course we all know
my assistant al.

08:27.506 --> 08:29.507
Al, what are we
up to today?

08:29.508 --> 08:31.842
Well, tim, today
we're gonna be showing you

08:31.843 --> 08:35.011
How to patch up your sidewalk
or driveway, and to do that,

08:35.013 --> 08:38.482
We're gonna need to mix up
some... Concrete.

08:38.484 --> 08:40.217
That's right. Concrete.

08:40.219 --> 08:42.520
Cement, sand,
gravel and water.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.822
A man's play-doh. Ha-ha.

08:44.823 --> 08:47.658
The best place to get concrete,
of course, is a cement truck,

08:47.659 --> 08:49.994
But of course none of us
have a cement truck.

08:49.995 --> 08:52.530
But we'd all like one,
wouldn't we?

08:52.531 --> 08:55.699
Who wouldn't want 65,000 pounds
of hydraulic diesel power...?

08:55.700 --> 08:59.737
Oh, yeah. 10 yarder,
15-chute, spit wad
of gravel-churn...

08:59.738 --> 09:02.607
Ar-ar-ar-ahh-ooh.

09:06.978 --> 09:10.681
But quite frankly, who needs
65,000 pounds of cement?

09:10.682 --> 09:13.684
Nobody, not unless you have
your mother-in-law visit,

09:13.685 --> 09:16.887
And you want to make her
some loafers. Ha-ha-ha-ha.

09:16.888 --> 09:18.889
Just kidding, nana.

09:18.890 --> 09:20.558
Speaking of loafers...

09:20.559 --> 09:23.227
Al, why don't we
mix up that concrete?

09:23.228 --> 09:26.764
Well, since we'll only
be mixing up a small amount,

09:26.765 --> 09:30.501
All we'll need is
a wheelbarrow, water,
sand and cement.

09:30.502 --> 09:32.036
Sounds like that recipe

09:32.037 --> 09:34.438
For the cookies
you brought in yesterday.

09:34.439 --> 09:36.174
My mother made those, tim.

09:36.175 --> 09:40.010
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hope she's dating a dentist.

09:40.011 --> 09:41.145
Here you go, tim.

09:41.146 --> 09:42.680
Oh! Aah!

09:51.290 --> 09:54.292
We'll be right back
after these messages
from binford.

09:56.195 --> 09:57.895
Hey, shut up, brad!
Boys...

09:57.896 --> 10:00.831
Face it.
You're the king of dorks.

10:00.832 --> 10:03.901
<i>(tv playing)</i>

10:03.902 --> 10:06.370
Dad, look.

10:06.371 --> 10:08.772
Oh-ho.

10:08.773 --> 10:11.676
Yeah, this is my costume.
I look like an elf.

10:11.677 --> 10:14.011
No, elves have
those pointed shoes.

10:14.012 --> 10:16.146
Yeah, like these?

10:16.147 --> 10:19.317
Exactly like those.

10:19.318 --> 10:21.952
Yeah, they even match
his sissy green tights.

10:21.953 --> 10:23.787
Cut it out.
They're not sissy.

10:23.788 --> 10:25.590
All your superheroes
wear tights.

10:25.591 --> 10:27.925
Superman, batman,
spider-man...
Wonder woman.

10:27.926 --> 10:30.928
Hey, shut up.
You gotta wear tights
if you fly.

10:30.929 --> 10:34.098
It's an faa regulation.
It's aerodynamic or something.

10:34.099 --> 10:36.534
Yeah, but I'm not
gonna fly.

10:36.535 --> 10:38.536
What do you mean?
You gotta fly.

10:38.537 --> 10:41.105
You're the pan man, man.

10:41.106 --> 10:46.043
Yeah, well, mrs. Miller says
I'm supposed to, like, prance.

10:46.044 --> 10:48.078
Oh, boy, oh, boy.

10:48.079 --> 10:52.383
Oh, no, no. No, stop.
Don't do that. No!

10:55.721 --> 10:58.589
Men don't prance.

10:58.590 --> 11:02.192
We walk, we run, we skip
if no one's looking.

11:02.193 --> 11:04.194
We jump,
that sort of stuff.

11:04.195 --> 11:06.830
But we don't ever,
<i>ever</i> prance.

11:06.831 --> 11:09.166
Ohh. Ohh.

11:09.167 --> 11:12.336
Yeah, but I can't fly.
The school doesn't have
the equipment.

11:12.337 --> 11:13.504
They don't?

11:13.505 --> 11:16.173
No, and nobody knows
how to build it.

11:16.174 --> 11:18.976
Nobody knows how
to build it? Oh-ho-ho.

11:18.977 --> 11:20.478
Wait, dad. Dad, no.

11:20.479 --> 11:22.513
A pulley system...
Cut it out. No. Dad.

11:22.514 --> 11:25.516
Hey, hey, hey, you wanna fly,
I'm the guy can fly you.

11:25.517 --> 11:27.351
A double-ratchet
pulley system,

11:27.352 --> 11:29.019
Counterweight
or something...

11:29.020 --> 11:32.189
I can get you flying
90 miles an hour
around that school.

11:32.190 --> 11:34.191
Well, yeah,
I'd rather prance.

11:34.192 --> 11:37.495
No one ever died
in a prancing accident.

11:37.496 --> 11:39.830
You know,
as I see it, fella,

11:39.831 --> 11:41.499
You got two choices.

11:41.500 --> 11:44.368
One - you're soaring
30 feet in the air,

11:44.369 --> 11:47.305
Swooping, diving,
twisting, turning
over the audience.

11:47.306 --> 11:50.841
They're looking up, going,
"what's he flying for?
What's he gonna do to us?"

11:50.842 --> 11:52.843
Or... You can prance around

11:52.844 --> 11:56.146
In that dorky
little green outfit

11:56.147 --> 11:58.783
Wearing elf shoes.

12:01.753 --> 12:02.920
Fly me.

12:02.921 --> 12:04.755
Yes. Yes. Yea-ow.

12:04.756 --> 12:06.824
Ow. Ohh.

12:06.825 --> 12:10.528
I'm home.
Aha-honey. Honey.

12:10.529 --> 12:12.229
Hi.
Hi.

12:12.230 --> 12:14.231
Are the kids home?

12:14.232 --> 12:15.833
Randy just went upstairs.

12:15.834 --> 12:18.836
Oh. You wanna help me
with the groceries?

12:18.837 --> 12:23.040
Uh, jill,
I wanna tell you something.

12:23.041 --> 12:25.710
Yesterday,
when I lifted that trunk...

12:25.711 --> 12:28.579
Oh, well, that is so weird
that you mentioned that,

12:28.580 --> 12:31.415
'cause I have been
thinking about it all day.

12:31.416 --> 12:32.817
What?
Well, I...

12:32.818 --> 12:35.319
I know I told you
not to do it.
You were right.

12:35.320 --> 12:37.822
And I know I'm supposed
to be way past this.

12:37.823 --> 12:40.758
It's embarrassing,
but I gotta tell ya.
I know what you're gonna say.

12:40.759 --> 12:44.328
It really turned me on.
<i>(grunts)</i> huh?

12:44.329 --> 12:48.566
Hey, mom, is it ok
if I go to tommy's?

12:48.567 --> 12:50.868
Please.

13:00.445 --> 13:02.980
When you heaved that trunk

13:02.981 --> 13:05.949
Up onto those powerful arms,

13:05.950 --> 13:10.153
And I saw
all those muscles rippling,

13:10.154 --> 13:13.924
I thought, "whoa.
That is no boy.

13:13.925 --> 13:15.793
That's my man!"

13:15.794 --> 13:17.695
<i>(laughs)</i>

13:17.696 --> 13:19.830
Where are we going?
Going upstairs.

13:19.831 --> 13:20.798
Upstairs?

13:23.435 --> 13:29.840
Mm. Mm. Mm. <i>Mm.</i>

13:29.841 --> 13:31.842
Ok.
<i>(laughs)</i>

13:31.843 --> 13:33.343
Let's go upstairs.

13:33.344 --> 13:35.112
Tim?
What is it?

13:35.113 --> 13:36.847
<i>(sighs)</i>

13:38.249 --> 13:40.418
Carry me.
Huh?

13:41.920 --> 13:44.221
<i>(thud/tim groans)</i>

13:49.294 --> 13:50.360
<i>(groaning)</i>

13:50.361 --> 13:53.063
Oh, honey, I am so sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

13:53.064 --> 13:54.899
Honey, this isn't
your fault.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.901
It's not my fault.
I jumped into your arms.

13:58.737 --> 14:01.572
Ok, it was your fault.

14:01.573 --> 14:04.909
What do you want me to do?
Shall I get you some ice?
Ice would be good.

14:04.910 --> 14:07.678
I'm no doctor,
but I think I pulled
my groin muscle.

14:07.679 --> 14:10.514
Oh, no. Mark, have you
seen the ice pack?

14:10.515 --> 14:12.550
It's in the garage.
I'll get it.

14:12.551 --> 14:15.385
What is it doing
in the garage?

14:15.386 --> 14:19.122
Brad made a parachute
for mrs. Thompson's cat.

14:20.992 --> 14:22.760
<i>What?</i>

14:22.761 --> 14:25.596
It didn't work.

14:27.231 --> 14:29.366
Why do you need
an ice pack?

14:29.367 --> 14:31.401
Well, daddy hurt himself.

14:31.402 --> 14:34.805
You mean he told you
about his man pain?

14:34.806 --> 14:38.241
His "man pain"?
What man pain would that be?

14:38.242 --> 14:41.745
It's the pain I'm not
supposed to tell you about.

14:41.746 --> 14:44.815
Oh, I already know about that.

14:44.816 --> 14:48.352
You know he hurt
his favorite muscle?

14:49.988 --> 14:51.956
Sure.

14:51.957 --> 14:53.958
I just don't know
how he did it.

14:53.959 --> 14:55.626
How did he do that?

14:55.627 --> 14:56.861
Carrying the trunk.

14:56.862 --> 15:00.664
Oh, right.
Carrying the trunk.

15:00.665 --> 15:02.332
Is daddy going to be ok?

15:02.333 --> 15:04.668
Oh, yeah.
Daddy's gonna be fine.

15:04.669 --> 15:07.137
Mommy's gonna take
good care of daddy.

15:09.708 --> 15:13.677
Oh, honey, I just...
I feel so bad.

15:13.678 --> 15:16.279
You know,
I never realized

15:16.280 --> 15:19.182
That I weigh so much more
than that trunk.

15:19.183 --> 15:22.319
Honey, that trunk
didn't give birth
to three kids.

15:26.525 --> 15:29.026
That's right.

15:29.027 --> 15:31.529
I think you maybe hurt me
worse than I thought.

15:31.530 --> 15:34.431
Probably be a good idea if
I sat on the couch all week
and watched football.

15:34.432 --> 15:36.066
I'd feel better, I think.

15:36.067 --> 15:39.570
Well, that's a good idea.
Oh, and you know what else?

15:39.571 --> 15:41.572
I could get you
a little bell,

15:41.573 --> 15:43.908
And you could ring it
whenever you need me.

15:43.909 --> 15:46.410
That's silly.
If I need you,
I'll just yell.

15:46.411 --> 15:49.780
Oh, good idea.
Here's your ice.

15:49.781 --> 15:52.716
Aah! Aah!

15:54.553 --> 15:56.386
Well, pookums,

15:56.387 --> 15:59.189
Did I hurt your man pain?

15:59.190 --> 16:01.592
Mark, you squealer!

16:01.593 --> 16:02.993
She tricked me!

16:07.632 --> 16:09.232
Hi-de-ho, neighbor.

16:09.233 --> 16:10.634
Hey, wilson.

16:10.635 --> 16:13.070
And what are you doing
over there?

16:13.071 --> 16:16.774
Oh, I'm designing
a pulley system

16:16.775 --> 16:19.276
To fly randy
for his school play.

16:19.277 --> 16:21.011
He's playing peter pan.

16:21.012 --> 16:23.480
I notice you're hobbling,
there, tim.
Yeah.

16:23.481 --> 16:26.316
I pulled my groin muscle
trying to lift this trunk
for jill.

16:26.317 --> 16:28.886
Ouchihuahua.

16:28.887 --> 16:31.889
Well, if you needed help,
why didn't you call me?

16:31.890 --> 16:34.458
I wanted to show her
that I could do it myself.

16:34.459 --> 16:36.526
Oh, I see.

16:36.527 --> 16:40.163
After all this time,
you still want to
impress your bride.

16:40.164 --> 16:41.865
Yeah, that's kinda it.

16:41.866 --> 16:44.969
You know, jill and I have been
married for 13 years...
14.

16:44.970 --> 16:47.638
14 years, you know, and...

16:47.639 --> 16:50.674
I still try to show off
for her now and then.

16:50.675 --> 16:54.678
I think what you did
had a certain... Nobility.

16:54.679 --> 16:57.615
You see, tim,
you were being a peacock.

16:57.616 --> 17:01.685
Yeah. Oh. <i>(grunts)</i>

17:01.686 --> 17:04.121
That's good, huh?
Oh, yes.

17:04.122 --> 17:08.157
You were trying
to impress your peahen
by displaying your plumage.

17:08.159 --> 17:11.127
God, and I pulled the heck
out of my plumage.

17:12.763 --> 17:14.297
Mm-hmm-hmm-hmm.

17:14.298 --> 17:16.299
What's really
bothering you, tim?

17:16.300 --> 17:19.869
It's nothing.
Well, wilson, I'm confused.

17:19.871 --> 17:21.872
I'm carrying
this trunk of books,

17:21.873 --> 17:23.874
And I find out
she likes these books

17:23.875 --> 17:25.876
About all these guys
with rippling muscles,

17:25.877 --> 17:28.512
So I wanted to show her
my rippling muscles.

17:28.512 --> 17:31.515
These guys end up
carrying women off
upstairs to ecstasy,

17:31.516 --> 17:34.184
And I pull a groin muscle.

17:34.185 --> 17:37.287
Well, tim, I think
you've got something
over these young guys.

17:37.288 --> 17:39.089
You do?
Uh-huh.

17:39.090 --> 17:42.092
Yes, it's best summed up
in an ancient chinese proverb.

17:42.093 --> 17:45.328
It goes...
<i>(speaking chinese)</i>

17:54.005 --> 17:57.107
Wait, is that
peking dialect?

17:57.108 --> 17:58.776
I am so sorry, tim.

17:58.777 --> 18:00.978
It may lose a bit
in the translation,

18:00.979 --> 18:03.313
But it goes,

18:03.314 --> 18:05.816
"a great lover
is not one who romances

18:05.817 --> 18:07.885
A different woman
every night."

18:07.886 --> 18:09.219
<i>(grunts)</i>

18:09.220 --> 18:11.221
"a great lover is one

18:11.222 --> 18:14.958
Who romances the same woman
for a lifetime."

18:14.959 --> 18:18.361
That's something
to think about, isn't it?

18:18.362 --> 18:20.898
Is there anything
you <i>don't</i> know, wilson?

18:22.533 --> 18:24.601
I don't know.

18:27.005 --> 18:30.507
Pay attention, boys.
I'll show you how it's done.

18:30.508 --> 18:31.975
Dad, when is
the ice cream truck coming?

18:31.976 --> 18:33.210
How am I supposed to know?

18:33.211 --> 18:35.079
See? I told you,
stupid. Look.

18:35.080 --> 18:37.547
Peter pan is always
played by a woman.

18:37.548 --> 18:40.617
No way.
Look at the pictures.

18:40.618 --> 18:43.353
"mary martin,
sandy duncan."

18:43.354 --> 18:45.122
Oh, no.

18:45.123 --> 18:48.525
Dad, why isn't
the ice cream truck here?
I don't know.

18:48.526 --> 18:51.061
Dad, why didn't you tell me
it's a girl's part?

18:51.062 --> 18:52.529
I can't do this.

18:52.530 --> 18:55.132
No, no. We're taylors.
We're not quitters.

18:55.133 --> 18:58.535
And besides, just because
a woman does it doesn't mean
a man can't do it.

18:58.536 --> 19:00.337
It's time
to reclaim peter pan.

19:00.338 --> 19:02.339
Make him your kind of guy,

19:02.340 --> 19:05.008
A guy that whittles,
ice skates and goes
on his skateboard.

19:05.009 --> 19:07.244
A man's man, a guy
with hairy chest. Ar-ar-ar.

19:07.245 --> 19:09.813
Dad, is the ice cream truck
coming <i>soon?</i>

19:09.814 --> 19:14.618
Would you forget
about the ice cream truck
for a minute?! Ow. Ohh.

19:14.619 --> 19:16.120
Brad, let's start flying.

19:16.121 --> 19:19.123
Pull the rope.
Dad, there's no way
we can fly you.

19:19.124 --> 19:21.925
Yes, there is a way
you can fly me.
You know why?

19:21.926 --> 19:24.728
Because I've got
all these pulleys
counterweighted, ok?

19:24.729 --> 19:27.097
This isn't just piano wire.
This is aircraft cable.

19:27.098 --> 19:29.099
We could lift nana
with this stuff.

19:29.100 --> 19:31.401
Wow.
You're darn right, "wow."

19:31.402 --> 19:35.205
All right, fly me like an eagle.
Pull it up like I showed you.

19:35.206 --> 19:37.707
No wonder men
don't play this part.

19:37.708 --> 19:39.977
Guys, hold it.
I don't have it
rigged right.

19:39.978 --> 19:41.478
Whoa. No. Ohh.

19:41.479 --> 19:44.447
Stop, please.
Come on, dad.
Think happy thoughts.

19:44.448 --> 19:47.384
You're married.
You're out of the house.

19:47.385 --> 19:49.552
Now, go on.
Get back, get back.

19:49.553 --> 19:51.621
All right, now fly me.
Go, go.

20:01.666 --> 20:04.001
It's that simple.

20:04.002 --> 20:06.203
<i>(jill)</i> tim,
what are you doing?!

20:06.204 --> 20:08.071
He's flying, mom!

20:08.072 --> 20:09.572
You crazy?

20:09.573 --> 20:12.475
Come on, guys.
Fly me up so I can
see my peahen.

20:12.476 --> 20:16.213
Mom, dad called you
a pea brain!
That's not what I said.

20:16.214 --> 20:18.415
Come on, guys.
All together,
pull me up there.

20:18.416 --> 20:20.417
Mark, randy,
grab the rope.

20:20.418 --> 20:23.053
<i>(all shout)</i>

20:23.054 --> 20:24.955
<i>(laughing)</i>

20:24.956 --> 20:27.825
What are you doing?
Just hear me out, hon.

20:27.826 --> 20:30.127
Well, stop it.
Get down from there.

20:30.128 --> 20:32.162
I just wanna explain
the groin thing.

20:32.163 --> 20:34.664
You don't
have to explain.

20:34.665 --> 20:37.567
I'm sorry I put the ice
down your pants.

20:37.568 --> 20:40.403
Don't be sorry about that.
It melted. It felt great.

20:40.404 --> 20:42.405
Just get down.
You can come inside.

20:42.406 --> 20:45.475
I was trying to impress you,
and you know what I thought?

20:45.476 --> 20:48.812
I don't need a different
chinese woman every night.
What?

20:48.813 --> 20:50.747
I just need you
for the rest of my life.

20:55.186 --> 20:58.488
See, after 13 years
of marriage...
14.

20:58.489 --> 21:01.524
14 years, I want you still
to be impressed with me.

21:01.525 --> 21:03.393
I am impressed with you.

21:03.394 --> 21:05.195
Come inside
before you hurt yourself.

21:05.196 --> 21:08.698
I know what I'm doing.
I'm flying, honey!

21:12.203 --> 21:15.005
That's backwards.
That's not easy.

21:15.006 --> 21:18.575
I'm a peacock.
I'm spreading my wings for you.

21:18.576 --> 21:22.346
Tim, peacocks can't fly.

21:22.347 --> 21:24.348
<i>(♪ ice cream truck music)</i>
<i>(mark)</i> ice cream
truck's here!

21:24.349 --> 21:26.350
<i>(randy)</i> ice cream!
<i>(brad)</i> all right!

21:26.351 --> 21:29.119
Hey, guys, don't let go
of that rope! Aah!

21:29.120 --> 21:30.354
<i>(thud)</i>

21:37.028 --> 21:39.897
Oh, I love that play
so much.

21:39.898 --> 21:42.332
I wanna be peter pan
when I grow up.

21:42.333 --> 21:45.936
When you told the audience
to save tinker bell,

21:45.937 --> 21:48.238
I clapped so hard.

21:48.239 --> 21:51.741
Randy, what'd I tell you?
See all those people
looking up at you?

21:51.742 --> 21:54.344
I saw jennifer
looking at me.

21:54.345 --> 21:57.647
She wanted to know
where you bought
your tights.

21:57.648 --> 21:59.316
All right, all right.

21:59.317 --> 22:01.151
You guys fly up to bed.

22:01.152 --> 22:03.153
Don't forget
to brush your teeth.

22:03.154 --> 22:04.454
<i>(randy)</i> night, dad.

22:04.455 --> 22:05.522
<i>(jill and tim)</i>
good night.

22:05.523 --> 22:07.024
<i>(brad)</i> good night.

22:07.025 --> 22:08.325
Jill?
Yeah?

22:08.326 --> 22:10.327
I feel better.
Well, that's good, honey.

22:10.328 --> 22:13.163
Nah. I mean,
I feel a <i>lot</i> better.

22:13.164 --> 22:15.432
<i>(laughs)</i> oh.

22:15.433 --> 22:17.935
Ok, well, um,
you lock up down here,

22:17.936 --> 22:20.938
And I'll go upstairs
and wait for mr. Peacock.

22:20.939 --> 22:22.940
<i>(muttering)</i> got the bad arm
and the bad leg.

22:22.941 --> 22:24.607
Why don't I just lock up?

22:24.608 --> 22:28.111
You can just walk upstairs
and wait for mr. Peacock.

22:29.280 --> 22:32.382
Oh, he left his hat down here.

22:32.383 --> 22:35.419
