[Hannah]
You ’re going to tell me
this one’s no big deal...

00:31.240 --> 00:33.356
but let me tell you about being lone/y.

00:37.450 --> 00:39.361
Humans are a social species.

00:41.410 --> 00:43.492
We rely on connections to survive.

00:47.380 --> 00:50.622
Even the most basic social interactions
help keep us a//ve.

00:51.380 --> 00:52.665
[cheering]

00:56.180 --> 00:58.967
Statistics prove the subjective feeling
of loneliness

00:59.050 --> 01:02.383
can increase the //7(e//hooo'
of premature death by 26%.

01:04.140 --> 01:06.517
If it sounds Me I’m quoting
from a school textbook...

01:08.230 --> 01:09.219
I am.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.186
Too bad noboo’y bothered to read it.

01:14.820 --> 01:16.526
And let me tell you...

01:17.200 --> 01:19.521
there ’5 all kinds of ways to feel lonely.

01:21.700 --> 01:23.827
-[door closes]
-[Lainie] Matt, I was gonna do that.

01:24.080 --> 01:25.741
I thought I'd get you started.

01:25.830 --> 01:27.957
Your workday seems
to be getting longer and longer.

01:31.630 --> 01:33.257
Any news from Clay this morning?

01:33.760 --> 01:35.079
I heard the stirrings.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.255
Some, uh...

01:36.970 --> 01:38.710
thumps and mutterings and such.

01:39.590 --> 01:41.421
We need to get him back to Dr. Ellman.

01:41.850 --> 01:44.842
He won't take the meds,
but the talk therapy was always helpful.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.056
[toaster oven dings]

01:47.730 --> 01:52.099
Aah! Feel like it was more helpful for you
to have him doing it.

01:53.730 --> 01:54.731
Yes.

01:54.820 --> 01:57.391
It was helpful to know
that he was talking to somebody.

01:59.070 --> 02:00.276
What's wrong with that?

02:01.120 --> 02:03.156
Not everyone shares your passionate belief

02:03.240 --> 02:04.992
that all problems
can be solved with words.

02:05.290 --> 02:07.906
Christ's sakes, Matt,
you have a PhD in literature.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.958
-Your whole life is about words.
-And how they complicate everything.

02:11.040 --> 02:13.543
He is in trouble, and we need to help him.

02:13.750 --> 02:16.503
He's acting out, yes.
We don't know that he's in trouble.

02:16.630 --> 02:18.621
There's a reason the school's
sending out so many e-malls.

02:18.720 --> 02:20.585
"Contagion." "Suicide clusters."

02:20.680 --> 02:23.592
A girl died, Lainie,
and he said he barely knew her.

02:24.890 --> 02:26.801
Hannah Baker didn't just die.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.846
She slit her wrists
and bled out in a bathtub.

02:34.570 --> 02:35.639
[Lainie] Clay.

02:37.110 --> 02:38.441
I have to go to school.

02:38.740 --> 02:40.105
I haven't made your lunch yet.

02:40.320 --> 02:41.309
I'll buy lunch.

02:46.330 --> 02:48.742
[Hannah]
I’m not talking the garden variety

02:48.830 --> 02:50.366
lonely in a crowd lone/y.

02:55.550 --> 02:57.450
Thatis everyone, every day.

03:23.740 --> 03:27.483
And it’s not that
”when mil I find love ” kind of lonely.

03:28.330 --> 03:31.242
Or that ”the popular kids
are mean to me ” kind of lonely.

03:32.460 --> 03:34.166
The popular kids are always mean.

03:35.540 --> 03:36.950
Thatis how they get popular.

03:38.340 --> 03:40.160
I know. Ironic.

03:41.170 --> 03:42.467
O/o' news.

03:42.550 --> 03:43.630
[banging]

03:48.930 --> 03:49.806
Hey!

03:49.890 --> 03:52.802
-Hey, what the hell? What are you doing?
-I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

03:52.890 --> 03:53.970
What the hell?

03:54.270 --> 03:55.555
I can't get it open.

03:55.650 --> 03:56.685
Why do you want to?

03:57.230 --> 03:58.970
Because it's my locker.

03:59.070 --> 04:01.812
I'm new, but I can't get
the combination to work.

04:04.780 --> 04:06.407
Sorry, I'm sorry. Uh...

04:07.780 --> 04:10.032
This locker used to belong
to a friend of mine.

04:19.590 --> 04:21.000
Um, thank you.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.802
[Hannah]
The kino’ of lonely I ’m talking about

04:30.060 --> 04:31.971
is when you feel you ’ve got nothing left.

04:34.230 --> 04:35.219
lVothing.

04:36.230 --> 04:37.390
And no one.

04:40.900 --> 04:43.448
t/ke you ’re drowning,
and no one wﬂl throw you a line.

04:45.070 --> 04:46.355
[girl] Why did you do it?

04:48.830 --> 04:50.036
Why did you do it?

04:52.500 --> 04:53.649
Do what?

04:53.960 --> 04:55.075
What you did to Hannah.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.570
That was really fucked up.

04:58.340 --> 04:59.375
What did you say?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.661
I said thanks for helping me.

05:01.760 --> 05:02.954
That was really nice.

05:08.010 --> 05:09.295
Oh. Sure.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.216
Which way is the science wing?

05:12.470 --> 05:14.176
Uh, out those doors. Take a left.

05:17.270 --> 05:20.683
[Hannah]
Well, when the subject
of this tape worked his sneaky magic. . .

05:21.940 --> 05:23.316
that’s how I was feeling.

05:25.240 --> 05:27.231
And when you ’re that kind of lonely,

05:27.320 --> 05:28.776
you reach for anything...

05:29.320 --> 05:31.322
no matter how s/l/y it may seem.

05:31.580 --> 05:33.571
[girl] I'm sick of it, you know?

05:33.660 --> 05:37.039
Just because I don't have her
skinny-ass body doesn't mean I'm fat!

05:38.380 --> 05:41.247
[Hannah]
And communications class
could be supreme/y 5/l/y.. .

05:42.130 --> 05:43.119
as you know.

05:43.210 --> 05:44.507
Maybe she should try a diet.

05:44.970 --> 05:47.256
Seriously, Pratters? Jesus!

05:47.340 --> 05:50.252
I'm just saying, all right,
if you're getting fat-shamed, then...

05:50.760 --> 05:51.749
you know, don't be fat.

05:51.850 --> 05:53.135
[Mrs. Bradley] Mr. Pratters!

05:53.470 --> 05:55.267
Pratter's,
that's like someone saying to you,

05:55.350 --> 05:56.931
"Don't be an idiot and a dickwad."

05:57.190 --> 05:59.055
-Can't help it.
-Exactly. Thank you.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.266
Totally not on your side, dude.

06:04.860 --> 06:05.849
[bell rings]

06:05.940 --> 06:08.602
[Mrs. Bradley] All right, people,
so remember the compliment bags.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.942
Um, it's always best
to give a compliment face to face,

06:12.030 --> 06:13.657
but sometimes it's easier to be anonymous.

06:13.740 --> 06:14.729
All right. See you tomorrow.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.086
I always feel stupid.

06:28.840 --> 06:29.875
Looking?

06:30.090 --> 06:31.079
Yeah.

06:31.260 --> 06:32.249
Yeah.

06:32.430 --> 06:34.386
These are the stupidest,
most embarrassing things

06:34.470 --> 06:36.381
that I check every day, no matter what.

06:36.470 --> 06:37.471
Right.

06:40.350 --> 06:43.649
[Hannah]
Sometimes the 5/l/y things
can mean more than anyone knows.

06:44.110 --> 06:45.099
Get a good one?

06:46.480 --> 06:47.777
Nothing earthshaking.

06:47.860 --> 06:48.940
You?

06:49.530 --> 06:50.519
Nada.

06:52.660 --> 06:54.196
It's kind of soul-crushing, you know?

06:59.000 --> 07:01.036
Seriously? He's Zach Dempsey.

07:01.120 --> 07:02.621
Does he really need compliments?

07:05.380 --> 07:06.495
[Hannah]
We all need it.

07:07.510 --> 07:08.716
Human contact.

07:09.260 --> 07:10.796
And communications class,

07:10.880 --> 07:13.132
crazy as it was,
was human contact for me.

07:14.510 --> 07:16.717
Unt/l someone. in that class
cut my l/fel/ne. . .

07:17.100 --> 07:18.920

07:20.520 --> 07:21.760
I 7/ tell you who it is...

07:22.310 --> 07:23.800
but you ’re going to have to wait.

Just like I did

07:28.740 --> 07:29.809
You don't look so good.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.027
I think I'm listening to my tape.

07:33.740 --> 07:35.696
You're finally gonna get what you deserve.

07:36.450 --> 07:37.360
It's about time.

07:38.870 --> 07:39.689
What?

07:39.790 --> 07:41.826
I said let me know if you need to talk.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.035
Any time.

07:46.540 --> 07:47.541
Yeah, thanks.

I ’m going to play
mind games with you,

07:54.760 --> 07:56.716
just l/ke you played with me.

07:58.180 --> 07:59.670
No. No, 1-1 didn't.

08:00.890 --> 08:02.016
No, I didn't.

08:02.100 --> 08:04.091
["The Great Longing" playing]

08:09.360 --> 08:11.487
[Hannah]
It happened after Valentine’s Day. . .

08:12.070 --> 08:15.233
when you really feel that lack
of human contact.

08:23.210 --> 08:25.747
EspeCIa/h/ when you make contact
with the wrong human.

08:25.830 --> 08:27.627
Get off me! Don't touch me!

Get off!

08:29.590 --> 08:30.875
Hey, what the fuck!

08:30.960 --> 08:31.870
Get away from me.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.210
Thatis a whole new level of lonely.

there are good guys in the world.

08:53.070 --> 08:55.607
As what you believe...

[Hannah]
You were kind that night.

08:57.570 --> 09:00.368
You just sat there,
letting me ignore you...

09:01.200 --> 09:02.781
unt/l it was almost comical.

09:04.540 --> 09:07.282

He can just be such a dick.

09:50.710 --> 09:51.995

you gotta get the positioning just...

10:00.470 --> 10:04.054
I swear, Bryce has a magnet face.
He can keep, like, five on at once.

It's... crazy.

10:07.730 --> 10:08.799
Okay.

You two want to order some food?

10:14.860 --> 10:16.100
Do you want anything?

10:17.360 --> 10:18.941
I mean, after all, it's...

10:20.700 --> 10:22.019
it's still Dollar Valentine.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.240
I think we're just gonna take the check.

it's on me.

that's really nice.

Take it easy.

Okay?

11:03.200 --> 11:04.576
You'll feel better tomorrow.

11:13.790 --> 11:15.621
[Hannah]
You were so sweet

11:16.630 --> 11:18.837
Just like Kat said once upon a t/me.

11:23.970 --> 11:26.598
Well, welcome to your tape, Zach.

11:27.060 --> 11:29.176
-Yo.
-Yo, Big "2"!

For those who aren’tZach, you can relax.

11:36.110 --> 11:37.270
For now, at least.

11:39.030 --> 11:40.145
As for you, Zach...

11:40.990 --> 11:43.732
I wonder if you ever felt
what its hire to be lonely.

11:44.820 --> 11:46.026
t/ke I did that day.

11:48.330 --> 11:51.914
Is it even p055/b/e to know when
you ’re one of the most popular jocks

and not one of those kids
who sits alone in the cafeteria,

11:55.590 --> 11:56.989

12:02.050 --> 12:03.540
Have you ever noticed us?

12:05.600 --> 12:06.885
I can't get my strength!

12:09.180 --> 12:10.841
Take a handful, boys.

12:10.930 --> 12:12.306
Start passing these babies out.

12:12.390 --> 12:13.516
Fuck me!

12:14.940 --> 12:16.805
How many of these did Daddy make you?

12:17.070 --> 12:18.389
Enough to win the election.

12:20.070 --> 12:21.435
Hey, I'll be right back, guys.

12:30.160 --> 12:30.990
Hey.

12:33.410 --> 12:34.240
Hey.

12:35.420 --> 12:36.660
Uh. What you reading?

12:37.630 --> 12:38.449
A book.

12:40.300 --> 12:41.289
[clears throat]

12:41.710 --> 12:42.665
Um...

12:43.930 --> 12:46.216
-Listen, about last night--
-It's okay.

12:46.800 --> 12:47.676
I'm over it.

12:50.390 --> 12:51.300
Okay, this...

12:52.270 --> 12:53.555
this isn't about Marcus.

12:57.810 --> 13:00.222
I never got the chance to say something.

13:02.860 --> 13:03.940
The thing is...

13:05.450 --> 13:07.361
you were the Valentine I was hoping for.

13:08.780 --> 13:09.769
What?

13:10.080 --> 13:12.617
I was hoping that
I'd get your name on my...

13:14.080 --> 13:16.116
you know, the valentine list thing.

13:17.080 --> 13:18.160
Because I'm easy.

13:18.500 --> 13:19.330
No.

13:20.250 --> 13:21.376
Seriously, no.

13:22.920 --> 13:23.830
Look”.

13:24.510 --> 13:25.750
The whole night...

13:26.590 --> 13:28.137
with Marcus and everything...

13:29.350 --> 13:31.466
I couldn't believe you were
on his list and not mine.

13:31.970 --> 13:32.959
Zach...

13:33.390 --> 13:35.722
I don't know if you're doing this
on a dare or whatever.

13:35.810 --> 13:37.050
It's not a dare.

13:37.770 --> 13:38.646
It's not.

13:39.440 --> 13:40.316
Ijust...

13:43.440 --> 13:46.989
I know you think every guy likes you
because you've got this great ass.

13:48.610 --> 13:50.658
But I like you for so much more than that.

13:55.910 --> 13:57.866
Oh, my God, you're such an idiot.

13:58.830 --> 13:59.660
What?

14:00.040 --> 14:00.995
What'd I say?

14:01.090 --> 14:02.876
The fact that you don't even know.

14:02.960 --> 14:04.257
I meant it as a compliment.

14:04.340 --> 14:06.080
Zach, walk away.

14:06.170 --> 14:07.717
Come on,
I know why you're pissed at Marcus--

14:07.800 --> 14:10.007
-Zach, go.
-If you just gave me a chance--

14:10.090 --> 14:11.045
Leave me alone!

14:21.770 --> 14:22.646
Yeah.

14:24.150 --> 14:25.936
Okay. Sorry.

14:29.820 --> 14:31.310
This shit that happens to you...

14:32.330 --> 14:33.900
I think some of it you bring on yourself.

14:34.370 --> 14:35.439
Is that what you think?

14:35.950 --> 14:37.577
Thanks for the insight, genius.

14:37.830 --> 14:38.740
I was...

14:40.580 --> 14:41.786
I was trying to be nice.

14:41.880 --> 14:42.869
Well, you failed.

14:44.130 --> 14:45.119
Well, fuck you.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.630
Dude, seriously.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.716
What's the point of even
attempting with that girl?

14:55.930 --> 14:57.636
Yeah, been there, forgot that.

14:58.100 --> 15:00.056
Don't you need every vote, Marcus?

15:00.140 --> 15:01.266
I don't need that one!

15:01.350 --> 15:03.056
Guys, leave Zach alone.

15:03.730 --> 15:07.143
He's just desperate to lose it before
his dad has to buy him a hooker.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.434
[all laugh]

15:08.690 --> 15:10.191
You get back here, young man!

15:10.280 --> 15:11.269
Zachy!

15:11.360 --> 15:12.361
Poor Zach!

15:12.450 --> 15:13.439
Yo, Zachy!

15:14.160 --> 15:16.071
[Hannah]
You said something stupid Zach. . .

15:16.540 --> 15:17.529
and I yelled at you.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.149
Big deal.

15:22.420 --> 15:23.660
You should ha ve let it go.

15:25.210 --> 15:26.336
But you didn ’t let it go.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.870
You didn ’t l/ke that someone told you no.

15:30.840 --> 15:33.388
’Cause guys l/ke you
get anything you want; r/ght?

15:39.020 --> 15:40.260
[Matt] You're home early.

15:44.190 --> 15:45.009
Hey.

15:45.610 --> 15:47.066
Come sit with me a minute.

16:01.460 --> 16:02.859
This isn't a talk, is it?

16:03.330 --> 16:04.570
No talk.

16:05.630 --> 16:07.495
We'll communicate through semaphores.

16:09.210 --> 16:12.589
I can see how you'd think I'd be the
one person to laugh at that, but...

16:13.840 --> 16:14.829
Where's your bike?

16:17.010 --> 16:17.999
Uh...

16:18.510 --> 16:21.013
I uh... messed up the crank...

16:21.850 --> 16:23.932
so I left it with Tony, to fix it.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.218
Listen.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.350
About what you heard this morning.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.855
I didn't hear anything.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.521
Well, if you did...

16:37.280 --> 16:38.190
your mom and I...

16:40.790 --> 16:42.405
we disagree on some things.

16:42.750 --> 16:44.365
I didn't hear anything, Dad.

16:45.630 --> 16:46.494
Honest.

16:47.170 --> 16:49.161
She thinks maybe you're having
nightmares again.

16:54.840 --> 16:55.829
And if you are...

16:56.550 --> 16:58.632
and if you want
to talk to someone about them,

16:58.720 --> 17:00.881
someone who doesn't share your DNA...

17:01.520 --> 17:02.976
I'll... I'll let you know.

17:07.650 --> 17:09.686
Look, I hated high school.

17:11.110 --> 17:12.486
I couldn't wait to get out.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.026
It was hell for me.

17:17.450 --> 17:18.565
I was a target...

17:20.120 --> 17:21.530
more than once.

17:24.000 --> 17:24.864
Shit.

17:25.670 --> 17:26.659
I'm sorry, Dad.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.069
But I survived.

17:29.710 --> 17:30.870
And look at me now.

17:31.380 --> 17:32.870
I'm a paragon of manhood.

17:34.970 --> 17:36.790
With a fucking beautiful family.

17:40.010 --> 17:40.840
Yeah.

17:41.680 --> 17:42.715
You did all right.

17:44.770 --> 17:45.930
What I'm saying...

17:47.230 --> 17:48.515
I had things to hang on to.

17:48.600 --> 17:49.976
I had chess club,

17:50.060 --> 17:51.061
I had Knowledge Bowl--

17:51.150 --> 17:52.890
See, now you're
embarrassing yourself, Dad.

17:53.400 --> 17:54.606
Do you have something?

17:55.570 --> 17:57.982
Does anything bring you joy?

17:59.820 --> 18:00.866
Or just relief?

18:03.580 --> 18:06.708
Your mom and I would feel
so much better if you had something...

18:08.960 --> 18:11.372
if you took more of an interest in,
you know...

18:12.170 --> 18:13.660
school activities.

18:15.590 --> 18:16.625
You know...

18:18.380 --> 18:20.962
I was actually thinking of going
to the basketball game tonight...

18:21.600 --> 18:22.635
believe it or not.

18:24.220 --> 18:25.300
I have, uh...

18:27.060 --> 18:28.015
a friend playing.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.941
[Hannah]
Maybe you think you deserve
everything you get...

18:45.240 --> 18:46.241
and more.

18:47.290 --> 18:49.781
Maybe you ’re just used to hearing
the cheers of the crowd.

18:51.080 --> 18:52.456
[crowd cheering]

19:09.190 --> 19:10.134
Clay.

19:11.350 --> 19:12.476
What are you doing here?

19:13.270 --> 19:15.647
It's a basketball game.
I'm here to show some school spirit.

19:16.900 --> 19:17.776
That's great.

19:18.190 --> 19:19.145
Great, Clay.

19:19.570 --> 19:20.810
I'm glad you're, you know...

19:21.910 --> 19:22.979
feeling better.

19:23.240 --> 19:24.150
Hey.

19:25.450 --> 19:26.326
How's it going?

19:27.200 --> 19:28.747
Everything's great, Marcus.

19:29.460 --> 19:31.200
What the fuck are you doing here, dude?

19:31.290 --> 19:32.416
What's your play now?

19:33.210 --> 19:34.199
[Tyler] Hey, guys.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.126
Can I get a picture?

19:36.500 --> 19:38.502
Nothing's going on, Tyler. Just go away.

19:38.590 --> 19:40.797
I seriously just wanted
a picture for the yearbook.

19:41.010 --> 19:43.080
If they knew the kind of pictures
you really took!

19:43.180 --> 19:44.169
[Mr. Porter] Hey.

19:44.260 --> 19:45.966
These T-shirts look great.

19:46.470 --> 19:48.347
Uh, I'm glad you approve, Mr. Porter.

19:48.680 --> 19:51.057
I appreciate all the hard work
you guys put into it.

19:51.310 --> 19:52.390
[Marcus] Mr. Down...

19:52.940 --> 19:54.976
would you get a picture of us
for the yearbook?

19:56.070 --> 19:57.059
Yeah.

19:57.900 --> 19:58.719
Yeah.

19:58.820 --> 20:00.060
[clock buzzes]

20:00.150 --> 20:01.447
[audience cheers]

20:04.780 --> 20:05.769
[whistle blows]

20:16.670 --> 20:19.082
Clay, what are you doing?
Get off the court.

20:19.510 --> 20:21.296
Jensen, get off the fucking court.

20:21.380 --> 20:22.620
[audience booing]

20:24.390 --> 20:25.505
What the hell, Jensen?

20:25.590 --> 20:26.841
Game's about to start.

20:29.350 --> 20:30.419
-[whistle blows]
-[crowd erupts]

20:30.520 --> 20:32.511
Hey, you! Get off the court!

20:35.060 --> 20:35.936
[whistle continues]

20:36.020 --> 20:37.510
Get off the court. Go.

20:37.610 --> 20:39.396
Hey, skinny kid,
get the hell off the court.

20:44.530 --> 20:45.940
Clay, you okay?

20:47.280 --> 20:48.326
Do you care?

20:52.080 --> 20:53.456
Where the hell's Jessica?

20:54.250 --> 20:55.239
She texted me.

20:55.330 --> 20:57.161
She was babysitting her brothers

20:57.250 --> 20:59.457
and had to wait
till her mom got home to leave.

21:00.420 --> 21:01.796
Well, we can't wait for her.

21:02.340 --> 21:04.717
Okay, ladies, let's go!

21:04.800 --> 21:06.210
[girls cheering]

21:07.260 --> 21:10.559
[Hannah]
Maybe you can ’t imagine what it
feels like to be on the sidelines, Zach...

21:11.850 --> 21:13.056
l/ke most of us are.

21:13.140 --> 21:14.186
[buzzer]

21:19.520 --> 21:20.851
[bell rings]

21:21.570 --> 21:24.858
You can ’t Imagine why a little
piece of paper could mean so much.

21:29.580 --> 21:31.730
Um, everybody, before you leave,

21:31.830 --> 21:35.322
we've added an anonymous
class discussion bag to the racks.

21:35.410 --> 21:38.038
We're gonna check it every Friday
and talk it over.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.206
You got another bunny?

21:44.300 --> 21:45.585
I wish I would get one.

21:45.670 --> 21:47.001
Still don't know who they're from?

21:51.600 --> 21:53.420
You got, like, six compliments today.

21:53.680 --> 21:56.513
I got a cartoon
and a campaign flyer from Courtney.

21:56.600 --> 21:57.680
Yeah.

21:58.560 --> 22:01.609
You do realize shilling for votes
is not a compliment, Courtney.

22:02.610 --> 22:04.100
I'm sorry you feel that way, Slqe,

22:04.190 --> 22:07.444
but I'm proud of my efforts,
and I wanted to share that with the class.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.446
[laughing]

22:20.920 --> 22:22.330
[crowd cheering]

22:25.840 --> 22:26.829
[Tyler] Hey, Clay.

22:28.380 --> 22:29.677
Go away, Tyler.

22:30.430 --> 22:31.966
You know, I get that a lot.

22:32.390 --> 22:34.176
Especially lately. But today I'm on...

22:35.020 --> 22:37.420
official yearbook business.

22:40.940 --> 22:42.430
Why are you even talking to me?

22:43.730 --> 22:45.607
Because I want to see
what you're gonna do next.

22:46.190 --> 22:48.693
You really messed Courtney up.
Not as much as you did to me.

22:49.410 --> 22:50.399
Still...

22:51.120 --> 22:52.235
the cemetery?

22:52.700 --> 22:53.689
That's cold.

22:56.040 --> 22:57.576
Does everybody know about that?

22:58.500 --> 23:00.320
Everybody knows about everything.

23:00.790 --> 23:02.166
They know about your nightmares.

23:02.250 --> 23:04.161
They know you beat off
to Hannah's picture.

23:04.670 --> 23:06.160
And they know what you did to her.

23:09.260 --> 23:10.249
What is it?

23:11.680 --> 23:12.840
What did I do?

23:14.720 --> 23:15.709
What?

23:18.890 --> 23:19.879
Clay?

23:23.610 --> 23:24.599
Heads up.

23:29.070 --> 23:30.810
Jensen, come on, throw the damn ball.

23:32.280 --> 23:33.269
Clay.

23:33.370 --> 23:34.519
[heart beating]

23:35.490 --> 23:37.037
-C|ay.
-[p|ayer] Come on!

23:37.370 --> 23:39.361
Come on, what are you waiting for?

23:40.120 --> 23:41.667
Throw the ball, dipshit.

23:43.670 --> 23:45.376
Jesus, Clay, what the fuck?

23:47.500 --> 23:48.501
[Tyler] Clay.

23:50.170 --> 23:51.000
Clay.

23:52.300 --> 23:54.348
-C|ay.
-[p|ayer] We got a game, man!

23:54.510 --> 23:56.137
Throw it in, loser!

23:57.510 --> 23:58.636
[crowd laughing]

23:59.430 --> 24:00.806
Thanks for making me do that.

24:01.020 --> 24:02.089
[whistle blows]

24:07.320 --> 24:08.526
Uh-uh. No way.

24:09.070 --> 24:10.981
You've been late to practice
twice this week.

24:11.280 --> 24:13.271
Now you miss most of first quarter?

24:13.530 --> 24:15.691
I'm sorry,
I didn't know I was going to be so late.

24:16.120 --> 24:18.532
Jess, look, you got a problem,

24:18.620 --> 24:20.360
come to me, we'll work it out.

24:20.830 --> 24:23.207
But I'm sorry, you're out of today's game.

24:23.370 --> 24:24.450
[buzzer]

24:35.220 --> 24:36.380
[Bryce] Yo, Jess.

24:36.510 --> 24:37.636
You're not leaving, are you?

24:37.720 --> 24:39.210
I'm benched for the game.

24:39.470 --> 24:41.768
Or didn't the entire gym just hear that?

24:41.980 --> 24:43.436
Well, if you're benched, take a seat.

24:43.520 --> 24:45.590
-Make some room, you guys.
-[Jess] I don't know.

24:46.440 --> 24:48.852
Come on, you don't want to miss
your boyfriend's big game.

24:49.570 --> 24:50.559
And...

24:50.860 --> 24:52.316
we're having fun up there.

24:59.990 --> 25:01.196
[Bryce] Milady.

25:01.290 --> 25:04.248
[Hannah]
Maybe you don ’t know what
it’s l/ke to need a lifeline, Zach.

25:05.170 --> 25:06.159
[bell rings]

25:14.090 --> 25:16.718
The day after you insulted me
in the cafeteria,

25:16.800 --> 25:18.711
my comp/Iment bag was empty.

25:21.220 --> 25:22.596
Not even a cute bunny.

25:23.480 --> 25:24.435
[bell rings]

25:25.100 --> 25:27.341
By the end of the second week,
I knew something was up.

25:36.070 --> 25:38.618
Maybe I should have let it go,
but I oidn ’t.

25:39.450 --> 25:40.690
I wrote you a letter.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.610
I poured my head“ out

25:42.700 --> 25:44.577
opening up about personal things

25:44.660 --> 25:46.821
I hadn’t had the courage
to admit to anyone:

25:47.080 --> 25:48.911
How hard life was getting. . .

25:49.460 --> 25:50.916
how lone/y I felt. . .

25:51.380 --> 25:54.543
and how those stupid compliments
actually meant something to me.

26:04.060 --> 26:05.266
And then I set my trap.

26:19.570 --> 26:21.026
[bell rings]

26:56.610 --> 26:59.238
I was hoping once you read
the letter, you’d get it;

26:59.320 --> 27:02.653
you’d realize how much I needed those
5/l/y things you were stealing from me.

27:06.700 --> 27:08.782
But I guess I wasn ’t even
onh a reaction.

27:13.210 --> 27:14.279
Why me, Zach?

27:15.750 --> 27:16.830
Why me?

27:27.310 --> 27:28.379
[cheering]

27:30.190 --> 27:32.181
Wow, that's double digits already.

27:38.940 --> 27:39.986
[crowd cheers]

27:54.290 --> 27:55.279
Jeez.

27:55.380 --> 27:57.200
Zach is on fire tonight.

28:02.220 --> 28:03.209
Whoo!

28:05.180 --> 28:07.501
[chanting] Zach! Zach! Zach! Zach!

28:20.070 --> 28:21.389
[chanting continues] Zach! Zach!

28:24.490 --> 28:28.779
Oh-ho-ho-ho! Yeah!

28:39.170 --> 28:40.159
Stop it!

28:40.260 --> 28:41.329
Stop! Stop it!

28:41.420 --> 28:43.047
Stop playing! Stop the game! Stop!

28:43.260 --> 28:44.921
Stop it! Stop, stop!

28:54.310 --> 28:55.595
[student] Is he crazy?

29:09.620 --> 29:10.860
[Hannah]
Why me, Zach?

29:11.500 --> 29:12.694
Why me?

29:31.180 --> 29:32.386
[scraping]

29:41.360 --> 29:42.930
[Slqe] Stickin' it to the man!

29:44.070 --> 29:47.449
Or, you know, one particular man
who's rich enough and fucked-up enough

29:47.530 --> 29:49.828
to get his asshole son a $60,000 car.

29:50.580 --> 29:51.945
Slqe, what are you...

29:52.240 --> 29:53.537
Are you at the game?

29:53.950 --> 29:54.996
God, no!

29:57.210 --> 29:58.325
Sculpture studio.

29:58.710 --> 30:01.622
It's the only time I can get
the welding rig away from the shop boys.

30:04.340 --> 30:05.466
Were you at the game?

30:07.380 --> 30:08.381
I was.

30:09.180 --> 30:11.637
But it was so bad,
you had to leave before halftime?

30:15.810 --> 30:16.799
I can't...

30:18.730 --> 30:20.049
I can't do this anymore.

30:21.820 --> 30:22.809
This goddamn school,

30:22.900 --> 30:24.106
it's a terrible place.

30:24.610 --> 30:26.987
You're just now coming
to this realization?

30:28.200 --> 30:30.691
Where have you been for
the past three years?

30:32.330 --> 30:33.479
Oh, that's right,

30:33.580 --> 30:34.945
pining after a pretty dead girl.

30:37.620 --> 30:38.530
Why are you so mean?

30:40.330 --> 30:41.786
I thought we were friends.

30:43.420 --> 30:44.409
Were.

30:45.420 --> 30:46.660
We were friends.

30:48.300 --> 30:49.460
What happened?

30:51.010 --> 30:52.170
I didn't understand it.

30:52.760 --> 30:53.966
I still don't.

30:54.350 --> 30:56.261
Yeah, well, welcome to the world.

30:56.350 --> 30:57.556
Well, I hate it.

30:58.270 --> 30:59.259
Me too.

31:05.690 --> 31:09.353
I like this new... angry,
Audi-keying Clay.

31:10.910 --> 31:11.979
He's got spunk.

31:14.450 --> 31:15.860
I think I'm losing my shit.

31:16.660 --> 31:18.036
Shit's overrated.

31:19.120 --> 31:20.109
Lose it.

31:24.840 --> 31:26.751
I'm gonna be in so much trouble.

31:27.630 --> 31:29.211
Not if no one knows you did it.

31:30.340 --> 31:31.386
You won't tell?

31:31.760 --> 31:33.546
Please, why would I tell?

31:36.520 --> 31:38.420
I think it needs a question mark.

31:48.070 --> 31:49.105
[scraping]

31:57.290 --> 31:58.325
[buzzer]

31:59.370 --> 32:00.359
Oh, shit.

32:00.750 --> 32:02.160
Halftime. I should go.

32:02.420 --> 32:03.489
I'll see you around?

32:03.790 --> 32:05.030
Seems likely.

32:09.710 --> 32:10.711
Hey, Clay.

32:12.220 --> 32:13.209
Stay angry.

32:16.390 --> 32:17.880
[Hannah]
I was feeling desperate,

32:17.970 --> 32:19.926
so I texted someone
I thought was a friend

32:20.980 --> 32:22.629
His Audi? You...

32:23.150 --> 32:24.970
you don't fuck with another dude's car.

32:25.060 --> 32:26.391
I know. I know. I just...

32:28.610 --> 32:29.850
I listened to his tape.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.236
And he just got away with everything.

32:33.320 --> 32:35.311
And he scored, like, 30 points tonight.

32:35.410 --> 32:37.321
You keyed his car
'cause he scored 30 points?

32:37.410 --> 32:39.651
No, because it's not fair, Tony.

32:40.620 --> 32:42.030
It's not fucking fair.

32:45.790 --> 32:47.337
Those tapes are messing me up.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.412
-They're doing shit to my head.
-I get it. I get it.

32:52.010 --> 32:53.079
I don't think you do.

32:53.180 --> 32:54.920
I do. Believe me.

32:55.220 --> 32:56.790
This is all so easy for you.

32:57.140 --> 32:58.801
You don't know what you're talking about.

32:58.890 --> 33:00.050
Then tell me.

33:02.390 --> 33:04.221
You seem like a tall vanilla latte.

33:05.190 --> 33:06.179
I mean, for a drink.

33:08.730 --> 33:09.719
Thanks.

33:09.820 --> 33:10.889
I was just leaving.

33:12.400 --> 33:13.389
Clay.

33:14.320 --> 33:16.060
You're going to get through this.

33:18.990 --> 33:20.116
I don't know if I will.

33:24.000 --> 33:25.240
He's one intense dude.

33:27.170 --> 33:28.706
He's just going through some shit.

33:29.590 --> 33:30.796
Yeah, clearly.

33:31.630 --> 33:32.619
And so are you.

33:36.930 --> 33:38.295
Just tell me one thing:

33:39.550 --> 33:41.381
Tell me all this is not about a guy.

33:43.810 --> 33:44.879
No, it's not.

33:46.310 --> 33:47.299
It's about a girl.

33:55.780 --> 33:57.407
[Hannah]
I texted you, Jessica.

33:57.820 --> 33:59.276
And you said you’d come.

34:00.030 --> 34:01.270
And then you didn ’t.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.006
Want me to clear these?

34:17.340 --> 34:18.716
No, I'm waiting for someone.

34:20.850 --> 34:21.669
Clay?

34:22.260 --> 34:23.511
No, why?

34:25.180 --> 34:26.886
Just seen you around with him.

34:28.060 --> 34:29.049
Not here.

34:30.400 --> 34:31.389
No.

34:32.650 --> 34:33.639
Not here.

34:38.660 --> 34:39.649
I get it; Jess.

34:40.660 --> 34:42.446
I ga ve you a ride home.

34:42.870 --> 34:44.485
That didn ’t make us friends again.

34:49.250 --> 34:51.070
So I guess I didn ’t have any friends. . .

34:52.250 --> 34:53.410
at all...

34:54.460 --> 34:55.290
anymore.

36:04.240 --> 36:05.229
[knocking at door]

36:05.330 --> 36:06.866
[Matt] Clay! Wake up!

36:07.040 --> 36:08.405
You need to come downstairs.

36:13.210 --> 36:14.495
[knocking]

36:14.580 --> 36:15.740
Clay?

36:18.340 --> 36:19.955
Okay, coming.

36:20.050 --> 36:21.119
Now, please.

36:27.100 --> 36:28.249
[Lainie] Clay.

36:29.350 --> 36:31.636
You remember Zach's mom, Mrs. Dempsey.

36:31.770 --> 36:34.182
She stopped by because something happened

36:34.270 --> 36:37.148
to Zach's car
during the game last night and...

36:37.440 --> 36:39.817
she wants to ask you
if you know anything about it.

36:43.990 --> 36:47.619
[Mrs. Bradley] Okay, it's time to look
at our anonymous class discussion bag

36:47.700 --> 36:49.486
and see what we have this week.

36:49.910 --> 36:50.945
[clears throat]

36:51.750 --> 36:53.991
"Mrs. Bradley has nice ankles."

36:54.210 --> 36:55.450
[all laugh]

36:55.790 --> 36:58.953
Well, I'm not sure
that it's appropriate to objectify

36:59.050 --> 37:01.507
anyone in this way,
and certainly not a teacher,

37:01.590 --> 37:04.252
but, uh, in so far as this
was meant as a compliment,

37:04.340 --> 37:05.329
thank you.

37:05.470 --> 37:07.290
They're real nice ankles, Mrs. B.

37:07.390 --> 37:09.756
-[students chuckle]
-[Mrs. Bradley] Moving on.

37:14.270 --> 37:16.977
"What if the only way not to feel bad

37:17.110 --> 37:20.102
is to stop feeling
anything at all, forever?"

37:25.110 --> 37:26.657
Wow. Okay, um...

37:27.490 --> 37:28.570
This is serious.

37:28.660 --> 37:31.572
_This is someone _
who's In a great deal of pain.

37:32.120 --> 37:33.997
Who would like to open our discussion?

37:34.080 --> 37:36.321
Any initial feelings...?

37:36.460 --> 37:38.496
[Hannah]
You had to know I wrote that note, Zach.

37:39.920 --> 37:41.126
And you said nothing.

37:41.420 --> 37:43.251
[Courtney] I think whoever wrote this

37:43.340 --> 37:44.796
is just looking for attention.

37:45.050 --> 37:46.540
Or maybe it's, like,

37:46.630 --> 37:47.631
a call for help.

37:47.720 --> 37:49.961
[Courtney] But then,
why not sign their name?

37:50.510 --> 37:51.761
'Cause it's anonymous.

37:51.930 --> 37:54.512
Maybe it's just a joke,
like someone's just fucking...

37:55.140 --> 37:56.596
Sorry. Messing with us.

37:57.100 --> 37:58.681
-Something.
-[Skye] That's idiotic.

37:59.190 --> 38:00.350
It's not a joke.

38:01.320 --> 38:02.639
How do you know, Slqe?

38:02.900 --> 38:04.606
Because who would joke about that?

38:04.740 --> 38:06.776
Why don't you tell us, Skye.
You see what it was written on?

38:07.410 --> 38:08.650
Don't you work at Monet's?

38:08.740 --> 38:09.559
So?

38:09.660 --> 38:12.288
I don't have a monopoly
over the napkins there, asshole.

38:12.490 --> 38:15.209
Okay, okay, let's not
call people out, all right?

38:15.500 --> 38:17.070
Whoever wrote it was in pain.

38:17.170 --> 38:21.163
So what? They're in pain, I'm in pain.
High school's painful. Get over it.

38:21.250 --> 38:22.410
[Mrs. Bradley] Okay, enough.

38:22.500 --> 38:25.583
I think it was very brave
of this person to tell us

38:25.670 --> 38:26.796
how they're feeling,

38:26.880 --> 38:29.542
and I want them to know
that they are not alone.

38:29.840 --> 38:33.298
There are lots of excellent resources
for people struggling...

38:33.720 --> 38:35.472
[Hannah]
You let everyone think it was Skye.

38:36.980 --> 38:38.641
Why didn ’t you speak up?

38:39.190 --> 38:40.145
[Matt]
I ’m sorry, but...

38:40.440 --> 38:42.931
what makes you think our son
had anything to do with this?

38:43.190 --> 38:45.238
He was at the game, acting strangely.

38:45.990 --> 38:49.153
The ref had to kick him off the court
because he was trying to harass my son.

38:49.280 --> 38:51.566
[Lainie] But nobody saw who keyed the car?

38:51.660 --> 38:52.775
[Mrs. Dempsey] Kids get jealous.

38:52.870 --> 38:55.191
[Lainie] I'm asking you if anyone saw
who keyed the car.

38:55.290 --> 38:57.360
-I don't think he was jealous.
-You hush!

38:57.830 --> 39:00.958
Look, I came here as a courtesy.
I could have called the police.

39:01.040 --> 39:02.530
-Well, maybe you should.
-Lainie.

39:02.630 --> 39:03.449
No.

39:03.710 --> 39:06.508
Maybe they should let the authorities
figure out who did this

39:06.590 --> 39:09.753
instead of coming here pointing fingers
and accusing our son of vandalism.

39:09.840 --> 39:10.670
I did it.

39:10.760 --> 39:13.001
Just because our son
doesn't drive an expenswe car--

39:13.100 --> 39:14.840
-That's not the point here.
-I did it!

39:18.270 --> 39:19.259
I did it, okay?

39:23.860 --> 39:26.988
Karen, Zach, why don't you come inside,
we'll sort this out.

39:30.450 --> 39:32.941
I'd like to talk to Zach for a minute,
if I could.

39:33.410 --> 39:34.479
Absolutely not.

39:34.660 --> 39:35.729
Mom, please?

39:37.580 --> 39:38.740
Two minutes.

39:45.880 --> 39:46.869
Look, I...

39:47.670 --> 39:49.046
I told her to forget about it.

39:49.670 --> 39:52.298
I didn't want to come here
or anything like that.

39:53.430 --> 39:54.419
I'm glad you did.

39:55.260 --> 39:57.842
Let's go inside and explain to your mom
why I keyed your car.

39:57.930 --> 39:59.306
No, Clay, please.

39:59.770 --> 40:01.135
-Don't.
-Why not?

40:01.390 --> 40:02.550
Because.

40:03.900 --> 40:05.219
Well, do your folks know?

40:06.360 --> 40:07.679
About you and Hannah?

40:14.320 --> 40:15.230
Why'd you do it?

40:15.580 --> 40:17.195
I didn't think that she'd react like that.

40:18.200 --> 40:19.326
I mean, come on, Clay.

40:20.330 --> 40:22.070
You knew her as well as anybody else.

40:22.290 --> 40:23.621
That girl was too much.

40:24.460 --> 40:25.870
You knew she needed help.

40:26.920 --> 40:30.469
-When Mrs. Bradley read that note--
-I freaked, okay?

40:32.380 --> 40:33.369
That letter.

40:35.850 --> 40:37.556
That shit was heaw, and...

40:40.730 --> 40:42.129
I didn't know what to do.

40:43.350 --> 40:44.510
So you threw it away.

40:44.690 --> 40:45.679
No.

40:46.150 --> 40:47.856
No, I didn't. Hannah lied about that.

40:49.150 --> 40:51.892
Maybe that's what she saw, I don't know.
I freaked out.

40:56.370 --> 40:57.689
But I never threw it away.

41:00.370 --> 41:01.359
Holy shit.

41:01.660 --> 41:02.786
[Matt] Boys.

41:03.370 --> 41:04.359
Coming.

41:12.380 --> 41:13.460
I'm sorry, Clay.

41:16.760 --> 41:17.886
I'll always be sorry.

41:26.270 --> 41:27.396
Do you want to read it?

41:33.190 --> 41:34.521
I don't think I could.

41:38.780 --> 41:40.407
I don't think I ever could.

41:50.960 --> 41:53.008
[Hannah]
See, I have this theory, Zach.

41:55.970 --> 41:58.086
I have this theory that you ’re lone/y too.

41:58.180 --> 41:59.750
[bell rings]

42:01.760 --> 42:03.057
Could that be possrb/e?

42:05.020 --> 42:08.592
What kind of lonely could
the great Zach Dempsey possrb/y feel?

42:10.360 --> 42:11.930
Dempsey, what the fuck?

42:12.030 --> 42:13.474
We gonna take a long lunch or what?

42:13.900 --> 42:15.310
Uh, yeah, I don't know.

42:18.450 --> 42:20.406
More than that,
we need your wheels.

42:20.490 --> 42:21.479
[laughs]

42:21.580 --> 42:22.695
I gotta go to bio, guys.

42:22.790 --> 42:25.452
Why, so you can cry about a frog again,
you fuckin' pussy?

42:25.540 --> 42:26.905
I didn't cry. Fuck you, man.

42:27.330 --> 42:30.208
Maybe that kind where you think
no one truly sees you.

42:31.840 --> 42:33.330
I know that kind of lonely.

42:34.630 --> 42:35.619
Do you?

42:40.050 --> 42:41.176
” [Matt]
Why me?”

42:41.350 --> 42:44.137
Why... why would Clay write that?

42:46.060 --> 42:49.188
Clearly, someone has
singled him out somehow.

42:49.480 --> 42:52.313
For what? Why would anyone
possibly pick on a kid like that?

42:52.860 --> 42:54.816
He said something to me the other night.

42:54.900 --> 42:57.107
He said, "What if I'm the bully?"

42:58.530 --> 42:59.815
That's not possible.

43:01.240 --> 43:02.275
Are you sure?

43:05.540 --> 43:06.529
Clay.

43:07.160 --> 43:09.287
Your mom and I talked, and...

43:10.290 --> 43:12.667
in addition to paying
for the damages to the car...

43:13.290 --> 43:15.918
we do think there needs
to be some kind of...

43:17.090 --> 43:18.330
grounding situation.

43:19.680 --> 43:20.669
Okay.

43:20.890 --> 43:22.460
For at least two weeks.

43:24.930 --> 43:25.919
Okay.

43:28.060 --> 43:29.049
Okay.

43:30.100 --> 43:31.180
Um...

43:31.690 --> 43:33.601
I finished my half of this project.

43:34.900 --> 43:37.437
I have to give these tapes
to Tony by today.

43:39.320 --> 43:40.526
Could someone drive me?

43:41.910 --> 43:42.774
[Justin]
So...

43:43.120 --> 43:44.269
disappeared last night.

43:45.910 --> 43:47.741
Yeah. That game got sad.

43:48.250 --> 43:49.820
Zach's good. Whoo-hoo.

43:49.910 --> 43:50.990
Who cares?

43:51.080 --> 43:52.126
We left early.

43:53.920 --> 43:54.955
Who's "we"?

43:55.880 --> 43:57.666
Me and Bryce and some other guys.

43:58.710 --> 44:00.337
You couldn't have texted me?

44:00.840 --> 44:02.250
Bryce said he texted you.

44:02.340 --> 44:04.137
Yeah, he texted me to come over,

44:04.220 --> 44:05.426
not that you were there.

44:07.470 --> 44:08.676
You couldn't have hit me back?

44:09.730 --> 44:12.016
You are so not one to ask that,
by the way.

44:12.730 --> 44:13.970
I was in the hot tub, okay?

44:14.060 --> 44:15.891
I didn't have my phone.
What's the problem?

44:16.690 --> 44:18.726
You can live at Bryce's,
but I can't hang out there?

44:18.820 --> 44:20.060
I don't live there now.

44:25.910 --> 44:26.899
[car door closes]

44:31.750 --> 44:32.739
They're all yours.

44:33.960 --> 44:34.949
I'm done.

44:35.630 --> 44:36.779
Take 'em. Share 'em.

44:36.880 --> 44:38.586
Release 'em to the world.
I don't give a shit.

44:38.920 --> 44:40.160
Really? You...

44:40.880 --> 44:41.960
you don't give a shit?

44:42.130 --> 44:43.119
I can't...

44:43.220 --> 44:44.209
I can't anymore.

44:46.050 --> 44:48.553
I can't listen.
I can't hear it in her voice.

44:50.600 --> 44:52.261
People are just mean, Tony.

44:52.770 --> 44:53.976
They're messed up.

44:55.610 --> 44:57.760
Zach didn't throw away the letter,
you know that?

44:58.980 --> 45:00.311
No, I didn't know that.

45:00.480 --> 45:01.686
He showed it to me.

45:02.950 --> 45:04.406
Asked ifI wanted to read it.

45:06.280 --> 45:07.326
And I couldn't...

45:09.200 --> 45:10.485
read it because...

45:12.500 --> 45:14.240
it's starting to make sense to me...

45:15.370 --> 45:16.746
why she did what she did.

45:18.790 --> 45:20.166
I can help you through this.

45:20.840 --> 45:22.410
Can you tell me why I'm on the tapes?

45:23.670 --> 45:26.082
You have to listen.
It's what Hannah wanted.

45:26.180 --> 45:28.045
Yeah, yeah, I know.
What Hannah wanted.

45:28.470 --> 45:30.461
What you're so sure of,
but you won't say how.

45:34.270 --> 45:35.259
Huh?

45:39.690 --> 45:40.679
Fine.

45:40.780 --> 45:41.815
Forget you, then.

45:42.150 --> 45:43.481
Let me help you.

45:44.610 --> 45:46.851
What, like you've been
helping me so far?

45:47.110 --> 45:48.316
No, thanks.

45:49.660 --> 45:50.945
But look on the bright side...

45:51.790 --> 45:53.155
you don't have to follow me anymore.

45:55.670 --> 45:58.412
[Hannah]
No one knows what’s really
going on in another person ’s lr'fe.

45:59.710 --> 46:02.873
And you never know how what you do
w/l/ affect someone else.

46:03.010 --> 46:04.295
Hey, Bryce, what's up?

46:04.760 --> 46:06.079
Hey, Jensen.

46:07.930 --> 46:09.170
And if that goes for me,

46:09.470 --> 46:10.960
it must go for everyone.

46:13.430 --> 46:14.590
Even cheerleaders.

46:15.480 --> 46:16.765
[Clay] Hey, Sheri.

46:16.940 --> 46:18.430
How was the rest of your weekend?

46:18.850 --> 46:19.851
Sorry, what?

46:19.940 --> 46:21.146
You were great at the game.

46:26.780 --> 46:28.520
Jessica. Hey, how are you?

46:29.870 --> 46:30.859
Hey, Clay.

46:32.490 --> 46:34.651
Hey, Justin, good game the other night.

46:40.920 --> 46:42.126
What the fuck is going on?

46:42.460 --> 46:43.620
Who knows anymore?

46:45.800 --> 46:47.165
[P.A. screeches]

46:47.510 --> 46:49.501
[student on P.A.]
Can I have your attention, please?

46:50.590 --> 46:52.501
[Hannah's recording over P.A.]
Hey, it’s Hannah.

46:53.600 --> 46:54.806
Hannah Baker.

[student over P..4.] . . .a
huge congrats
to our 77ger team for Saturday’s win.

47:13.580 --> 47:15.866
A special shout-out to Zach Dempsey,

47:15.950 --> 47:18.407
who crushed it with 28 points.

47:18.500 --> 47:19.956
In other athletic news,

47:20.040 --> 47:21.917
the Lady T/gers won their game

47:22.000 --> 47:24.082
by a score of 54-32.

47:27.300 --> 47:28.665
Thought you said this wasn't a test.

47:29.760 --> 47:31.330
'Cause this looks like a test.

47:31.510 --> 47:33.546
It's not, Mr. Pratters, I assure you.

47:33.640 --> 47:36.677
It is a character-building questionnaire
that assesses

47:36.770 --> 47:38.670
personal strengths and weaknesses.

47:58.250 --> 47:59.615
Excuse me, Mrs. Bradley?

47:59.790 --> 48:00.859
Yes, Clay.

48:01.420 --> 48:03.741
How important was it to you
to help Hannah Baker?

48:06.550 --> 48:09.257
Extremely important to me, Clay.
Why do you ask?

48:11.880 --> 48:14.212
Remember that note you got
in your bag last year?

48:15.890 --> 48:17.846
The one about
not feeling anything anymore?

48:22.270 --> 48:23.430
It was from Hannah.

48:25.610 --> 48:27.976
Okay, uh, why do you think that is?

48:28.070 --> 48:29.185
[door opens]

48:30.400 --> 48:31.389
-Mrs. Bradley?
-Yes?

48:31.490 --> 48:33.560
Sorry to interrupt,
but I need Mr. Jensen.

48:34.200 --> 48:35.485
[Mrs. Bradley] Okay, Mr. Porter.

48:35.570 --> 48:38.152
Clay, we can continue this
discussion at another time.

48:40.120 --> 48:41.906
I have to say, I'm a little surprised.

48:42.830 --> 48:43.865
What? Why?

48:44.210 --> 48:45.416
I know it's been a few weeks,

48:45.500 --> 48:48.128
but you seem like the type of kid
to follow through on a promise.

48:49.260 --> 48:50.295
[Courtney] Don't worry, Clay.

48:50.630 --> 48:52.291
I almost forgot too.

48:53.380 --> 48:54.460
Forgot what?

48:54.550 --> 48:57.292
Courtney and Clay, these are
our new foreign exchange students

48:57.390 --> 48:59.210
joining us this semester.

48:59.430 --> 49:03.719
This is Jhene, Fynn,
Mahla and Deep.

49:03.890 --> 49:06.518
Uh, Courtney and Clay
will be helping you out.

49:06.610 --> 49:09.397
They are on the Honor Board
and they'll be giving you the tour.

49:09.730 --> 49:11.027
The insider's tour!

49:11.280 --> 49:13.692
All the secrets that you need to know.

49:16.700 --> 49:17.985
Okay, great.

49:21.450 --> 49:22.530
I C/ay]
So as you can see,

49:22.620 --> 49:25.418
it's one of the finest high school
parking lots in the world.

49:25.920 --> 49:27.285
Oh, and right here is the library,

49:27.380 --> 49:31.043
where you can find books and tables
and chairs and all that stuff...

49:31.460 --> 49:32.711
state-of-the-art computers,

49:32.800 --> 49:34.791
at least if the art was ten years ago...

49:35.130 --> 49:36.256
and friendly librarians.

49:36.430 --> 49:39.251
Not super bright always, but friendly.

49:42.770 --> 49:44.306
Oh, wait, everyone.

49:44.560 --> 49:47.222
It's Justin Foley and Zach Dempsey,

49:47.310 --> 49:49.266
star basketball players
here at Liberty High.

49:49.360 --> 49:51.681
Hey, Justin, where's my bike?

49:52.110 --> 49:53.236
Justin stole my bike.

49:53.820 --> 49:55.276
What the fuck?
What are you doing?

49:55.360 --> 49:57.351
I'm giving our new
foreign exchange students a tour.

49:57.450 --> 49:59.827
Figured they should know
who owns the school, right, you guys?

49:59.910 --> 50:00.899
Clay.

50:01.040 --> 50:02.325
Right, right. Moving on.

50:02.450 --> 50:03.439
Where were we?

50:03.540 --> 50:04.529
Right. The auditorium.

50:04.620 --> 50:06.201
Oh, oh, but before we go...

50:07.000 --> 50:08.911
I want to show you something super cool.

50:09.460 --> 50:11.337
-Okay?
-C|ay, cut it out.

50:12.050 --> 50:13.586
Look at these lockers.

50:14.170 --> 50:15.717
They all look alike, right?

50:17.760 --> 50:18.579
Not this one.

50:21.060 --> 50:22.209
This one is special.

50:23.140 --> 50:25.051
It belonged to a girl who killed herself.

50:25.270 --> 50:26.476
Clay, come on.

50:26.560 --> 50:29.472
You see all these "don't kill yourself"
posters up on the wall?

50:29.610 --> 50:30.850
They weren't up before.

50:30.940 --> 50:33.272
They put them up
because
she killed herself.

50:33.400 --> 50:34.389
And why did she do it?

50:34.490 --> 50:36.276
Because the kids here
treated her like shit!

50:36.360 --> 50:37.600
[Justin] Jensen, that's enough.

50:37.740 --> 50:39.776
But no one wants to admit it,
so they paint over the bathrooms

50:39.870 --> 50:42.691
and put up a memorial, because that's
the kind of school that this is.

50:42.790 --> 50:45.406
Everyone is just so
_ _ nice _
until they drive you to kIll yourself.

50:45.620 --> 50:47.576
And sooner or later,
the truth will come out.

50:49.630 --> 50:50.699
It's gonna come out.

50:55.300 --> 50:57.712
Right, Tony? Right? You know the truth.

50:58.130 --> 50:59.085
[Mr. Porter] Clay.

51:00.840 --> 51:02.842
I think you should come with me right now.

51:04.180 --> 51:05.977
Get to class, everybody!

51:06.560 --> 51:08.130
All you, get to class.

51:11.440 --> 51:12.646
Welcome to Liberty High.

51:13.650 --> 51:14.639
Let's go.

51:24.450 --> 51:25.439
Okay.

51:26.750 --> 51:27.614
New game.

52:02.990 --> 52:04.480
Well they blew the horns

52:06.580 --> 52:08.036
And the walls came down

52:10.330 --> 52:11.615
They’d all been warned

52:13.830 --> 52:15.331
And the walls came down

52:17.800 --> 52:19.336
They stood there laughing

52:21.090 --> 52:22.796
They’re not laughing anymore

52:25.140 --> 52:26.505
The walls came down

52:32.520 --> 52:34.010
Sanctuary fades

52:43.240 --> 52:44.946
The congregation splits

52:46.870 --> 52:48.826
It’s a song of assassins

52:50.580 --> 52:52.366
Ringin’rn your ears

52:54.380 --> 52:55.950
We got terrorist thinking

52:58.420 --> 52:59.876
Playing on fears
