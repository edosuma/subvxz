WEBVTT

01:48.000 --> 01:50.502
I cannot stop
thinking about death.

01:53.839 --> 01:55.716
Death intrigues me.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.135
The death of children.

01:59.011 --> 02:01.013
The death of friends.

02:03.223 --> 02:05.934
But my own death
continues to elude me.

02:09.520 --> 02:14.860
In my world, it is
believed that the day
of your death is fated.

02:24.369 --> 02:26.580
Would you like to know
the day of your death?

02:28.290 --> 02:31.919
In my world, you must
have a life worth living

02:32.211 --> 02:34.254
before you can
even consider death.

02:35.798 --> 02:40.636
In my world, I am constantly
torn between killing myself

02:42.429 --> 02:44.181
or everyone around me.

02:46.892 --> 02:48.143
I am a slave.

02:50.062 --> 02:52.064
So I have
the same feelings.

03:02.449 --> 03:04.159
A king and a slave.

03:04.910 --> 03:07.412
It is both our
duties to serve others,

03:08.497 --> 03:10.457
whether we
like it or not.

03:39.570 --> 03:40.946
What is your name?

03:47.494 --> 03:48.787
Yidu.

04:02.551 --> 04:04.344
Amen.
Amen.

04:06.221 --> 04:07.848
Amen.

04:07.931 --> 04:12.644
When my friend and ally comes
to call during Advent, alas,

04:13.437 --> 04:15.105
we must fast on gruel.

04:16.315 --> 04:18.024
So, Queen Kwenthrith,

04:18.483 --> 04:20.067
it seems we are
also arrived to

04:20.152 --> 04:22.654
celebrate your
release from captivity.

04:23.322 --> 04:24.364
Yes.

04:25.407 --> 04:27.159
But what does it
mean for Mercia?

04:27.242 --> 04:30.245
And how do we
restore legitimacy to such

04:30.329 --> 04:33.207
a fractured and
wounded kingdom?

04:34.666 --> 04:36.585
Well, you have to invade.

04:36.668 --> 04:40.589
Northumbria and Wessex
together must defeat
the Ruling Council.

04:40.923 --> 04:43.342
And you will
once more be Queen.

04:44.426 --> 04:45.677
Of course.

04:46.595 --> 04:48.055
With you to thank.

04:48.764 --> 04:50.265
And your son Magnus

04:51.350 --> 04:52.976
will be heir to the throne.

04:56.438 --> 04:59.149
The son of Ragnar Lothbrok.

05:01.735 --> 05:05.030
I once swore an oath,
before God and all his angels,

05:05.822 --> 05:09.201
that one day I would
kill Ragnar Lothbrok

05:10.160 --> 05:12.454
in revenge for
his unprovoked and

05:12.537 --> 05:14.790
merciless attack
upon my kingdom.

05:19.795 --> 05:22.464
And would you kill his
bastard son, as well?

05:34.059 --> 05:35.560
Come on!

05:47.072 --> 05:48.699
We bring you the Yule log!

05:49.366 --> 05:51.702
May the gods be praised!

05:55.289 --> 05:59.167
People!
May the Yule log
burn throughout Yol,

05:59.626 --> 06:03.505
and bring its warmth
and light to us in
these darkest of days.

06:03.922 --> 06:06.258
And to King Ragnar
and his family,

06:07.092 --> 06:10.929
may they feel
the warmth of the fire,
like the love of the people!

06:13.473 --> 06:14.558
Yeah!

06:15.267 --> 06:18.145
One, two, three!

06:21.106 --> 06:22.107
More!

06:46.298 --> 06:47.549
Water!

06:56.600 --> 06:59.269
Ivar's awake now.
He is crying for you.

07:21.666 --> 07:23.293
Hey, look out.

07:26.004 --> 07:27.506
I can't wait to go to Paris.

07:27.589 --> 07:29.007
Put it higher.

07:29.091 --> 07:30.759
- Ivar! Hey!
- Ubbe, up.

07:30.842 --> 07:32.928
Look, this is mistletoe.

07:33.553 --> 07:35.847
Do you know what's
special about mistletoe?

07:36.598 --> 07:38.183
It's magical.

07:39.017 --> 07:40.685
Go on.
Careful.

07:41.853 --> 07:43.188
Here's one.

07:43.271 --> 07:44.689
Here, take this.

07:45.190 --> 07:47.401
Good boy, put it in there,
just like your brothers.

07:47.859 --> 07:49.319
Put it in there.
I don't want to.

07:49.403 --> 07:51.613
Good boy. No, you can
do it, it's all right.

07:51.696 --> 07:53.532
- Do it! Don't stop.
- Give him to me.

07:54.741 --> 07:56.701
What are you doing?
He doesn't want to do it.

07:57.536 --> 07:59.955
Stop treating him like there's
something wrong with him!

08:00.622 --> 08:03.250
Let him join in with
the other boys and be
like the other boys.

08:03.333 --> 08:05.377
But he's not
like the other boys!

08:05.460 --> 08:08.130
He's different.
You can't make
him what you want.

08:08.213 --> 08:10.382
You can't make
him like you.
He's not you!

08:10.799 --> 08:13.260
If you treat him
like a cripple,
he will be a cripple.

08:13.385 --> 08:14.886
Don't worry about it.

08:15.887 --> 08:18.014
Ivar's my responsibility,
not yours.

08:20.183 --> 08:22.018
I love him just
as much as you do.

08:22.310 --> 08:23.895
You don't act like it.

08:39.744 --> 08:42.914
Who disturbs my peace now?

08:53.341 --> 08:55.594
So, you finally came.

08:57.888 --> 09:00.599
I have waited a long time.

09:04.186 --> 09:06.438
What do you mean,
"waited a long time"?

09:07.439 --> 09:09.065
Hundreds of years.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.235
While I lay
in the wet ground.

09:13.778 --> 09:17.449
Waiting in the space
between life and death.

09:19.618 --> 09:20.619
Waiting?

09:20.702 --> 09:23.288
You know exactly
what I mean.

09:24.581 --> 09:26.249
Don't play games.

09:27.626 --> 09:30.629
I have waited
and I understand.

09:32.672 --> 09:35.342
Show me that
you understand.

09:35.926 --> 09:38.136
Show me who you are.

10:48.581 --> 10:49.916
Duke Rollo,

10:50.000 --> 10:53.003
by the powers vested in me
by his Holiness the Pope,

10:53.086 --> 10:56.172
I have come to serve
upon you the papers
of annulment,

10:56.256 --> 10:59.134
formally ending
your marriage with
the Princess Gisla.

10:59.759 --> 11:02.053
Since the marriage has
not been consummated,

11:02.470 --> 11:04.848
under Christian law
it does not exist.

11:06.474 --> 11:09.561
Of course I appreciate,
Abbot Lupus, that this

11:10.061 --> 11:12.147
Northman understands me not!

11:12.981 --> 11:14.899
What do you know, old man?

11:15.442 --> 11:19.154
I understand.
I have learned
your language.

11:21.823 --> 11:23.074
Princess Gisla,

11:24.159 --> 11:26.119
I beg you not to do this.

11:26.786 --> 11:30.248
I know my destiny
is to be with you.

11:32.167 --> 11:35.003
And I swear that, like you,

11:35.628 --> 11:38.506
I am prepared to defend
Paris to the death.

11:42.177 --> 11:43.261
Leave us.

11:43.803 --> 11:45.972
I have come all the way
from Rome. Surely...

11:46.056 --> 11:49.225
Surely you will find
refreshments
elsewhere in the palace.

11:49.976 --> 11:52.604
I do thank you for your pains,
such as they are.

12:03.615 --> 12:04.866
Leave us.

12:18.630 --> 12:21.174
So, you have confessed
your love and devotion.

12:23.802 --> 12:25.678
Let me ask you
something, Rollo,

12:26.721 --> 12:28.723
now we can speak
to one another.

12:29.057 --> 12:30.892
And I don't pretend
it hasn't touched me

12:30.975 --> 12:32.811
that you have
learned our language.

12:33.395 --> 12:35.730
Let me ask you what is
more important to you...

12:36.481 --> 12:39.442
Our marriage,
your appointment
by the Emperor...

12:40.985 --> 12:42.570
Or your Viking soul?

12:42.654 --> 12:46.157
Did I not kill
all my own warriors?

12:47.200 --> 12:51.204
Yes, but I think that is a
very Viking thing to do. No?

12:52.497 --> 12:54.457
It wasn't personal.

12:55.166 --> 12:57.085
I don't know if it
meant anything to you.

13:03.091 --> 13:04.759
This means something to me.

13:06.261 --> 13:07.512
This

13:08.263 --> 13:09.556
is personal.

13:12.684 --> 13:14.436
Do with it what you will.

13:31.035 --> 13:33.538
I saw you looking
at my slave, Yidu.

13:40.044 --> 13:41.463
I know you can hear me.

13:51.139 --> 13:53.892
Would you like to spend
some time with her?

13:55.602 --> 13:57.228
If so, I can arrange it.

13:57.562 --> 13:58.980
And I wouldn't mind.

14:00.064 --> 14:01.566
You are free
to go with her.

14:04.068 --> 14:05.445
I won't be jealous.

14:13.995 --> 14:15.955
If that is what you want.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.526
Tell me how you
became a slave.

16:10.236 --> 16:12.238
I know you
weren't born into it,

16:12.822 --> 16:15.366
because you are
clearly not very
good at it.

16:19.912 --> 16:22.373
I was sailing with
members of my family.

16:23.875 --> 16:26.836
Pirates came aboard,
slaughtered some of us,

16:26.919 --> 16:28.755
and others
they kept for sale.

16:29.714 --> 16:32.216
They separated me
from my brothers.

16:32.884 --> 16:34.218
And they...

16:38.806 --> 16:39.891
Raped you?

16:40.558 --> 16:41.809
No.

16:47.065 --> 16:49.442
They did not
dare to rape me.

16:51.235 --> 16:54.447
Why did they not
dare to rape you?

16:57.492 --> 16:59.744
They took me on
a long journey,

17:00.828 --> 17:03.456
for
days and weeks.

17:04.415 --> 17:06.626
And afterwards they
sold me to the Franks.

17:08.252 --> 17:09.962
And now, I am here.

17:11.339 --> 17:13.590
I am here,
wherever "here" is.

17:17.887 --> 17:20.263
And it's so long
since I knew where I was,

17:20.556 --> 17:21.848
or
where I belonged.

17:24.060 --> 17:27.771
I suppose it is stupid
for a slave to
worry over such things.

17:28.898 --> 17:30.274
A slave does
not really exist.

17:49.293 --> 17:51.129
I want to show you something.

19:14.212 --> 19:15.880
What is this place?

19:17.924 --> 19:19.091
Mine.

19:25.181 --> 19:27.934
Although no one else
has ever been here,

19:28.893 --> 19:30.978
it is the only place
I do not feel alone.

19:51.749 --> 19:55.086
If you want, you can come
and go as you please.

19:59.006 --> 20:00.967
And how is that possible?

20:01.425 --> 20:02.927
I am King.

20:04.095 --> 20:06.013
Everything is possible.

20:08.599 --> 20:12.562
And what about my
duties as a slave?

20:13.104 --> 20:14.605
They are
no longer wanted.

20:17.275 --> 20:19.151
You are an awful slave.

20:19.443 --> 20:21.487
I am dismissing
your services.

20:22.321 --> 20:23.698
Is it true?

20:24.407 --> 20:27.118
Yes. You are a useless slave.

20:27.618 --> 20:28.744
No!

20:29.328 --> 20:32.456
That I can come
and go as I please?

20:35.126 --> 20:36.836
Only if you desire to.

20:38.296 --> 20:40.673
If you want,
you can walk
away right now.

24:06.629 --> 24:09.340
Who sent you? Hmm?

24:17.681 --> 24:18.682
Who sent you?

24:21.727 --> 24:23.145
Who sent you?

24:35.241 --> 24:36.575
Who sent you?

25:24.081 --> 25:25.583
- Helga.
- Come in.

25:29.086 --> 25:30.296
What do you want?

25:30.379 --> 25:31.505
Floki, just wait!

25:31.589 --> 25:32.798
And listen!

25:32.882 --> 25:35.634
Isn't it enough that the Queen
has come to our door?

25:41.223 --> 25:42.433
Well?

25:44.351 --> 25:47.855
Floki, I came to deliver
my precious son
into your hands.

25:49.106 --> 25:50.441
This is Ivar,

25:51.609 --> 25:54.111
who I love more
than anyone else alive.

25:57.323 --> 25:59.491
And, Floki,
I know he is clever.

25:59.909 --> 26:02.912
I want you to teach him
the ways of our Gods.

26:04.371 --> 26:06.206
Teach Ivar the true path.

26:07.041 --> 26:10.377
Teach him to hate
the Christian God as
you hate the Christian God!

26:12.630 --> 26:13.964
Only you can do it,

26:14.590 --> 26:15.799
not Ragnar.

26:16.967 --> 26:18.719
I will bring him
to you every day.

26:19.637 --> 26:21.305
Teach him to be a Viking.

26:22.264 --> 26:25.100
Teach him the deep,
and ancient, ways.

26:46.705 --> 26:48.499
I have something for you.

26:49.917 --> 26:53.253
It is an ancient
Chinese medicine.

26:54.505 --> 26:55.839
I am not sick.

26:57.049 --> 26:59.218
But you are
still in pain.

27:01.345 --> 27:02.554
In here.

27:14.984 --> 27:17.111
Do you think I
want to poison you?

28:27.973 --> 28:29.016
Hmm!

30:28.552 --> 30:29.720
Bjorn?

30:42.566 --> 30:43.692
Lagertha.

30:55.162 --> 30:56.413
Kalf.

30:57.414 --> 30:58.415
Erlendur.

31:03.754 --> 31:04.922
Torvi.

31:07.215 --> 31:09.551
We heard you took yourself
away into the wilderness.

31:10.385 --> 31:11.595
Why?

31:14.222 --> 31:16.433
- I went to find someone.
- Who?

31:17.476 --> 31:18.602
Myself.

31:20.270 --> 31:21.605
What is wrong with you?

31:21.980 --> 31:24.024
Bring the son of
Ragnar Lothbrok a drink.

31:25.317 --> 31:26.944
We must celebrate
your arrival.

31:33.659 --> 31:35.869
I would not be so
quick to celebrate.

31:36.954 --> 31:38.705
I have come for two reasons.

31:40.290 --> 31:42.125
First, to see my mother.

31:43.961 --> 31:45.295
Second,

31:46.213 --> 31:48.173
to take Torvi with
me back to Kattegat.

31:50.550 --> 31:52.302
You're talking
about my wife.

31:52.678 --> 31:55.472
She is your wife,
and yet you treat
her like a slave.

31:58.016 --> 32:00.394
Torvi is free to
make up her own mind.

32:01.770 --> 32:03.146
What do you want to do?

32:13.198 --> 32:14.700
I want to go with Bjorn.

32:16.576 --> 32:17.619
Hmm.

32:20.580 --> 32:23.667
Very well.
But you must
leave the child.

32:24.501 --> 32:26.044
Guthrum will
stay with me, huh?

32:26.169 --> 32:28.547
No! No, no!

32:30.424 --> 32:31.883
I cannot leave him!

32:32.551 --> 32:34.928
Then I refuse to release
you from your vows.

32:39.224 --> 32:40.642
I can't.

32:46.440 --> 32:47.691
Bjorn!

32:49.484 --> 32:50.610
Bjorn!

33:02.164 --> 33:04.875
If you want to go with my son,

33:05.042 --> 33:07.044
then go with my son.

33:08.503 --> 33:10.213
I will look after
your child.

33:15.427 --> 33:17.220
We have one life, Torvi.

33:18.013 --> 33:19.431
So go and live it.

33:29.941 --> 33:31.735
A toast! A toast!

33:33.070 --> 33:36.907
To Northumbria,
Mercia, and Wessex.

33:37.866 --> 33:39.951
To allies and friends.

33:40.368 --> 33:42.162
To allies
and friends.

33:42.245 --> 33:45.248
Allies and friends!

33:46.416 --> 33:48.585
And to the three Kings!

33:51.755 --> 33:53.757
Hear, hear! Hear, hear!

34:15.904 --> 34:17.947
You! Take the young
Prince to bed.

34:18.031 --> 34:19.199
Yes, Highness.

34:23.995 --> 34:25.205
Judith!

34:26.373 --> 34:27.791
You take me for a fool?

34:29.000 --> 34:31.920
It is bad enough that,
against all conscience

34:32.003 --> 34:33.588
and against all
that is sacred,

34:33.672 --> 34:35.674
that you have been allowed
to paint the Holy Scriptures.

34:36.091 --> 34:37.259
But now,

34:37.717 --> 34:40.469
I see some gross and
indecent familiarity

34:40.554 --> 34:42.179
between you and
your father-in-law.

34:44.349 --> 34:47.351
My God, to think
that you are my child!

34:48.353 --> 34:51.148
For what are you
but a bad wife,

34:51.481 --> 34:53.233
and a bad mother!

34:53.942 --> 34:56.485
The very worst
example of womanhood!

34:57.612 --> 35:01.366
If Aethelwulf
asked my permission
to beat you into submission,

35:01.867 --> 35:03.910
I would allow it.

35:04.494 --> 35:09.082
My Lord, battered or not,
it would make no difference.

35:09.291 --> 35:13.587
You don't own me, Father,
nor does any man own me.

35:14.504 --> 35:16.381
Though encumbered
everywhere,

35:16.882 --> 35:18.925
I am free.

35:39.029 --> 35:40.238
- Amen.
- Amen.

35:42.449 --> 35:46.369
Where is my daughter?
No one should be
late for Epiphany!

35:53.418 --> 35:54.544
Gisla.

35:55.253 --> 35:56.546
Yes, Father?

35:58.924 --> 36:00.217
Would you join us?

36:01.218 --> 36:02.344
I'm not hungry.

36:03.929 --> 36:07.390
Can I speak to you alone
for a moment, husband?

36:11.478 --> 36:13.230
If you'll excuse me,

36:14.564 --> 36:15.815
Your Highness.

37:10.745 --> 37:12.163
Happy Christmas!

37:13.164 --> 37:14.708
Happy Christmas!

38:46.216 --> 38:47.634
Yol!

38:48.968 --> 38:50.220
Yol!

39:18.415 --> 39:19.791
Oars!

39:22.585 --> 39:23.920
Straight ahead!

39:29.801 --> 39:30.969
Pull!

39:35.932 --> 39:37.475
Mother! Mother!

39:38.101 --> 39:40.562
What is it?
A stranger has come.

39:40.645 --> 39:41.855
A stranger?

39:42.939 --> 39:44.023
Where is he?

39:44.107 --> 39:45.442
He is here.

39:48.278 --> 39:49.446
Queen Aslaug.

39:50.405 --> 39:52.365
Allow me to introduce myself.

39:52.949 --> 39:54.576
My name is Harald

39:54.826 --> 39:57.495
but my people call
me King Finehair.

39:59.622 --> 40:00.790
A king?

40:01.291 --> 40:03.501
Then you are most welcome
to our hearth and home.

40:06.838 --> 40:08.506
Come, warm yourself
by the fire.

40:08.923 --> 40:11.217
My men...
Will be taken care of.

40:14.471 --> 40:17.307
Are you hungry?
Fetch King Harald a drink.

40:21.686 --> 40:23.396
No one travels in winter.

40:24.647 --> 40:26.357
Unless they have to.

40:27.650 --> 40:29.152
Where are you from?

40:29.652 --> 40:31.112
Trunderup.

40:32.739 --> 40:33.990
My kingdom is small.

40:34.782 --> 40:36.326
You will not
have heard of it.

40:37.702 --> 40:39.078
I have heard of it now.

40:41.331 --> 40:44.042
Tell me, King Harald,
why have you come here?

40:45.293 --> 40:47.670
The wanderers sing
praises of your husband.

40:48.505 --> 40:52.050
They tell stories
of his journeys
far and wide.

40:54.802 --> 40:57.805
His raids upon
England and Paris.

40:58.556 --> 41:00.141
He is a famous man.

41:01.184 --> 41:03.478
Why would I not want
to meet him in person?

41:04.103 --> 41:05.396
Sit at his feet

41:06.314 --> 41:07.607
and talk to him?

41:11.611 --> 41:12.862
But where,

41:13.738 --> 41:14.989
may I ask,

41:16.324 --> 41:17.700
might he be?

41:22.205 --> 41:24.082
You will see him soon enough.

41:30.338 --> 41:32.382
That's good.
That's good enough.

41:49.399 --> 41:52.026
Let's play hnefatafl! Huh?

41:52.402 --> 41:53.653
Yes!
Yes?

41:53.736 --> 41:54.904
I'll get the board!

41:55.029 --> 41:56.864
Get the board!
We're playing hnefatafl!

41:56.990 --> 42:00.743
Come on, let's drink!
Let's drink!

42:03.580 --> 42:05.123
I'll play the King!

42:05.623 --> 42:07.792
Oh!

42:11.421 --> 42:12.422
There's my King.

42:15.300 --> 42:16.634
You start!

42:23.766 --> 42:25.810
I'm going to
ask you once more,

42:27.979 --> 42:29.606
why have you
really come here?

42:30.982 --> 42:33.860
I made
someone a promise.

42:33.943 --> 42:34.986
Who?

42:35.695 --> 42:36.821
A girl.

42:38.031 --> 42:39.115
A princess.

42:40.658 --> 42:42.660
I wanted to marry her.
But, uh...

42:44.078 --> 42:45.413
She turned me down.

42:51.628 --> 42:52.754
Be smarter.

42:53.129 --> 42:54.547
Why did she
turn you down?

42:56.174 --> 42:57.759
I wasn't important enough.

42:58.760 --> 42:59.802
She had other offers.

43:05.099 --> 43:06.726
Why didn't you
just take her?

43:08.645 --> 43:10.855
That's a good question,
Queen Aslaug,

43:12.023 --> 43:13.816
but I don't know.

43:15.151 --> 43:16.569
I liked her spirit.

43:18.780 --> 43:21.157
I decided I had to
be worthy of her.

43:23.409 --> 43:24.494
Oh. Bad luck.

43:25.995 --> 43:27.497
How could you do that?

43:32.502 --> 43:34.796
By making myself
King of all Norway!

43:35.129 --> 43:37.590
Then she would
marry me for sure!

43:50.186 --> 43:52.688
But in order to
become King of all Norway,

43:54.315 --> 43:56.692
you would have to
overthrow my husband.

44:02.990 --> 44:04.617
His King...

44:04.700 --> 44:05.743
Is dead.

44:08.204 --> 44:09.789
You lose!

44:11.290 --> 44:13.543
Good game, boys, good game.

44:16.587 --> 44:18.798
Well,
look who's back, alive...

44:20.967 --> 44:22.093
And well.

44:58.504 --> 44:59.881
And you are?
