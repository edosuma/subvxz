BUT WHENEVER HE WANTS

00:28.895 --> 00:29.829
HE CAN SAY BALONEY,

00:29.896 --> 00:30.930

06:30.890 --> 06:32.125
&gt;&gt; I HAVEN'T SEEN YOUR BROTHER.

06:32.191 --> 06:33.092
SOMETIMES, HE GOES TO THE ROOF

06:33.159 --> 06:33.960
TO COUNT PIGEONS.

06:34.026 --> 06:34.427
HE'S CONVINCED

06:34.494 --> 06:35.261
THERE'S NO MORE THAN 20

&gt;&gt; YEAH, I TOLD HIM THAT

06:52.512 --> 06:52.879
&gt;&gt; HEY STU,

06:52.945 --> 06:53.813
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

06:53.880 --> 06:55.081

06:56.315 --> 06:57.383
&gt;&gt; I'VE NOTHING BUT IDEAS.

06:57.450 --> 06:59.218
DOES HE LIKE CHUTNEY?

06:59.285 --> 06:59.952
&gt;&gt; I DON'T EVEN KNOW

07:00.019 --> 07:00.653
WHAT THAT IS?

07:00.720 --> 07:01.454
&gt;&gt; IT'S A FRUITY SAUCE.

07:01.521 --> 07:02.221
IT GOES ON LAMB CHOPS.

07:02.288 --> 07:02.855
IT'S DELICIOUS.

07:02.922 --> 07:05.224
YOU CAN'T STOP EATING IT.

07:05.291 --> 07:05.925
IF YOU CAN'T FIND THAT

07:05.992 --> 07:07.160
GET HIM A SMALL CERAMIC DOG.

07:07.226 --> 07:08.427
MAKES YOU HAPPY ALL DAY.

07:11.998 --> 07:12.431
&gt;&gt; YOU GUYS ARE

07:12.498 --> 07:13.299

07:13.366 --> 07:14.400
I COUNTED 21 PIGEONS

07:14.467 --> 07:15.201
ON THE ROOF.

07:15.268 --> 07:18.237
SOMEONE MUST HAVE HAD A BABY.

07:18.304 --> 07:19.705
&gt;&gt; THERE HE IS.

07:19.772 --> 07:21.974
&gt;&gt; OH, HEY STU.

07:22.041 --> 07:22.909

07:22.975 --> 07:24.177
COME HERE, YOU.

07:24.243 --> 07:26.179
OH, I LIKE YOUR WATCH.

07:26.245 --> 07:27.413
&gt;&gt; I AM NOT WEARING A WATCH.

07:27.480 --> 07:27.814
&gt;&gt; I KNOW.

07:27.880 --> 07:28.481
A KID CAN'T AFFORD GUM,

07:28.548 --> 07:32.418
HOW'S HE GONNA BUY A WATCH.

07:32.485 --> 07:33.219
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT'S COOL

07:33.286 --> 07:34.821
THAT RYAN DOESN'T WEAR A WATCH.

07:34.887 --> 07:35.688
&gt;&gt; YEAH, HE'S ALL,

07:35.755 --> 07:38.090
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS.

07:38.157 --> 07:38.758
&gt;&gt; OKAY, BRO, COME ON,

07:38.825 --> 07:39.725
LET'S GRAB SOME LUNCH.

07:39.792 --> 07:40.693
WHAT'S THE FANCIEST PLACE

07:40.760 --> 07:42.195

07:42.261 --> 07:42.895
&gt;&gt; WELL, THERE'S FINIQUE,

07:42.962 --> 07:43.629
BUT I THINK

07:43.696 --> 07:44.463
YOU NEED RESERVATIONS.

07:44.530 --> 07:44.897
&gt;&gt; REALLY?

07:44.964 --> 07:45.631
IF THE PRESIDENT WALKED IN,

07:45.698 --> 07:46.799
COULD THEY FIND HIM A TABLE?

07:46.866 --> 07:47.366
&gt;&gt; WELL, PROBABLY...

07:47.433 --> 07:48.034
&gt;&gt; I'VE GOT NEWS FOR THEM.

07:48.100 --> 07:49.035
THE PRESIDENT'S IN PRAGUE.

07:49.101 --> 07:58.411
WE'LL TAKE HIS TABLE.

07:58.477 --> 07:59.946
&gt;&gt; HE'S COLORFUL.

08:00.012 --> 08:00.847
&gt;&gt; POOR RYAN'S ALWAYS BEEN

08:00.913 --> 08:02.014
IN HIS SHADOW.

08:02.081 --> 08:02.748
&gt;&gt; TELL ME ABOUT IT.

08:02.815 --> 08:03.482
MY OLDER BROTHER WORKS

08:03.549 --> 08:04.517
AT THE PENTAGON.

08:04.584 --> 08:06.052
&gt;&gt; WOW, WHAT'S HE DO THERE?

08:06.118 --> 08:11.858
&gt;&gt; HE'S A RECEPTIONIST.

08:11.924 --> 08:12.458
&gt;&gt; HEY, I GOT A LEAD

08:12.525 --> 08:13.860
ON A GIFT FOR UNCLE MAX.

08:13.926 --> 08:14.493
I WAS READING

08:14.560 --> 08:15.194
SOME OF HIS MAIL...

08:15.261 --> 08:16.596
&gt;&gt; WAIT, YOU'RE ALLOWED TO READ

08:16.662 --> 08:17.797
OTHER PEOPLE'S MAIL?

08:17.864 --> 08:18.397
&gt;&gt; WELL,

08:18.464 --> 08:19.398

08:19.465 --> 08:20.399
BUT I'M AN OFFICER

08:20.466 --> 08:22.401

08:22.468 --> 08:23.135
ANYWAY, HE'S BEEN GETTING

08:23.202 --> 08:24.403
POSTCARDS FROM UTICA

08:24.470 --> 08:25.905
SAYING UNCLE CHESWICK IS OKAY.

08:25.972 --> 08:27.106
&gt;&gt; WHO'S UNCLE CHESWICK?

08:27.173 --> 08:28.007
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW,

08:28.074 --> 08:29.075
BUT HE LIVES IN UTICA,

08:29.141 --> 08:31.110
AND HE'S OKAY.

08:31.177 --> 08:31.744
&gt;&gt; BUT IF MR. MADIGAN

08:31.811 --> 08:32.245
IS YOUR UNCLE,

08:32.311 --> 08:33.679
WOULDN'T YOU KNOW HIS UNCLE.

08:33.746 --> 08:35.114
&gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT A CRAZY BIG FAMILY.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.415
I'VE GOT 17 FIRST COUSINS,

08:36.482 --> 08:37.416
SIX OF THEM ARE NAMED JEFF

08:37.483 --> 08:39.085
AND ONE OF THEM IS KOREAN.

08:39.151 --> 08:42.421
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

08:42.488 --> 08:43.155
&gt;&gt; HEY, WE SHOULD ARRANGE

08:43.222 --> 08:43.890
FOR UNCLE CHESWICK

08:43.956 --> 08:44.857

08:44.924 --> 08:45.825
THAT WOULD BE A GREAT GIFT.

08:45.892 --> 08:46.492
&gt;&gt; YEAH, WE COULD GET HIM

08:46.559 --> 08:47.560

08:47.627 --> 08:48.094
THEY COULD SIT

08:48.160 --> 08:49.028

08:49.095 --> 08:51.430
HE'S IN PRAGUE.

&gt;&gt; RIGHT THIS WAY?

09:25.364 --> 09:30.937
&gt;&gt; TOO SLOW.

09:31.003 --> 09:32.872
I HOPE THEY HAVE ESCARGOT HERE.

09:32.939 --> 09:33.639
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

09:33.706 --> 09:34.473
SNAILS.

09:34.540 --> 09:35.241
TRUE STORY.

09:35.308 --> 09:35.975
&gt;&gt; YOU EAT SNAILS?

09:36.042 --> 09:36.676
&gt;&gt; NOT REALLY.

MOSTLY, I JUST LINE THEM UP

09:37.910 --> 09:38.511
ON MY PLATE AND PRETEND

09:38.577 --> 09:39.578

09:43.482 --> 09:44.050
WHEN WE USED TO GO OUT

09:44.116 --> 09:45.117

09:45.184 --> 09:50.456
AND WE'D DO THIS.

10:02.268 --> 10:02.735
ANOTHER ONE

10:02.802 --> 10:03.803

&gt;&gt; NO, JUST A LITTLE GIFT

10:05.204 --> 10:06.038
FOR MR. MADIGAN.

10:06.105 --> 10:06.639
&gt;&gt; I BET IT'S NOT

10:06.706 --> 10:07.840
HALF AS GOOD AS MINE.

WELL, TOO BAD, YOU CAN'T GO IN

10:09.976 --> 10:10.943

10:11.010 --> 10:12.678
THE GOLDEN APPLE IS FROM ME

10:12.745 --> 10:14.046

10:14.113 --> 10:14.880
&gt;&gt; BY THE WAY, AMANDA,

HERE'S THE BILL FOR THAT THING.

10:16.415 --> 10:17.016

10:17.083 --> 10:18.417
WHO WANTS IT?

10:18.484 --> 10:20.252

10:28.894 --> 10:31.530
I'VE GOT SOME NEWS, BIG NEWS.

10:31.597 --> 10:32.898
&gt;&gt; LET ME GUESS.

10:32.965 --> 10:33.699
THEY'RE MAKING YOU

10:33.766 --> 10:34.734
VALEDICTORIAN.

10:34.800 --> 10:35.735
&gt;&gt; BIGGER.

10:35.801 --> 10:36.302
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE WINNING

10:36.369 --> 10:37.503
SOME SORT OF GENIUS AWARD?

10:37.570 --> 10:38.738

10:38.804 --> 10:39.305
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE NAMING

10:39.372 --> 10:40.272
A BUILDING AFTER YOU.

10:40.339 --> 10:41.040

10:41.107 --> 10:45.311
&gt;&gt; WHAT?

10:51.851 --> 10:52.385
&gt;&gt; BUT THAT'S ALL

10:52.451 --> 10:53.052
YOU'VE EVER WANTED TO DO.

10:53.119 --> 10:54.553
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.

10:54.620 --> 10:55.354
ALL THESE BUSINESS GUYS

10:55.421 --> 10:56.288
WOULD COME IN AND LECTURE,

10:56.355 --> 10:57.857
AND THEY ALL HAD FANCY SUITS

10:57.923 --> 10:59.525

10:59.592 --> 11:01.527
BUT NONE OF THEM SEEMED HAPPY.

11:01.594 --> 11:05.097
&gt;&gt; SO, WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO?

11:05.164 --> 11:06.732
&gt;&gt; REALLY WANT TO BE AN ARTIST.

I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

11:15.207 --> 11:15.708
I'M NOT GOING TO BE

11:15.775 --> 11:17.510
DAD'S BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT.

11:17.576 --> 11:28.087
CAKE FOR EVERYBODY.

11:28.154 --> 11:28.587
&gt;&gt; WHY DIDN'T

11:28.654 --> 11:29.255
MR. MADIGAN'S UNCLE

&gt;&gt; I'LL BE BACK

11:43.436 --> 11:45.738

11:45.805 --> 11:49.008
&gt;&gt; THANKS.

11:49.075 --> 11:49.642

11:49.708 --> 11:50.743

12:33.319 --> 12:34.019

12:34.086 --> 12:34.620
MAYBE THEY COULD TAKE

12:34.687 --> 12:35.654
A CARRIAGE RIDE.

12:35.721 --> 12:36.188
&gt;&gt; THOSE THINGS

12:36.255 --> 12:37.523

12:41.427 --> 12:43.496

12:44.330 --> 12:44.964
&gt;&gt; AT LEAST, HE SEEMS

12:45.030 --> 12:46.599
REALLY GENTLE.

12:46.665 --> 12:48.634
&gt;&gt; OH, OH.

12:48.701 --> 12:51.270
&gt;&gt; IS THAT THING EATING MY HAIR?

13:00.880 --> 13:04.817
&gt;&gt; PERFECT, JUST PERFECT.

13:04.884 --> 13:06.018
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

13:06.085 --> 13:06.619
&gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE ASKING ME

13:06.685 --> 13:07.253
IF YOU REMIND ME

13:07.319 --> 13:08.320

13:08.387 --> 13:10.189
THEN NO.

13:10.256 --> 13:15.027
&gt;&gt; POLISH IT, TROLL.

13:15.094 --> 13:16.162
&gt;&gt; HEY OSCAR, CAN YOU SHOW ME

13:16.228 --> 13:17.530
WHERE THE GIRLS' ROOM IS?

13:17.596 --> 13:19.331

13:19.398 --> 13:20.766
&gt;&gt; I FORGET

13:20.833 --> 13:22.401
AND IT'S, SORT OF AN EMERGENCY.

13:22.468 --> 13:23.269
I DON'T WANNA GET GROSS,

13:23.335 --> 13:24.236
BUT I ATE A PLATE OF SEAFOOD

13:45.324 --> 13:52.298
COME ON, UNCLE C.

13:52.364 --> 13:54.233

13:54.300 --> 13:55.234
&gt;&gt; TRUE, I SUSPECT

13:55.301 --> 13:56.135
YOU'RE GETTING ME A GIFT.

13:56.202 --> 13:57.336

14:06.245 --> 14:07.146
MUST HAVE HAD A FAVORITE HORSE

14:07.213 --> 14:08.180

14:08.247 --> 14:09.315
&gt;&gt; NO.

14:09.381 --> 14:11.684
I HAD ONE HORSE MANY YEARS AGO,

14:11.750 --> 14:13.385
UNCLE CHESWICK.

14:13.452 --> 14:14.420
&gt;&gt; I'LL BET YOU MISS

14:14.486 --> 14:15.387
THAT OLD HORSE, HUH?

14:15.454 --> 14:16.188
&gt;&gt; NOT AT ALL.

14:16.255 --> 14:17.690
THAT CHESTNUT WAS INSANE.

14:17.756 --> 14:18.824
THAT'S NOT AN EXPRESSION,

14:18.891 --> 14:21.160
HE WAS LITERALLY INSANE.

14:21.227 --> 14:22.061
&gt;&gt; UH-HUH.

14:22.127 --> 14:22.995
&gt;&gt; AND MEAN.

14:31.136 --> 14:32.071
LOOK, AS MUCH AS I LOVE

14:32.137 --> 14:33.038
TO STAY AND CHAT,

14:33.105 --> 14:34.640

14:41.780 --> 14:43.148
&gt;&gt; OSCAR, HAVE YOU SEEN

14:43.215 --> 14:44.316
ANYTHING WEIRD?

14:55.394 --> 14:56.295
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IS WEIRD?

14:56.362 --> 14:56.829

&gt;&gt; WELL, I CAN'T REALLY TALK.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.151
I'M LOOKING FOR A HORSE.

SO SUSPICIOUS,

16:25.317 --> 16:26.118
ARE YOU HIDING SOMETHING?

16:26.185 --> 16:26.618
&gt;&gt; YES.

A LITTLE?

WILL UNDERSTAND.
