01:23.875 --> 01:26.586
Ah, closing time.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.505
I'm out of here.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.924
Looks like you're in charge now, tomcat.

01:38.056 --> 01:42.101
You better make sure nothing happens
to me record store.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.278
See you in the morning, Thomas.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.721
Welcome to the Hole in the Wall.

02:23.810 --> 02:24.978
Hey, no pigeons.

02:26.145 --> 02:27.105
Mice only.

02:27.772 --> 02:29.899
I'm the bouncer.

03:46.976 --> 03:48.519
What's wrong with the music?

03:50.271 --> 03:52.190
Hey, move the crowd, DJ.

05:57.815 --> 06:00.359
<i>Go, Jerry. Go, Jerry. Go, Jerry.</i>

06:02.111 --> 06:05.448
<i>Go, Jerry. Go, Jerry. Go, Jerry.</i>

06:20.463 --> 06:21.714
Let me see your ID.

06:24.717 --> 06:27.136
A Norwegian rat?

06:27.762 --> 06:30.598
You're a little large, even for a rat,
ain't you?

06:32.975 --> 06:35.478
All right, you can go in.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.193
Hey, back off.

06:48.658 --> 06:51.744
You dirty rat. You scuffed my sneakers.

06:51.744 --> 06:54.747
Nobody scuffs my sneakers
and gets away with it.

06:55.414 --> 06:57.667
Oh, you're in big trouble.

06:59.335 --> 07:01.754
Oh, snap! It's a cat!

07:05.049 --> 07:07.593
Hey, no cats allowed.

07:21.357 --> 07:22.942
What have you done to my store, man?

07:23.484 --> 07:25.278
That's it, cat. That's it.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.279
You are gone!

07:38.499 --> 07:44.422
Spike, I know I can count on you
to guard my store.

08:58.579 --> 08:59.872
Listen up, Slim.

09:00.373 --> 09:04.835
You got two seconds
before I call Animal Control.

09:09.340 --> 09:14.929
Is that your cologne or did you take a bath
in a garbage dumpster?

09:17.056 --> 09:20.017
Hey, man,
we're like two pieces of wood.

09:20.017 --> 09:22.979
You're a stiff and I'm bored.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.485
Is that for me?

09:29.485 --> 09:32.363
Oh, he's adorable!

09:32.363 --> 09:36.409
You have to be the cutest little thing
I've ever seen.

09:36.909 --> 09:40.162
Mwah.
- Slim, you're like old bread.

09:40.162 --> 09:41.998
Stale.

09:55.344 --> 09:57.638
I've always wanted my own pet.

09:58.264 --> 10:02.226
Does my little mousy-wousy
want a nice hot bath?

10:06.022 --> 10:08.691
Now you just sit here and relax.

10:08.691 --> 10:12.403
I'll bring you something sweet to eat.

10:58.699 --> 11:04.622
Ooh, mousiekins, ain't musicians
just totally the coolest?

11:10.127 --> 11:12.963
Hey, come on. Let's get out of here.

11:26.268 --> 11:31.482
<i>All right, meow, oh, you so nice</i>

11:31.482 --> 11:35.319
<i>Meow, oh, you so nice</i>

11:35.319 --> 11:39.240
<i>I asked my doctor for his advice</i>

11:40.449 --> 11:42.743
<i>"Pick up the phone and don't think twice"</i>

11:43.369 --> 11:45.913
<i>I got fur so smooth</i>

11:45.913 --> 11:47.331
<i>And I play to win</i>

11:47.873 --> 11:51.460
<i>When I call on you, you won't let me in</i>

11:51.460 --> 11:59.301
<i>Meow, oh, you so nice</i>

11:59.301 --> 12:03.347
<i>I asked my doctor for his advice</i>

12:03.347 --> 12:06.517
<i>"Go on over and don't think twice"</i>

12:07.309 --> 12:11.439
<i>I got a stray-cat strut
That makes the girls cry</i>

12:12.064 --> 12:15.401
<i>When I come to your house
You just say, "Bye-bye"</i>

12:21.532 --> 12:25.995
Slim, you better not be
messing with my mousiekins.

12:47.057 --> 12:48.893
<i>Cat calling</i>

12:48.893 --> 12:52.563
<i>Cat calling on you</i>

12:54.899 --> 12:57.151
<i>You make me weak at the knees</i>

12:57.151 --> 13:01.280
<i>And I don't know what to do</i>

13:01.280 --> 13:06.494
Slim, I just love your voice.

13:26.889 --> 13:29.266
Mousiekins, what are you doing?

13:37.608 --> 13:39.360
Stop!

13:44.031 --> 13:46.200
No, my precious china!

13:52.665 --> 13:55.960
Slim, I want you out of my house now!

14:20.317 --> 14:22.903
Did you hear me? I said, get out of here!

14:30.911 --> 14:33.330
<i>I used six of my lives</i>

14:33.330 --> 14:35.291
<i>Trying to get to your door</i>

14:35.291 --> 14:39.211
<i>If I can't make you mine
I still got three more, baby</i>

14:39.211 --> 14:43.465
<i>Meow, oh, you so nice</i>

14:58.355 --> 15:02.109
<i>Meow, oh, I am so nice</i>

15:02.109 --> 15:06.030
<i>You asked the doctor for his advice</i>

15:06.030 --> 15:10.159
<i>Walk away and don't think twice
Mm-mm</i>

15:37.770 --> 15:43.692
Tonight, who will win the favor of me,
<i>el presidente...</i>

15:43.692 --> 15:47.529
...by dancing for the golden guitar?

15:49.031 --> 15:51.158
Oh, come now.

15:51.158 --> 15:57.831
Surely someone can impress me
with their magnificent dancing skills, eh?

16:05.923 --> 16:09.009
Se単or Tom,
you are going to dance for me?

16:41.291 --> 16:42.668
Ooh!

17:29.757 --> 17:32.217
Bravo! Bravo!

19:24.621 --> 19:27.833
Se単or Tom is <i>mucho</i> talented.

19:27.833 --> 19:31.545
I think I shall award him
the golden guitar.

19:52.149 --> 19:57.237
Oh, never before have I seen
such incredible dancing skills.

19:57.988 --> 20:02.576
For the golden guitar,
I proclaim there shall be...

20:03.660 --> 20:04.912
...a dance off.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.636
The place, she is coming down.

21:02.636 --> 21:03.804
Run! Run!

21:24.491 --> 21:26.535
My palace.

21:28.829 --> 21:34.501
Se単or Tom, never have I seen
such dancing before.

21:34.501 --> 21:37.004
This is the golden guitar.

21:37.004 --> 21:40.882
And I am going to let you have it.

21:43.093 --> 21:45.637
You've got it coming.

21:45.637 --> 21:48.223
You've earned it.

21:48.223 --> 21:52.436
You have destroyed my palace!

21:52.436 --> 21:54.521
All right, Se単or Tom.
