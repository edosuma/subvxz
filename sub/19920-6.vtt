WEBVTT

00:01.224 --> 00:02.359
You think you own me now?

00:02.391 --> 00:03.999
You think I want to talk
about what's been going on?

00:04.022 --> 00:05.751
20 years on the force, Calvert.

00:05.787 --> 00:08.590
I'm gonna reserve my
congratulations until it's official.

00:09.020 --> 00:10.139
Assaulting an officer?

00:10.164 --> 00:11.188
Get off me!

00:11.257 --> 00:13.921
I'll do my best to keep this
incident out of the system.

00:14.053 --> 00:16.626
You do what I do, you
realize we're born bad.

00:16.696 --> 00:17.762
What about your daughter?

00:17.830 --> 00:19.398
She's the only good thing in my life.

00:19.423 --> 00:21.432
I'm going back to D.C.
for a custody hearing.

00:21.501 --> 00:23.301
Why didn't you tell
me Cox Group Financial

00:23.369 --> 00:24.802
was financing

00:24.871 --> 00:26.470
your education initiative?

00:26.539 --> 00:28.039
Our state prisons are overcrowded.

00:28.075 --> 00:30.059
Overcrowded with my people.

00:30.091 --> 00:33.075
I know how much Gate
Station means to you.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.661
Together, we can keep our city

00:34.686 --> 00:36.216
from becoming another Ferguson.

00:36.247 --> 00:38.301
Sergeant Derkin was
partnered with Breeland.

00:38.373 --> 00:40.435
You see anything the night
Joey Campbell was killed?

00:40.443 --> 00:41.708
It was Breeland's crime scene.

00:41.733 --> 00:42.865
You must have talked to him.

00:42.904 --> 00:44.111
So you were there.

00:44.180 --> 00:46.413
That guy's got a lot of
guilt, more than he can carry.

00:46.449 --> 00:47.481
I think I can turn him.

00:49.351 --> 00:50.351
That's him!

00:51.135 --> 00:52.464
That's the man who shot Joey.

00:56.174 --> 00:58.074
Make sure you come
straight home after school.

00:58.109 --> 00:59.308
Won't be home till 5:30.

00:59.377 --> 01:00.977
I have math study group, remember?

01:01.045 --> 01:02.289
All right, then meet me at Chosen House.

01:02.313 --> 01:03.424
We'll grab a bite after, all right?

01:03.448 --> 01:04.447
All right, bye.

01:05.547 --> 01:06.816
You forgetting something?

01:12.187 --> 01:14.320
Don't worry. None of your little
girlfriends on the bus saw you.

01:14.344 --> 01:15.397
All right.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:33.178 --> 01:37.680
What about Joey? What about Joey?

01:41.428 --> 01:44.262
What about Joey? What about Joey?

01:46.652 --> 01:47.857
That's your fam.

01:50.750 --> 01:52.328
We ask for programs for the poor,

01:52.397 --> 01:55.398
they turn our neighborhoods
into a police state.

01:56.451 --> 01:58.243
We ask for better schools,

01:58.942 --> 02:00.426
they give us prisons.

02:01.541 --> 02:03.875
We need an uprising.

02:03.904 --> 02:05.641
Like Baltimore.

02:05.710 --> 02:06.976
Like Ferguson.

02:07.045 --> 02:08.477
Like Detroit.

02:09.234 --> 02:11.030
But we need a different fire this time.

02:11.925 --> 02:15.650
We need our fire to burn
down police brutality.

02:16.562 --> 02:18.321
Burn down racism.

02:18.893 --> 02:20.488
Burn down injustice.

02:21.366 --> 02:25.364
Burn down everything the
flag on this wall represents.

02:25.597 --> 02:28.865
This is a riot

02:29.209 --> 02:31.900
of ideas and action.

02:31.977 --> 02:35.035
The fire this time will be
stoked by love, not hate;

02:36.120 --> 02:37.986
Truth, not lies;

02:38.560 --> 02:40.162
Peace, not violence!

02:43.898 --> 02:45.097
Get off me!

02:51.471 --> 02:53.361
It's easy to throw a bottle.

02:54.377 --> 02:56.941
It takes wisdom to know
why you want to throw it.

02:58.604 --> 03:01.228
And courage to know why you shouldn't.

03:03.750 --> 03:05.391
When we're united,

03:05.599 --> 03:07.929
anything is possible.

03:09.635 --> 03:11.672
If you share that belief,

03:11.697 --> 03:13.815
join me at Chosen House.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.460
All right, Pastor!

03:15.528 --> 03:17.129
Turn your anger

03:17.589 --> 03:19.399
into action.

03:23.775 --> 03:25.070
You can go now.

03:25.822 --> 03:27.405
Ain't nobody gonna hurt you.

03:30.443 --> 03:33.211
Justice for Joey!

03:34.180 --> 03:37.282
Justice for Joey! Justice for Joey!

04:04.177 --> 04:06.811
Derkin was at Mason
County PD for two weeks,

04:06.879 --> 04:08.674
then he drives himself into a lake.

04:09.382 --> 04:10.715
Why?

04:11.134 --> 04:12.601
This is his confession.

04:13.620 --> 04:14.986
He was there.

04:15.473 --> 04:16.887
Saw who killed Joey.

04:17.366 --> 04:18.990
Couldn't handle it.

04:24.397 --> 04:26.564
A signed confession would have been nice.

04:27.088 --> 04:28.599
Now Cory's the only one left

04:28.668 --> 04:30.353
who can identify the
shooter as Arlen Cox.

04:30.778 --> 04:32.178
Richest man in the state.

04:32.210 --> 04:33.954
Platt conveniently left
his name off the list

04:33.978 --> 04:36.312
of auxiliary deputies in the program.

04:37.728 --> 04:38.809
They're scared.

04:40.864 --> 04:42.370
I say we go after Arlen.

04:43.095 --> 04:45.250
You shoot at the king,
you better not miss.

04:45.864 --> 04:48.365
He's gonna use his
money and his influence

04:48.433 --> 04:50.700
to discredit our witness, me, you,

04:50.776 --> 04:51.875
whatever it takes.

04:51.937 --> 04:53.211
You take Cox.

04:53.505 --> 04:54.832
I'll talk to Governor Eamons.

04:55.207 --> 04:56.787
The Tours are her program.

04:57.042 --> 04:58.575
Arlen is her biggest supporter.

04:59.631 --> 05:01.183
We'll find out what she knows.

05:03.983 --> 05:06.279
Don't shoot! Justice for Joey!

05:06.319 --> 05:08.019
Out of the way!

05:09.405 --> 05:10.338
Don't do that.

05:10.406 --> 05:11.806
What's up?

05:11.875 --> 05:13.437
This place is a powder keg.

05:16.913 --> 05:18.212
Hey!

05:20.955 --> 05:22.717
Justice! Justice!

05:25.865 --> 05:27.365
We celebrate

05:27.434 --> 05:28.866
this groundbreaking

05:28.935 --> 05:31.703
of this most modern correctional facility

05:32.052 --> 05:33.380
because of you.

05:34.140 --> 05:37.342
Not only will this generate

05:37.410 --> 05:40.878
hundreds of jobs and
revenue across the state,

05:40.947 --> 05:43.314
but we think that this is a model

05:43.383 --> 05:45.650
for all the correctional facilities

05:45.719 --> 05:48.886
that will be built in the years to come

05:48.955 --> 05:50.655
across this nation.

05:55.829 --> 05:58.683
Mr. Terry, I assume you didn't
come for the hors d'oeuvres.

05:58.708 --> 05:59.640
I'm afraid not.

05:59.665 --> 06:01.165
I'm here to talk to you

06:01.190 --> 06:02.723
about your Community Patrol Program.

06:02.818 --> 06:03.818
What about it?

06:04.237 --> 06:05.703
What's your level of involvement?

06:05.772 --> 06:08.346
It was a perk for a few of my top donors,

06:08.979 --> 06:11.109
the opportunity to become deputized.

06:11.177 --> 06:12.478
Seeing how law enforcement

06:12.525 --> 06:14.379
works up close helps raise money

06:14.447 --> 06:16.158
for the department and some
of my other initiatives.

06:16.182 --> 06:18.134
Are you aware of the
abuses within the program?

06:18.651 --> 06:19.684
Abuses?

06:19.753 --> 06:20.885
What is this about?

06:20.920 --> 06:22.553
We have reason to believe

06:22.622 --> 06:24.622
the program may be linked
to Joey Campbell's death.

06:24.895 --> 06:27.591
What could possibly make you think that?

06:27.660 --> 06:29.127
We have a witness who identified

06:29.195 --> 06:30.895
one of your volunteer auxiliary deputies

06:30.964 --> 06:32.420
as Joey Campbell's killer.

06:34.679 --> 06:36.682
Give me a chance to look into this.

06:41.969 --> 06:44.140
We're gathering information on The Tours.

06:44.898 --> 06:46.171
"The Tours"?

06:47.723 --> 06:50.075
That's an interesting turn of phrase.

06:50.514 --> 06:52.344
It's a splendid program.

06:52.413 --> 06:54.179
So you admit you were involved.

06:54.248 --> 06:55.314
Admit?

06:56.054 --> 06:57.815
I am proud of it.

06:59.308 --> 07:01.225
Being a volunteer deputy

07:01.639 --> 07:04.292
has given me a first-hand appreciation

07:05.193 --> 07:08.213
for how people like you
could make a difference.

07:08.964 --> 07:10.979
I'm only sorry that my schedule is such

07:11.018 --> 07:13.598
that I can't participate
as much as I'd like to.

07:14.138 --> 07:16.987
Sheriff Platt failed to mention
you ever participated at all.

07:17.044 --> 07:18.410
Any idea why?

07:18.442 --> 07:20.183
It was some time ago.

07:20.507 --> 07:22.423
Perhaps he's just giving you

07:23.616 --> 07:25.155
the most recent information.

07:25.319 --> 07:26.460
How long is "some time"?

07:26.485 --> 07:27.619
Two months.

07:27.688 --> 07:29.017
Fortunate timing.

07:29.288 --> 07:30.288
Why?

07:32.132 --> 07:33.258
It means you weren't there

07:33.327 --> 07:34.866
the night Joey Campbell was killed.

07:38.151 --> 07:39.264
You wanted to see me, sir?

07:39.333 --> 07:40.265
Good.

07:40.334 --> 07:41.533
Shut the door.

07:48.958 --> 07:50.895
Mason County Sheriff called.

07:52.703 --> 07:54.145
Derkin killed himself.

07:56.905 --> 07:59.515
Drove his car into a lake.

08:01.973 --> 08:03.383
Hell of a thing.

08:21.908 --> 08:23.475
You gonna be okay?

08:29.870 --> 08:31.069
You come with me.

08:33.053 --> 08:34.554
And try to act surprised.

08:38.457 --> 08:40.215
Surprise!

09:06.920 --> 09:07.920
I just...

09:08.622 --> 09:10.789
I just wanted to look into your eyes.

09:14.007 --> 09:15.916
I needed to come here and face you.

09:19.220 --> 09:22.096
Now, I'm not going to ask
you why you killed my son

09:23.083 --> 09:25.904
because I know you'll lie.

09:28.296 --> 09:29.306
I'd be able to tell,

09:31.945 --> 09:33.945
and neither one of us would survive that.

09:41.267 --> 09:42.294
But...

09:44.254 --> 09:45.757
I want to know...

09:48.096 --> 09:49.563
Did he suffer?

09:53.896 --> 09:56.801
What were his last words?

10:00.598 --> 10:02.900
Did you tell him that you were sorry?

10:10.851 --> 10:12.250
He didn't suffer.

10:19.822 --> 10:21.212
I hope you do.

10:23.330 --> 10:24.512
With all my heart,

10:27.092 --> 10:29.462
I hope you suffer every day of your life.

10:48.109 --> 10:50.953
Were any of our volunteer
auxiliary deputies

10:50.980 --> 10:53.207
involved in the death of Joey Campbell?

10:53.270 --> 10:54.840
Absolutely not,

10:54.871 --> 10:56.738
and I'm offended by the accusation.

10:56.808 --> 10:58.385
I don't give a damn
about you being offended.

10:58.409 --> 11:01.489
The DOJ believes a program I created

11:01.577 --> 11:03.433
was misused by your department.

11:03.470 --> 11:04.879
They have a witness.

11:05.285 --> 11:07.459
Their witness has zero
credibility, Governor.

11:07.498 --> 11:09.098
They seem to disagree.

11:09.167 --> 11:10.934
They are nowhere with
the Jesse Carr case,

11:10.969 --> 11:13.933
so they're grasping at anything
to make themselves seem useful.

11:13.983 --> 11:16.406
There's absolutely no
validity to their claims.

11:16.475 --> 11:18.675
There are two dead boys on my watch,

11:18.744 --> 11:20.777
and I'm going to have to
answer to their mothers.

11:20.846 --> 11:24.281
I expect you to cooperate fully
with the Department of Justice

11:24.349 --> 11:25.582
on both cases.

11:26.076 --> 11:28.191
With all due respect, Governor...

11:29.606 --> 11:31.606
there would be no DOJ investigation

11:31.641 --> 11:33.874
if you'd listened to
me and allowed my office

11:33.943 --> 11:36.410
to handle the Jesse Carr
matter in the first place.

11:36.691 --> 11:38.855
If I thought your office
could handle this case,

11:38.856 --> 11:41.058
I wouldn't have had to
bring in an outside group.

11:41.126 --> 11:43.203
Gate Station is bleeding

11:43.711 --> 11:46.830
and Deputy Beck is still a
member of your department.

11:47.672 --> 11:50.199
And you wonder why I
question your leadership.

12:00.204 --> 12:01.640
What's up, Campbell?

12:01.665 --> 12:04.113
Damn, all the drama in the
city, it's about your brother.

12:04.183 --> 12:05.382
You're like a celebrity.

12:22.694 --> 12:24.603
You heard about Sergeant Derkin?

12:26.940 --> 12:27.998
Yes, sir.

12:29.384 --> 12:31.202
He always used to say

12:32.122 --> 12:33.966
the integrity of the badge

12:34.613 --> 12:36.003
was his God.

12:37.282 --> 12:39.065
I guess I can relate.

12:39.418 --> 12:40.432
Me, too.

12:43.150 --> 12:44.564
I think more than most.

12:44.814 --> 12:47.014
Joshua, as long as you're in uniform,

12:47.083 --> 12:49.951
unwanted attention will be
directed at all officers.

12:50.504 --> 12:52.786
For the integrity of the department

12:53.733 --> 12:55.272
and for yourself, I'm placing you

12:55.616 --> 12:58.883
on administrative leave with pay

12:59.687 --> 13:00.952
until this is resolved.

13:01.924 --> 13:03.259
I guess due process is for everyone

13:03.283 --> 13:05.216
but the ones upholding the law?

13:06.049 --> 13:07.815
If anybody else had said
what you said on that video,

13:07.839 --> 13:09.472
I would have fired their ass.

13:16.136 --> 13:18.042
Would you like me to
finish out the day, sir?

13:18.817 --> 13:21.286
I need you to turn over
your badge and your firearm.

13:44.510 --> 13:46.844
It never crossed your
mind to give me a heads up?

13:47.092 --> 13:48.758
Is that what you're expecting from this?

13:49.145 --> 13:51.089
I expect not to be blindsided.

13:51.120 --> 13:52.189
I don't know what you know.

13:52.213 --> 13:53.245
You really think

13:53.284 --> 13:55.052
that I would know something like that

13:55.121 --> 13:57.922
and not put a stop to it immediately?

13:59.292 --> 14:00.602
And how did you even
know about the donors

14:00.626 --> 14:02.421
to connect him to the program?

14:02.422 --> 14:03.499
I happened to glance down at your laptop

14:03.523 --> 14:05.031
when we were together.

14:06.272 --> 14:07.615
You glanced over?

14:08.725 --> 14:09.891
You violated my privacy.

14:09.926 --> 14:11.559
I didn't violate anything.

14:11.628 --> 14:13.862
I looked down and I saw a
name on your open laptop.

14:13.930 --> 14:15.274
So stealing information
and being unethical

14:15.298 --> 14:16.542
is just another day
at the office for you?

14:16.566 --> 14:18.211
I don't appreciate you
calling me unethical.

14:18.235 --> 14:19.870
And I don't appreciate you.

14:21.438 --> 14:22.637
Not anymore.

14:40.657 --> 14:42.357
You're leaving?

14:42.426 --> 14:44.592
Yeah, thanks to you.

14:45.293 --> 14:46.895
I had nothing to do with it.

14:46.963 --> 14:48.430
Yeah, keep telling yourself that.

14:49.966 --> 14:51.166
We need to talk.

14:53.169 --> 14:54.540
Off the record.

14:56.673 --> 14:57.939
Not here.

15:04.948 --> 15:06.648
Glad you could make it.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.153
I think you'll find this interesting.

15:21.731 --> 15:23.784
So you're saying no jail time?

15:24.202 --> 15:25.935
You help us and we'll help you.

15:31.542 --> 15:33.641
- I worked for Joey.
- Doing what?

15:33.807 --> 15:34.813
Selling.

15:36.104 --> 15:37.413
Who'd you sell to?

15:39.784 --> 15:42.318
That white kid from
the news that got shot.

15:42.386 --> 15:43.419
Jesse.

15:44.889 --> 15:46.989
So Joey and Jesse

15:47.058 --> 15:49.325
would have had the same strain of weed.

15:49.393 --> 15:50.526
Of course.

15:50.595 --> 15:53.262
You opened a DOJ
investigation on Joey Campbell

15:53.331 --> 15:54.875
because you claimed their deaths
were connected, am I right?

15:54.899 --> 15:56.031
Well, now you know.

15:56.100 --> 15:57.199
There is no cover up.

15:57.268 --> 15:58.500
If there's no cover up,

15:58.569 --> 15:59.880
why did you leave Arlen Cox's name

15:59.904 --> 16:01.114
off your list of auxiliary deputies?

16:01.138 --> 16:03.606
Joey gave weed to this kid.

16:03.674 --> 16:05.574
This kid sold it to Jesse.

16:05.610 --> 16:07.543
You were on a wild goose chase then.

16:07.612 --> 16:11.046
Now you're on a wild goose
chase with the Community Patrol.

16:11.082 --> 16:12.581
Your superiors will hear from me.

16:28.855 --> 16:30.513
Hearing at 5:30?

16:32.003 --> 16:33.243
Look, I don't want you to worry

16:33.271 --> 16:35.006
about this place or anything else.

16:36.223 --> 16:37.973
Focus on what you've got to do.

16:39.543 --> 16:41.484
You love your daughter.
Anyone can see that.

16:42.867 --> 16:44.576
You just gotta let that judge in.

16:46.325 --> 16:48.484
You know I wouldn't be
leaving for anything else.

16:48.796 --> 16:50.152
I know.

16:52.052 --> 16:53.455
See you soon, boss.

16:53.524 --> 16:54.765
I'll see you.

17:32.500 --> 17:34.484
We don't drink in front of the boys.

17:36.634 --> 17:37.900
They're taking a nap.

17:41.739 --> 17:43.319
You need to talk to somebody.

17:44.190 --> 17:45.274
Go see somebody.

17:45.343 --> 17:46.722
You think this helps?

17:57.555 --> 17:59.021
Mrs. Beck.

17:59.928 --> 18:01.194
I'm Preston Terry.

18:01.230 --> 18:02.375
I know who the hell you are.

18:03.227 --> 18:04.589
What do you want?

18:05.500 --> 18:08.130
Kerry, let him in.

18:22.585 --> 18:23.712
Have a seat.

18:38.195 --> 18:41.630
Hey, can... can we have
a little bit of, um, privacy?

18:42.996 --> 18:44.048
Please?

18:56.213 --> 18:57.602
No, thanks.

19:00.084 --> 19:00.960
That's right.

19:00.985 --> 19:02.538
You're on the job.

19:04.188 --> 19:05.321
I told you.

19:05.352 --> 19:06.518
It's off the record.

19:07.054 --> 19:08.772
Nothing's ever off the record.

19:09.547 --> 19:11.645
I had nothing to do with your suspension.

19:12.878 --> 19:14.543
All I ever wanted,

19:15.760 --> 19:17.355
all I want, is the truth.

19:17.772 --> 19:19.155
Well, the truth is

19:21.030 --> 19:23.326
you wouldn't be here
if I shot a black kid.

19:24.538 --> 19:25.640
No one would.

19:26.175 --> 19:28.008
I mean, a black man
killing another black man

19:28.077 --> 19:29.548
isn't sexy enough.

19:31.548 --> 19:33.049
What about your conscience?

19:34.991 --> 19:36.695
I mean, would it tell
you anything different

19:36.719 --> 19:38.052
if the kid was a different color?

19:38.121 --> 19:40.421
They took my
conscience a long time ago.

19:40.490 --> 19:41.589
Then take it back.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.764
Tell me about Joey.

19:52.286 --> 19:53.511
The Tours.

19:54.263 --> 19:56.171
Who was out that night? Derkin?

19:56.757 --> 19:57.772
Arlen?

19:58.806 --> 19:59.835
Breeland?

20:00.600 --> 20:01.764
Who shot Joey?

20:08.570 --> 20:12.461
Look, maybe you forgot
what color you are,

20:14.262 --> 20:15.935
but I'm reminded every day.

20:16.793 --> 20:19.193
I mean, my uniform doesn't protect me

20:19.262 --> 20:21.228
the same way that it
does them white boys.

20:21.297 --> 20:24.532
I've been the only one in
the room my entire life.

20:25.204 --> 20:26.901
I know what that is.

20:27.648 --> 20:29.370
But my success is a middle finger

20:29.439 --> 20:32.184
to anyone who ever tried
to make me feel less than.

20:33.665 --> 20:36.322
So stop feeling sorry for
yourself and fight back.

20:37.046 --> 20:38.046
Nah.

20:39.048 --> 20:41.949
We're supposed to just take
it no matter how much it hurts.

20:44.438 --> 20:48.255
And, finally, when you give
up, finally, when you decide

20:48.324 --> 20:50.858
that you're gonna stand
up and be a man, you...

20:52.462 --> 20:53.462
And what?

20:54.214 --> 20:55.317
What happens then?

20:57.799 --> 20:58.933
Beck...

21:02.140 --> 21:04.238
When you said you had a
license to kill crackers,

21:04.307 --> 21:06.140
was that a joke or a confession?

21:09.310 --> 21:10.878
Get out of my house.

21:27.444 --> 21:28.610
Hey.

21:29.482 --> 21:30.658
Where's Kai?

21:30.720 --> 21:31.853
Listen, Ashe...

21:32.259 --> 21:33.492
Where's my daughter?

21:34.495 --> 21:35.828
There's been a change of plans.

21:35.863 --> 21:36.863
What?

21:36.897 --> 21:38.163
This is Miss Hadad.

21:38.232 --> 21:40.849
She's a court-appointed guardian.

21:41.235 --> 21:43.195
It's gonna be a supervised visit.

21:43.674 --> 21:45.313
What the hell is this?

21:46.962 --> 21:49.341
I'm here to observe the
familial relationship

21:49.410 --> 21:50.576
between you and your daughter

21:50.644 --> 21:52.700
and make a recommendation to the judge.

21:52.732 --> 21:54.265
I don't give a damn who appointed you.

21:54.290 --> 21:55.856
You're not babysitting me and my kid.

21:57.685 --> 21:59.325
Look, I'm sorry.

21:59.350 --> 22:00.886
I'm not trying to overreact,

22:00.911 --> 22:01.831
I just...

22:01.856 --> 22:03.055
Mommy!

22:03.124 --> 22:06.725
- I miss you so much!
- Hey!

22:06.794 --> 22:07.993
I miss you.

22:11.426 --> 22:13.932
I miss you so much!

22:14.001 --> 22:17.959
I miss you too, tremendous!

22:21.275 --> 22:23.146
Come on, I made you something.

22:24.025 --> 22:25.178
You did?

22:27.515 --> 22:28.700
Is it beets?

22:29.049 --> 22:30.161
Ew!

22:30.551 --> 22:32.094
Guess what hand it's in.

22:32.119 --> 22:33.119
This one?

22:33.258 --> 22:34.887
Maybe.

22:34.955 --> 22:35.988
This one?

22:36.056 --> 22:37.222
Maybe.

22:37.291 --> 22:38.733
It can't be in both hands.

22:46.033 --> 22:47.800
What's that? You made this yourself?

22:49.960 --> 22:52.600
It's mostly purple, our favorite color.

22:52.992 --> 22:55.092
'Cause of all the colors in the rainbow,

22:55.161 --> 22:57.759
it has royalty...

22:58.351 --> 23:00.622
And magic...

23:00.623 --> 23:02.289
And...

23:02.358 --> 23:04.024
Mystery!

23:05.607 --> 23:06.973
Mommy!

23:07.503 --> 23:08.909
I love you, too.

23:09.281 --> 23:10.477
I love my bracelet

23:10.512 --> 23:12.310
and I'm never gonna take it off, okay?

23:12.634 --> 23:14.701
Okay.

23:14.950 --> 23:17.752
What about Joey? What about Joey?

23:17.776 --> 23:19.776
_

23:19.800 --> 23:21.800
What about Joey?

23:21.990 --> 23:23.156
Justice for Joey!

23:23.927 --> 23:26.096
I've called for a news
conference in an hour

23:26.135 --> 23:27.395
to help keep the peace.

23:27.396 --> 23:29.091
Mr. Mayor, I'd like you to be there.

23:29.128 --> 23:30.772
We are way past news
conferences, Governor.

23:30.796 --> 23:32.470
We're just setting
ourselves up for attack.

23:32.494 --> 23:33.559
We need order.

23:33.628 --> 23:34.559
Law enforcement

23:34.607 --> 23:36.218
from three other counties
have been brought in.

23:36.242 --> 23:37.975
I've reached out to community leaders

23:38.044 --> 23:39.310
to help keep the peace.

23:39.379 --> 23:40.928
I have not ruled out a curfew.

23:40.971 --> 23:43.338
Have you even been watching
the news? That's not enough.

23:43.363 --> 23:45.954
You need to declare a state of emergency.

23:45.979 --> 23:47.446
Be proactive, Governor,

23:47.514 --> 23:49.481
before these thugs out
there burn our entire...

23:49.549 --> 23:52.473
Those people have a right to protest.

23:53.019 --> 23:55.486
If these isolated incidents give way

23:55.555 --> 23:57.419
to a more violent atmosphere,

23:57.458 --> 23:59.625
our law enforcement will
become more proactive.

23:59.655 --> 24:01.321
I believe in 24 hours,

24:01.390 --> 24:02.815
the situation will be under control.

24:02.816 --> 24:04.249
I certainly hope so.

24:04.795 --> 24:07.111
I would hate to think
that these disturbances

24:07.136 --> 24:09.564
would interfere with
Sunday's football game.

24:09.637 --> 24:11.871
That would be a fiduciary nightmare.

24:11.940 --> 24:14.397
But in the spirit of pessimism,

24:14.398 --> 24:15.797
I have an associate

24:15.866 --> 24:18.834
who provides prisoner transport for me,

24:18.903 --> 24:22.638
and he has offered to the
state an armored vehicle...

24:22.673 --> 24:24.072
What? No!

24:24.141 --> 24:27.668
I am not declaring war on my citizens.

24:27.669 --> 24:30.372
Your citizens have already
declared war on you.

24:32.106 --> 24:35.541
If you're looking for somebody
to tell you don't be angry,

24:36.228 --> 24:37.744
you're in the wrong place.

24:40.223 --> 24:41.714
I know you're hurting,

24:42.390 --> 24:45.077
and no one seems to care about your pain.

24:46.982 --> 24:49.088
No matter how intense your cries,

24:49.858 --> 24:52.735
they refuse to hear you.

24:53.194 --> 24:54.260
Amen.

24:56.737 --> 24:59.027
You have been voiceless for so long,

25:01.266 --> 25:02.935
you've not only forgotten how to speak,

25:03.004 --> 25:05.604
but you've become incapable of listening.

25:07.467 --> 25:09.542
But the voiceless will learn to speak

25:09.610 --> 25:12.645
in ways that cannot be misunderstood.

25:16.534 --> 25:19.048
Your needs may go unheard
by those in power,

25:19.103 --> 25:21.376
but brothers and sisters,

25:21.771 --> 25:23.805
you are not silent.

25:25.066 --> 25:27.480
Your voice will be found

25:28.026 --> 25:32.009
in the tears of a mother who
was forced to bury her child.

25:34.793 --> 25:38.298
It is in the desperation
of our sons and daughters

25:38.323 --> 25:41.003
whose dreams are denied on a daily basis,

25:41.487 --> 25:44.072
and in the remnants of their dreams

25:44.545 --> 25:47.498
that are destroyed long before the bullet

25:47.524 --> 25:48.790
shattered their body.

25:48.930 --> 25:51.638
It is in our father,

25:52.109 --> 25:55.033
who is fighting for his family's

25:55.102 --> 25:57.536
dignity and respect

25:57.604 --> 26:00.847
in the face of unrelenting hate,

26:01.969 --> 26:05.601
fear, and indifference.

26:05.646 --> 26:08.175
The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King said

26:09.094 --> 26:13.335
that a riot is the
language of the unheard.

26:13.954 --> 26:15.950
If that is true,

26:16.223 --> 26:20.425
if our voices be silenced,
our spirits broken,

26:20.494 --> 26:22.894
if we have no other
choice to speak to power

26:22.963 --> 26:25.597
and power has neither the
desire nor the will to listen,

26:25.632 --> 26:29.765
then Dr. King's words will
no longer be a warning,

26:32.166 --> 26:33.739
but a prophecy.

26:33.807 --> 26:35.647
And what seemed to begin
as a peaceful protest,

26:35.676 --> 26:36.908
has now resulted in...

26:36.977 --> 26:38.396
Governor, would you like
to hold the press conference

26:38.420 --> 26:39.720
in the media room or in your office?

26:39.744 --> 26:41.472
Cancel the press conference.

26:43.556 --> 26:44.556
Yes, ma'am.

26:44.585 --> 26:45.917
Taken immediate action

26:45.986 --> 26:47.552
regarding the escalating tension

26:47.621 --> 26:49.661
between hundreds of protestors
taking to the streets

26:49.690 --> 26:52.591
and a police force who
may soon be overrun.

26:53.340 --> 26:55.501
And when that happens,
it'll be too late...

26:59.281 --> 27:02.210
for language to matter.

27:11.557 --> 27:14.435
You were partnered together to
work the cartels in Columbia.

27:14.475 --> 27:15.959
Incredibly dangerous work.

27:16.021 --> 27:18.031
I applaud you both for
your courage and service.

27:18.100 --> 27:19.411
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Thank you.

27:19.435 --> 27:21.368
Mr. Cano, you're still with the DEA,

27:21.437 --> 27:22.936
but you no longer work in the field.

27:23.359 --> 27:26.373
Yeah, my desk job allows me

27:26.442 --> 27:29.176
to be a consistent presence
in my daughter's life.

27:29.244 --> 27:32.245
Ms. Akino, I imagine
being an investigator

27:32.314 --> 27:33.380
requires frequent travel

27:33.449 --> 27:35.082
and time away from home.

27:35.432 --> 27:36.916
I'm very capable

27:36.952 --> 27:39.753
of balancing both my
job and being a mother.

27:39.784 --> 27:41.756
I imagine it can also be perilous work.

27:42.228 --> 27:44.288
I can handle myself, if
that's what you're asking.

27:44.829 --> 27:46.694
Actually, it was an observation.

27:46.910 --> 27:48.943
Mr. Cano, according to your complaint,

27:49.012 --> 27:52.080
Ms. Akino has difficulty
managing her anger.

27:52.614 --> 27:53.753
When...

27:55.546 --> 27:57.729
you're dealing with bad people,

27:58.245 --> 28:00.675
you have to meet them
where they're at, so, um,

28:01.251 --> 28:03.207
you're straddling two worlds.

28:03.984 --> 28:06.585
And sometimes, I think
it's difficult for her

28:06.653 --> 28:09.176
to bring her other foot back.

28:09.201 --> 28:10.356
Are you kidding me?

28:10.381 --> 28:11.632
What the hell are you saying?

28:11.677 --> 28:13.019
You threw a vase at her,

28:13.020 --> 28:14.530
and it happened when
Kai was in the house.

28:14.554 --> 28:16.164
She yelled at her...
That's okay with you?

28:16.165 --> 28:18.065
- No, it's not okay.
- Please address me

28:18.133 --> 28:19.599
and not each other.

28:20.155 --> 28:21.735
She yelled at my daughter.

28:22.180 --> 28:24.204
And I threw the vase by her, not at her.

28:24.273 --> 28:26.106
From what the guardian
ad litem has observed,

28:26.175 --> 28:28.518
she has genuine affection for Ms. Perez.

28:28.519 --> 28:30.119
It doesn't mean she takes my place.

28:30.187 --> 28:32.086
Your fitness as a mother
is the only question

28:32.206 --> 28:33.555
before this court.

28:33.951 --> 28:34.689
Now, I don't believe

28:34.759 --> 28:36.868
in separating a child from
a parent, but if I find

28:36.920 --> 28:39.121
it's in the best
interest of your daughter,

28:39.189 --> 28:40.856
I won't hesitate to do so.

28:40.968 --> 28:42.817
That's just the point, Your Honor.

28:43.345 --> 28:45.861
I was raised by my dad
after my mother left.

28:47.109 --> 28:49.475
When I was 16, he got sick

28:49.530 --> 28:52.267
and had to be hospitalized
for almost a year.

28:53.531 --> 28:54.960
I was put in foster care,

28:55.092 --> 28:57.780
and even though the family
who raised me was nice,

28:57.840 --> 28:59.346
they weren't my parents.

28:59.347 --> 29:00.880
I didn't look into their eyes

29:00.947 --> 29:01.947
and see myself.

29:04.084 --> 29:05.771
When I smile at her,

29:06.330 --> 29:08.310
Kai sees her reflection.

29:10.883 --> 29:13.024
When she's afraid or when she's sad,

29:13.060 --> 29:16.314
she needs me to make the
world safe and happy again.

29:17.597 --> 29:19.440
No one can give her what I can,

29:20.611 --> 29:23.468
no matter how much
they might care for her

29:23.537 --> 29:26.438
or how much affection
they might have for her.

29:27.807 --> 29:30.669
When she calls out for me, she needs me.

29:33.012 --> 29:34.712
And if I'm not there for her,

29:34.781 --> 29:36.566
she might not be there for herself.

29:38.201 --> 29:40.635
Miss Akino, I am moved by your words,

29:41.076 --> 29:43.805
but I don't have the
luxury of determining cases

29:43.874 --> 29:45.568
based solely on emotion.

29:46.088 --> 29:48.309
Now, while you have
finally sought counseling,

29:48.378 --> 29:50.145
the report from the psychiatrist

29:50.213 --> 29:52.900
does little to support
a ruling in your favor.

29:53.248 --> 29:55.431
He says that you have possible PTSD,

29:55.490 --> 29:57.052
which must be addressed.

29:57.489 --> 29:59.320
Now, I will review all these items

29:59.389 --> 30:01.658
and make my decision
by the end of the month.

30:25.241 --> 30:26.340
Your boy's out there.

30:28.029 --> 30:29.209
Where's he at?

31:07.249 --> 31:08.549
You ain't got to do this, man!

31:08.617 --> 31:09.883
No, no, no.

31:22.565 --> 31:23.630
Shut that thing off!

31:23.699 --> 31:25.732
What are you doing, damn it?!

31:41.150 --> 31:44.151
Justice for Joey! Justice for Joey!

31:47.733 --> 31:50.154
_

31:50.740 --> 31:51.892
Shawn!

31:53.642 --> 31:54.674
Shawn!

31:55.288 --> 31:56.311
Shawn?

31:56.335 --> 31:57.581
What you doing?

31:58.890 --> 32:00.090
Derrick!

32:00.445 --> 32:01.524
Derrick!

32:01.593 --> 32:02.759
Miss Campbell!

32:02.828 --> 32:03.983
Where's Shawn?

32:04.008 --> 32:05.374
I don't know, I don't know!

32:07.310 --> 32:08.640
Brooks, I gotta get through.

32:08.725 --> 32:09.957
No one passes.

32:09.982 --> 32:11.234
I know one of the shop owners.

32:11.259 --> 32:12.279
He might need my help.

32:12.304 --> 32:14.944
If you got a friend back there,
there's nothing you can do to help.

32:15.006 --> 32:17.799
Now step back, Mr.
Terry, or I'll arrest you.

32:47.139 --> 32:48.772
Shawn!

32:50.609 --> 32:51.948
Get off me!

32:52.110 --> 32:53.110
There's my mom!

32:53.178 --> 32:54.110
Mom!

32:54.146 --> 32:56.045
Get off my son!

32:56.114 --> 32:58.047
Get off!

32:58.116 --> 32:59.749
That was my mom!

32:59.818 --> 33:01.773
Shawn!

33:06.031 --> 33:08.242
I told you both we didn't
want another Ferguson,

33:08.297 --> 33:10.542
but that's exactly what it's
starting to look like down there.

33:10.566 --> 33:12.065
I understand your concern, sir,

33:12.134 --> 33:13.378
but the race problems they've been having

33:13.402 --> 33:15.111
have been festering for decades.

33:15.158 --> 33:16.798
We didn't send you there
to dissect the race problem.

33:16.822 --> 33:18.337
We sent you down there
to dissect the events

33:18.361 --> 33:19.994
of the Jesse Carr shooting.

33:20.029 --> 33:21.295
Which you both said was linked

33:21.364 --> 33:22.689
to the Joey Campbell shooting.

33:23.042 --> 33:24.838
If we investigate why a fire started,

33:24.894 --> 33:26.993
we could say its 'cause
someone struck a match.

33:27.018 --> 33:29.120
But if we understand
why the match was lit,

33:29.166 --> 33:30.666
we get to the root cause.

33:30.870 --> 33:32.570
Isn't that what we do here?

33:32.632 --> 33:36.267
And what we don't do is make
things up as we go along.

33:36.637 --> 33:39.487
The sheriff informed me
that a Lieutenant Breeland

33:39.806 --> 33:42.747
found a witness who
contradicted your theories

33:42.748 --> 33:45.359
regarding a link between the
Carr and Campbell shooting.

33:45.803 --> 33:47.183
Is this true?

33:51.127 --> 33:54.028
Breeland's witness appears to...

33:55.539 --> 33:58.940
Breeland's witness appears
to contradict our findings.

34:00.755 --> 34:02.522
Preston is way too green.

34:02.955 --> 34:04.457
The governor asked for our assistance

34:04.492 --> 34:06.993
to prevent a city in her
state from being torn apart.

34:07.061 --> 34:09.629
Instead, this investigation
has caused more division,

34:09.697 --> 34:12.869
more distrust, and no
real tangible evidence.

34:13.244 --> 34:15.759
Ruiz is prepping a new team
to step in and take over.

34:15.837 --> 34:17.219
You both have a week to finish up.

34:30.809 --> 34:31.809
Javi?

34:31.833 --> 34:32.851
Hey.

34:38.804 --> 34:39.862
Ashe?

34:40.476 --> 34:41.670
Yeah.

35:03.328 --> 35:04.952
So now you got nothing to say?

35:06.898 --> 35:08.467
You called me, Ashe.

35:09.537 --> 35:10.968
How could you do that to me?

35:11.228 --> 35:13.095
It's not about you.

35:13.396 --> 35:14.771
It's about Kai.

35:15.098 --> 35:17.989
Look me in the face and
tell me she doesn't need me.

35:25.824 --> 35:27.043
You're reckless, Ashe.

35:27.068 --> 35:28.114
So are you!

35:28.282 --> 35:29.910
But I would never say that in court

35:29.958 --> 35:31.658
because I would never betray you.

35:33.884 --> 35:35.416
You really want me to go there?

35:35.485 --> 35:36.525
I didn't betray you, Javi.

35:36.586 --> 35:38.453
You screwed somebody else!

35:38.522 --> 35:39.788
I was scared about us

35:39.856 --> 35:41.835
and I did something really stupid.

35:41.860 --> 35:42.881
Come on!

35:43.202 --> 35:44.202
I know you,

35:45.006 --> 35:46.828
and scared is one thing
that you never were.

35:48.365 --> 35:49.898
I wouldn't be alive if that was true.

35:49.913 --> 35:51.163
I was too afraid to believe

35:51.188 --> 35:52.890
I deserved that kind of happiness.

35:53.273 --> 35:54.634
Don't do this to me, Ashe.

35:54.702 --> 35:56.669
I'm messed up, I know
that, but so are you.

35:57.116 --> 35:58.967
The things we've done,
the things we've seen,

35:58.992 --> 36:00.925
everything was always on volume ten.

36:00.994 --> 36:02.559
And then we had Kai

36:02.895 --> 36:05.799
and we tried to make it quiet,

36:06.033 --> 36:07.353
but we're not made for quiet.

36:07.392 --> 36:08.783
Quiet makes us think.

36:09.759 --> 36:11.703
I just had a gun pulled
on me the other day,

36:11.772 --> 36:13.850
and I got all this adrenaline
and no place to put it.

36:13.874 --> 36:15.542
You know what that's like.

36:15.784 --> 36:17.108
Why am I here?

36:17.177 --> 36:18.588
You're the only one who can handle me.

36:18.612 --> 36:20.212
And I'm the only one who can handle you.

36:21.148 --> 36:22.927
You're trying to be this other guy...

37:12.940 --> 37:14.218
Javi...

37:16.199 --> 37:18.245
I'm asking you, please

37:18.879 --> 37:20.562
drop this custody suit.

37:22.525 --> 37:24.310
This should have never happened, baby.

37:24.378 --> 37:25.543
That's not an answer.

37:30.865 --> 37:32.484
This was a mistake.

37:33.142 --> 37:34.754
I'm sorry, Ashe.

37:37.090 --> 37:38.824
I don't make mistakes.

37:42.475 --> 37:45.676
Ashe, I miss you.

37:46.066 --> 37:47.536
I miss you too.

37:49.480 --> 37:50.949
You recorded us?

37:56.287 --> 37:58.115
It's saved and safe.

37:59.190 --> 38:01.947
This whole thing, it was a setup?

38:04.205 --> 38:05.867
If you want to save your
relationship with Paula,

38:05.891 --> 38:06.991
you'll withdraw the case.

38:07.031 --> 38:08.271
We clear?

38:13.940 --> 38:15.870
The only thing that's clear to me now

38:17.119 --> 38:19.022
is you're unfit to be a mother.

38:34.181 --> 38:37.876
I saw that interview you gave
the first day you got to town.

38:38.962 --> 38:41.782
"My success will be an example to all

38:41.847 --> 38:45.127
that we must put our humanity first."

38:46.857 --> 38:49.353
You sounded like Abraham Lincoln.

38:49.973 --> 38:51.235
Thank you.

38:51.862 --> 38:55.103
Lincoln's Gettysburg Address
was riddled with lies.

38:56.259 --> 38:58.028
"Four score and seven years ago."

38:58.650 --> 39:00.485
Puts us back to the Declaration,

39:00.634 --> 39:01.966
not the Constitution.

39:02.034 --> 39:04.835
And "government of the people,
by the people, for the people"?

39:04.904 --> 39:06.303
What about the Southern people?

39:06.372 --> 39:08.005
Some might say that Lincoln

39:08.074 --> 39:10.063
invoked the principles of humanity

39:10.476 --> 39:11.947
and redefined the...

39:12.315 --> 39:14.502
Civil War as a struggle for...

39:14.940 --> 39:15.970
equality.

39:16.015 --> 39:18.179
Yeah, that's what Northerners say,

39:19.399 --> 39:20.608
but...

39:22.578 --> 39:23.895
The violence

39:23.956 --> 39:26.038
and the Department of Justice

39:26.173 --> 39:28.659
intrusion into our way of life

39:28.728 --> 39:32.162
is just a reminder that there's
just too much government.

39:32.231 --> 39:34.064
These uprisings are a
reminder of what happens

39:34.133 --> 39:35.881
when there's too little justice.

39:35.981 --> 39:39.207
Why don't we just agree

39:39.232 --> 39:40.479
to disagree?

39:41.036 --> 39:42.618
You worked pretty closely
with Sergeant Derkin

39:42.642 --> 39:43.832
on the Tours.

39:44.628 --> 39:47.239
Any theories as to why he
would have committed suicide?

39:49.682 --> 39:50.726
No.

39:51.751 --> 39:53.266
No, none at all.

39:54.594 --> 39:55.936
Well, here's mine.

39:56.947 --> 39:59.204
I think Derkin dishonored his badge

40:00.136 --> 40:02.523
and he thought he was no
longer worthy of wearing it

40:03.821 --> 40:06.430
because he was there the
night Joey Campbell was killed

40:07.150 --> 40:08.454
and he knew who did it.

40:08.479 --> 40:10.459
Wait a minute, are you saying

40:11.637 --> 40:14.604
you think that person is me?

40:14.774 --> 40:16.929
Before you have an opportunity
to badger my client...

40:16.961 --> 40:18.250
Just shut up.

40:18.312 --> 40:19.371
Was it you?

40:20.424 --> 40:23.575
No, it wasn't.

40:24.418 --> 40:26.917
And I think it would be a wise thing

40:26.952 --> 40:29.053
for you to spend some time

40:29.406 --> 40:31.922
pursuing the people who are responsible

40:31.991 --> 40:35.579
for this violence and this
destruction of property

40:35.995 --> 40:38.462
in the last 24 hours.

40:40.509 --> 40:41.965
That's exactly who I'm pursuing.

40:58.261 --> 40:59.598
Are you all right?

41:00.800 --> 41:02.119
They took my boy.

41:02.496 --> 41:03.981
Won't even let me see him.

41:05.251 --> 41:06.496
Let me help you.

41:07.327 --> 41:09.026
Ain't you done enough?

41:10.162 --> 41:12.196
You come down here and
throw it in our face

41:12.264 --> 41:15.766
that we don't matter...
Never have, never will.

41:16.856 --> 41:18.749
We ain't never gonna get justice.

41:19.355 --> 41:21.261
Can't even get it from ourselves.

41:34.171 --> 41:36.405
Shawn Campbell was arrested yesterday.

41:37.312 --> 41:38.407
He's a good kid.

41:39.272 --> 41:40.296
Yeah.

41:41.062 --> 41:42.595
I thought he was too,

41:42.664 --> 41:44.311
until he destroyed a police vehicle.

41:45.033 --> 41:46.499
His mother already lost one son.

41:46.568 --> 41:48.312
She doesn't deserve to lose another.

41:48.313 --> 41:49.509
So...

41:49.884 --> 41:52.839
you uphold the law until
you need to break it?

41:53.110 --> 41:54.344
If you respected the law,

41:54.369 --> 41:55.942
your town wouldn't be burning down.

41:56.458 --> 41:57.596
Are you implying I'm dirty?

41:57.621 --> 41:58.921
I don't know what you are.

41:59.984 --> 42:02.685
But I saw you save those
kids from being firehosed.

42:03.649 --> 42:04.948
So whatever you were,

42:05.017 --> 42:06.537
maybe you still want to be a good cop.

42:07.822 --> 42:09.459
I'm giving you that chance.

42:10.134 --> 42:11.456
One year on the job

42:11.523 --> 42:13.219
