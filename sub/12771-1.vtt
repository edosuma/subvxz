DAMN IT! UGH! A COUPLE WEEKS
AGO, WE WERE OUT FOR A WALK,

09:02.375 --> 09:05.000
AND LUCAS SAW A PLANE,
AND HE POINTED UP TO IT,

09:05.041 --> 09:07.625
AND PETE SAID, "LET'S GO.

09:07.667 --> 09:10.041
"WE CAN ALL FLY TO CENTRAL
AMERICA, THE THREE OF US.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.750
WE CAN STAY TOGETHER
AND HELP PEOPLE."

09:11.792 --> 09:13.625
I THOUGHT IT WAS A FANTASY.

09:13.667 --> 09:15.625
IT PROBABLY WAS!
NO, IT ISN'T,
BECAUSE RIGHT ABOUT NOW,

09:15.667 --> 09:18.041
PETE IS ENJOYING THE IN-FLIGHT
MOVIE ON HIS WAY TO EL SALVADOR.

09:18.083 --> 09:19.083
HE--HE GAVE UP. HE GAVE UP.

09:19.125 --> 09:21.041
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE WOULD DO THAT.

09:21.083 --> 09:22.834
THIS MORNING
HE SENT ME A TEXT.

09:22.875 --> 09:25.625
"WHATEVER HAPPENS,
KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU."

09:27.750 --> 09:29.625
WELL, PETE DID GROW UP
WITH A MOTHER IN JAIL.

09:29.667 --> 09:31.709
HE KNOWS FIRSTHAND
HOW HARD IT IS

09:31.750 --> 09:33.250
TO BE A KID
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BARS.

09:33.291 --> 09:36.709
SO YOU THINK HE'S PROTECTING
LUCAS. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

09:36.750 --> 09:38.709
PETE WAS LOOKING OUT FOR PETE.

09:38.750 --> 09:41.166
MY HUSBAND IS WEAK

09:41.208 --> 09:42.709
AND SELFISH AND A COWARD,

09:42.750 --> 09:45.000
AND I WILL NEVER FORGIVE HIM
FOR THIS.

HOW'D YOU SLEEP?

10:48.917 --> 10:50.375

11:24.083 --> 11:25.959
MM. SHE DOES HAVE A HUSBAND,

11:26.000 --> 11:28.417
WELL, HE'S AWAY ON BUSINESS,

HEY, MEGAN.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:41.083 --> 11:43.625
MY HUSBAND
MIGHT GO TO PRISON.

11:43.667 --> 11:45.542
(sighs) OKAY.

11:45.583 --> 11:47.041
I DON'T KNOW.

11:47.083 --> 11:49.125
I MEAN, I'M JUST--
HE'S...

11:49.166 --> 11:50.583
I DON'T KNOW.

11:50.625 --> 11:52.041
WHAT--WHAT DON'T YOU KNOW?

11:52.083 --> 11:54.333
I DON'T KNOW. (sighs)

11:54.375 --> 11:57.041
I DON'T--OKAY. HE...

11:57.083 --> 11:58.583
I DEFINITELY MADE
THE RIGHT CHOICE.

11:58.625 --> 12:00.792
HE MAKES ME VERY HAPPY.

12:00.834 --> 12:03.208
I AM REALLY, REALLY HAPPY.

12:03.250 --> 12:04.709
BUT?

12:04.750 --> 12:06.208
(sighs)

12:06.250 --> 12:07.500
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?

12:07.542 --> 12:08.625
T-TODAY?

12:08.667 --> 12:10.792
NO, I MEAN,
HAVE YOU LAID EYES ON HIM?

12:10.834 --> 12:13.375
HE'S A-ATTRACTIVE.
IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN?

12:13.417 --> 12:14.792
HE'S NOT "ATTRACTIVE."

12:14.834 --> 12:16.375
HE IS ZEUS.

12:16.417 --> 12:18.458
HE'S THOR.
HE'S BECKHAM.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.875
YOU'RE--YOU'RE MIXING UP YOUR
MYTHOLOGIES AND SOCCER PLAYERS.

12:20.917 --> 12:23.625
OKAY, HE'S FLYPAPER
AND WOMEN ARE THE FLIES.

12:23.667 --> 12:26.041
SAM IS NOT FLYPAPER?

12:26.083 --> 12:27.500
YEAH, BUT SAM DOESN'T SPEND
HIS DAYS

12:27.542 --> 12:30.375

12:30.417 --> 12:31.583

12:31.625 --> 12:32.667
OKAY.

12:32.709 --> 12:33.625
THANK YOU.

12:33.667 --> 12:35.417
(laughs) GOOD. GOOD.
OH, I'M VERY GLAD.

12:35.458 --> 12:39.041
I'M GLAD THAT MY HUMILIATING
INSECURITY IS GIVING YOU JOY.

12:39.083 --> 12:41.500
I MEAN, SAM'S PATIENTS ARE
WORRIED ABOUT THEIR HEARTS,

12:41.542 --> 12:42.834
DEREK'S ARE
GENERALLY BRAIN-DAMAGED,

12:42.875 --> 12:45.041
BUT JAKE'S ARE IN LOVE
WITH HIM

12:45.083 --> 12:46.625
BECAUSE HE CAN GIVE THEM
A GIFT

12:46.667 --> 12:49.208
THAT NOT EVEN THEIR OWN HUSBANDS
CAN GIVE THEM.

12:49.250 --> 12:51.917
THE MAN MAKES BABIES,

12:51.959 --> 12:55.291
AND HE'S KIND AND GENTLE
AND COMPASSIONATE,

12:55.333 --> 12:56.834
AND HE LOOKS LIKE THAT.

12:56.875 --> 12:59.041
(Violet laughs)
WHAT'S FUNNY?

12:59.083 --> 13:01.250
APPARENTLY, MY INNER WORKINGS.

13:01.291 --> 13:02.542
WELL, ARE YOU DONE?

13:02.583 --> 13:04.458
I NEED ADDISON.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.041

13:07.625 --> 13:09.750
DEBRA DIAMANTI, 39 WEEKS.

13:09.792 --> 13:11.542
CONTRACTIONS ARE REGULAR
AND FOUR MINUTES APART.

13:11.583 --> 13:14.959
OKAY, DEBRA. I'M DR. REILLY.
LET'S, UH, LET'S HAVE A LOOK.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.667
UH, WAIT. WHERE'S MY O.B.?
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET ME HERE.

13:16.709 --> 13:19.083
DR. MYER GOT HELD UP AT CEDARS,
DELIVERING ANOTHER BABY,

13:19.125 --> 13:21.875
SO YOU'RE IN LUCK.
YOU HAVE ME TODAY.
DON'T WORRY.

13:21.917 --> 13:23.583
I'M THE BEST LABOR AND DELIVERY
NURSE AT ST. AMBROSE.

13:23.625 --> 13:26.125
DR. REILLY'S JUST SOMEONE THEY
YELL AT WHEN THE PAIN GETS BAD.

13:26.166 --> 13:28.500
OKAY, I'M GONNA TAKE A LOOK.
ALL RIGHT?

13:28.542 --> 13:30.583
OKAY.

13:32.083 --> 13:34.291
OKAY, YOU'RE
AT ABOUT 5 CENTIMETERS.

13:34.333 --> 13:35.709
LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE
A LITTLE BIT OF TIME.

13:35.750 --> 13:39.041
OH. OH! OH!
THIS TOTALLY SUCKS.

13:39.083 --> 13:41.041
OOH, AND IT HURTS. OOH!

13:41.083 --> 13:43.125
OOH. MY BEST FRIEND, WHO WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE, IS IN CABO.

13:43.166 --> 13:46.000
BITCH. I TOLD HER NOT TO GO.

13:46.041 --> 13:47.417
DUE DATES AREN'T WRITTEN
IN STONE.

13:47.458 --> 13:49.917
BUT DID SHE LISTEN? NO.

13:49.959 --> 13:52.583
OHH. YOU KNOW SHE'S DRINKING
A MAI TAI, RIGHT?

13:52.625 --> 13:54.166
OR SCREWING SOME LIFEGUARD.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.750
OR CATCHING AN S.T.D.

13:55.792 --> 13:58.625
(laughs) IS THERE ANYONE ELSE
WE CAN CALL? ANY FAMILY?

13:58.667 --> 14:01.041
OH.

14:01.083 --> 14:02.125
NOPE.

14:02.166 --> 14:05.750
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

14:05.792 --> 14:07.166
ARE YOU OKAY?

14:07.208 --> 14:09.083
CAN YOU JUST GET ON
WITH IT?

14:09.125 --> 14:12.166
ALL RIGHT. TRY TO RELAX.
THIS SHOULDN'T TAKE LONG.

14:13.375 --> 14:16.583
(inhales and exhales deeply)

14:16.625 --> 14:18.458
(instruments rattle)

14:18.500 --> 14:20.041
(inhales deeply)

14:20.083 --> 14:21.750
THE LAST TIME
YOU POKED AROUND DOWN THERE

14:21.792 --> 14:23.333
WAS AFTER I WAS RAPED.

14:23.375 --> 14:25.667
IT'S WEIRD, UNCOMFORTABLE.

14:25.709 --> 14:29.041
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT SOMETHING?

14:29.083 --> 14:30.458
HOW'S HENRY?

14:30.500 --> 14:34.542
UH, WELL, JAKE SAID THAT
HE TOOK HIS FIRST FEW STEPS.

14:34.583 --> 14:36.041
OF COURSE,
I DON'T BELIEVE HIM.

14:36.083 --> 14:38.166
MM.
I MEAN, HE IS AN OVERACHIEVER
LIKE HIS MOTHER, BUT--

14:38.208 --> 14:39.208
STOP.

14:39.250 --> 14:41.625
DO YOU WANT ME TO STOP THE--

14:41.667 --> 14:44.917
TALKING. STOP TALKING
AND GET THIS OVER WITH.

14:46.917 --> 14:49.250
IF I'M STILL AT 5 CENTIMETERS,
I MIGHT HAVE TO KILL YOU.

14:49.291 --> 14:50.500
YOU'RE AT 7.

14:50.542 --> 14:51.625
WHERE THE HELL IS STEPHANIE?

14:51.667 --> 14:53.625
I PAGED HER.
I'M SURE SHE'S COMING.

14:53.667 --> 14:54.834
OOH.

14:54.875 --> 14:56.583
AS FOR THE PAIN,
THIS SHOULD HELP.

14:56.625 --> 14:58.208
NO--NO--NO NEEDLES.
NO, I HATE NEEDLES.

14:58.250 --> 14:59.583
WELL, MOST PEOPLE DO,

14:59.625 --> 15:02.291
BUT, DEBRA, THIS WILL LAST
FOR, LIKE, TWO SECONDS.

15:02.333 --> 15:04.041
THE PAIN OF LABOR COULD LAST
FOR ANOTHER COUPLE HOURS.

15:04.083 --> 15:06.417
NO, IT'S NOT ABOUT THE PAIN.
IT--THEY CONJURE AN IMAGE.

15:06.458 --> 15:08.500
IT'S A MEMORY.

15:08.542 --> 15:10.709
(sighs)

15:10.750 --> 15:14.041
MY DAD IS A DRUNK
AND A BASTARD,

15:14.083 --> 15:17.041
AND MY WHOLE CHILDHOOD
WAS SPENT IN THE E.R.,

15:17.083 --> 15:18.458
WAITING WHILE HE WOULD
GET TREATED FOR DEHYDRATION

15:18.500 --> 15:21.041
WITH I.V.s AND NEEDLES,

15:21.083 --> 15:23.542
AND I JUST CAN'T THINK
ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW.

15:23.583 --> 15:24.625
I CAN'T,

15:24.667 --> 15:27.709
'CAUSE I'M ABOUT
TO BE A MOTHER,

15:27.750 --> 15:29.500
(voice breaking) AND HE WAS
THE WORST FATHER IN THE WORLD,

15:29.542 --> 15:31.041
AND WHAT IF I'M LIKE HIM?

15:31.083 --> 15:33.041
ALL RIGHT. LISTEN TO ME.
LISTEN TO ME.
NO. (crying)

15:33.083 --> 15:35.041
LISTEN TO ME, OKAY?
ARE YOU LISTENING?

15:35.083 --> 15:36.834
YOU'LL BE A GREAT MOTHER.

15:36.875 --> 15:38.667
AND YOU WILL MAKE MISTAKES.
EVERY PARENT DOES.

15:38.709 --> 15:40.625
BUT YOU CAN DO THIS,
BECAUSE THIS RIGHT HERE,

15:40.667 --> 15:42.834
THIS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING
IN THE WHOLE WORLD,

15:42.875 --> 15:45.667
AND YES, THERE IS A LITTLE BIT
OF PAIN, BUT IT'S TEMPORARY.

15:45.709 --> 15:47.291
ALL RIGHT?
AND WHEN IT'S ALL OVER,

15:47.333 --> 15:49.625
I'M GONNA HAND YOU YOUR BABY,
AND YOU WILL EXPERIENCE

15:49.667 --> 15:52.667
A JOY THE LIKES OF WHICH
YOU'VE NEVER FELT.

15:52.709 --> 15:55.083
AND THAT'S WHY I DO THIS--
FOR THAT MOMENT, YOUR MOMENT.

15:55.125 --> 15:57.458
SO I NEED YOU TO TRUST ME,

15:57.500 --> 15:59.917
TO PUT YOUR FAITH IN ME
JUST A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.250
I WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

16:02.291 --> 16:03.542
OKAY?

16:03.583 --> 16:05.041
OKAY.

16:05.083 --> 16:06.625
GOOD.

16:08.083 --> 16:10.417
GO AHEAD
AND ROLL OVER ON YOUR SIDE.

16:11.750 --> 16:13.000
OKAY.

16:13.041 --> 16:14.291
OKAY.

16:14.333 --> 16:17.291
GOOD. CLOSE YOUR EYES. COUNT
TO 50 AS LOUD AS YOU WANT.

16:17.333 --> 16:18.542
YELL EVEN.

16:18.583 --> 16:21.583
OKAY. ONE. OH. TWO.

16:21.625 --> 16:25.041
THREE. FOUR...
THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY.

16:25.083 --> 16:27.041
FIVE, SIX...
SOMETHING'S HAPPENED
TO HER FATHER.

16:27.083 --> 16:28.333
ALL RIGHT.
DON'T TELL HER. NOT YET.

16:28.375 --> 16:29.959
SEVEN, EIGHT...

16:30.000 --> 16:31.709
PETE SHOULD'VE STAYED.
YOU STAY AND FIGHT.

16:31.750 --> 16:33.083
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

16:33.125 --> 16:35.041
YEAH, WELL, WHAT IF YOU CAN'T?
WHAT IF YOU'RE LOSING YOURSELF?

16:35.083 --> 16:37.917
I MEAN, ISN'T IT BETTER
TO JUST RUN FOR THE HILLS?

16:37.959 --> 16:40.875
ARE WE STILL TALKING
ABOUT PETE?

16:42.792 --> 16:44.500
I'M NOT ME.

16:44.542 --> 16:48.041
NEED A LITTLE HELP
FOLLOWING HERE.

16:48.083 --> 16:49.750
(sighs deeply)

16:49.792 --> 16:51.917
I GOT UP AT 5:00.

16:51.959 --> 16:53.542
I DO THAT
WHEN YOU STAY OVER.

16:53.583 --> 16:54.625
I AM NOT STUNNING
IN THE MORNING.

16:54.667 --> 16:56.375
I'M KIND OF A HOT MESS,

16:56.417 --> 16:58.166
BUT WHEN YOU SEE ME,
I'M ALL MADE UP,

16:58.208 --> 16:59.709
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I'M TRYING
TO BE ALL I CAN BE,

16:59.750 --> 17:01.458
BUT I'M FAILING MISERABLY

17:01.500 --> 17:04.250
BECAUSE--I JUST USED
AN ARMY SLOGAN TO MAKE MY POINT.

17:04.291 --> 17:06.000
FORGET IT. I-I-I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING.

17:06.041 --> 17:07.625
NO. NO. KEEP--KEEP TALKING.

17:07.667 --> 17:09.041
ONE OF US
WILL FIGURE IT OUT.

17:09.083 --> 17:11.792
I CHECK MY PHONE A LOT.

17:11.834 --> 17:13.583
I'M--I'M--I'M--I'M, LIKE,
WILLING IT TO BUZZ,

17:13.625 --> 17:15.583
BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE YOU,

17:15.625 --> 17:18.000
AND THEN WHEN IT IS YOU, I GET
THIS FEELING IN MY STOMACH.

17:18.041 --> 17:19.542
IT'S, LIKE, UM,
IT COULD BE BUTTERFLIES,

17:19.583 --> 17:21.458
BUT IT HURTS, LIKE, PAIN.

17:21.500 --> 17:24.041
I MEAN, ACTUAL PHYSICAL PAIN,

17:24.083 --> 17:27.250
LIKE--LIKE AN ULCER OR A TUMOR,
BUT IT'S NOT.

17:27.291 --> 17:28.458
IT'S YOU.

17:28.500 --> 17:30.542
DID YOU JUST REFER TO ME
AS CANCER?

17:30.583 --> 17:33.041
I CAN'T FOCUS,
I-I FORGET TO EAT,

17:33.083 --> 17:34.583
I'M INSECURE, I'M JEALOUS.

17:34.625 --> 17:36.792
I MEAN, I MORE CLOSELY RESEMBLE
MY 14-YEAR-OLD SELF

17:36.834 --> 17:39.041
THAN THE WOMAN I HAVE COME
TO RECOGNIZE AS ME,

17:39.083 --> 17:41.291
WHICH IS WHAT I MEANT

17:41.333 --> 17:44.291
WHEN I SAID I'M NOT ME,
AND...

17:44.333 --> 17:46.166
WHICH IS ALSO WHAT I MEANT
WHEN I,

17:46.208 --> 17:49.583
YES, MAYBE ACCIDENTALLY
REFERRED TO YOU AS...

17:49.625 --> 17:51.291
CANCER.

17:51.333 --> 17:55.625
OH, MY GOD. THIS CONVERSATION
WAS A BAD IDEA. I GOTTA GO.

17:57.500 --> 17:58.500
(door closes)

18:02.875 --> 18:05.875
♪♪♪

18:20.458 --> 18:22.417
UH, OKAY.

18:22.458 --> 18:26.500
I GOT ONE. UH, WHAT DID
THE ZERO SAY TO THE EIGHT?

18:26.542 --> 18:27.875
NICE BELT.

18:27.917 --> 18:29.333
(laughs)
THAT JOKE WASN'T FUNNY.

18:29.375 --> 18:30.333
MASON THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY.

18:30.375 --> 18:32.083
NO, DAD, I REALLY DIDN'T.

18:32.125 --> 18:33.667
(goofy voice) WHY ARE
YOU REALLY LAUGHING?

18:33.709 --> 18:35.250
(rumbling)
EARTHQUAKE!

18:35.291 --> 18:36.542
TRIANGLE OF LIFE!

18:36.583 --> 18:38.333
MASE, IT'S OVER ALREADY.

18:38.375 --> 18:40.625
TRIANGLE OF LIFE?
WHAT IS THAT?

18:40.667 --> 18:43.542
THEY DID A UNIT ON EARTHQUAKE
PREPAREDNESS LAST WEEK,

18:43.583 --> 18:45.500
AND WE NOW HAVE
ENOUGH BOTTLED WATER

18:45.542 --> 18:47.542
TO GET US THROUGH
THE APOCALYPSE.

18:47.583 --> 18:49.291
CLEAN WATER IS VERY IMPORTANT.

18:49.333 --> 18:51.667
SO IS GETTING TO SCHOOL ON TIME.
COME ON.

18:51.709 --> 18:53.792
(coughs)

18:55.333 --> 18:57.083
UH...

18:57.125 --> 19:00.542
I HAVE, UH, SOMETHING TO SAY,

19:00.583 --> 19:02.041
BUT DO NOT GET EXCITED.

19:02.083 --> 19:04.959
I WILL NOT GET EXCITED.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.500
WAIT. YOU'RE NOT SAYING
"DON'T FREAK OUT"?

19:07.542 --> 19:09.750
DOES THAT MEAN
IT'S A GOOD THING?

19:09.792 --> 19:11.000
YOU'RE PREGNANT?

19:12.750 --> 19:14.250
OH, MY GOD.

19:14.291 --> 19:16.542
OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD.
WAIT. ARE YOU PREGNANT?

19:16.583 --> 19:18.709
I SAID, DO NOT GET EXCITED.
OH. OH. OH. OKAY. OKAY.

19:18.750 --> 19:20.041
BUT YOU'RE PREGNANT?

19:20.083 --> 19:21.500
I HAVE AN I.U.D.

19:21.542 --> 19:23.041
I KNOW. I KNOW.
WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE, LIKE,

19:23.083 --> 19:26.000
A 1% CHANCE
OF GETTING PREGNANT,

19:26.041 --> 19:28.917
WHICH MEANS THAT IF YOU ARE,
MAYBE IT WAS MEANT TO BE?

19:28.959 --> 19:30.709
THE I.U.D. HAS TO BE REMOVED,

19:30.750 --> 19:32.750
AND WHEN IT IS, IT'S LIKELY
THAT I'LL MISCARRY.

19:32.792 --> 19:34.625
YOU MIGHT NOT.

19:34.667 --> 19:37.417
AND WE MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE--
A LITTLE BABY GIRL,

19:37.458 --> 19:39.125
A LITTLE TOWHEADED CHARLIE.

19:39.166 --> 19:40.542
WERE YOU EVER
A NATURAL BLONDE?

19:40.583 --> 19:42.834
I'M GONNA GO SEE ADDISON LATER.

19:42.875 --> 19:44.625
IN THE MEANTIME,
NOT A WORD TO ANYONE.

19:44.667 --> 19:46.959
PREGNANT.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.417
(sighs) NOT FOR LONG.

19:53.625 --> 19:56.458
(people speaking indistinctly)

19:56.500 --> 19:57.625
HI.

19:57.667 --> 19:58.875
(speaks indistinctly)

19:58.917 --> 20:00.583
SORRY I COULDN'T MAKE IT
THIS MORNING.

20:00.625 --> 20:02.208
(taps counter)
HOPE SHE SAVED ME SOME CAKE.

20:02.250 --> 20:03.375
SINCE WHEN DO YOU EAT CAKE?

20:03.417 --> 20:05.667
UGH. I'M GONNA KILL COOPER.

20:05.709 --> 20:07.709
THEY'RE FOR YOU.

20:09.417 --> 20:10.583
(laughs) WAIT. WAIT.

20:10.625 --> 20:12.667
WHY WOULD YOU
BE GETTING FLOWERS TODAY?

20:12.709 --> 20:14.583
DID I MISS SOMETHING OR...
(elevator bell dings)

20:15.792 --> 20:17.792
HOW FAR ALONG ARE YOU?

20:17.834 --> 20:19.333
A COUPLE MONTHS,
GIVE OR TAKE.

20:19.375 --> 20:21.583
THIS IS THE DOWNSIDE
OF YOUR KIND OF I.U.D.

20:21.625 --> 20:24.041
IS IRREGULAR PERIODS.

20:24.083 --> 20:25.500
THAT
AND AN UNPLANNED PREGNANCY.

20:25.542 --> 20:27.500
ANYWAY,
THIS SHOULD TAKE CARE OF IT.

20:27.542 --> 20:28.583
WELL, NOT NECESSARILY.

20:28.625 --> 20:30.834
I AM VERY GOOD AT MY JOB.

20:30.875 --> 20:34.000
WELL, NO NEED TO BE
AN OVERACHIEVER TODAY.

20:34.041 --> 20:36.458
WELL, IF I CAN'T HELP MYSELF

20:36.500 --> 20:38.458
FROM BEING THE BEST,

20:38.500 --> 20:40.792
YOU DO HAVE OPTIONS.

20:40.834 --> 20:42.041
NO, I DON'T.

20:42.083 --> 20:44.417
YOU KNOW, THERE'S
A COMMON MISCONCEPTION

20:44.458 --> 20:46.583
THAT BEING PRO-CHOICE
MEANS YOU RELISH THE OPPORTUNITY

20:46.625 --> 20:49.041
TO RUN INTO AN ALLEY
WITH A HANGER.

20:49.083 --> 20:50.500
I BELIEVE
IN A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE,

20:50.542 --> 20:52.083
BUT I DON'T HAVE THAT CHOICE.

20:52.125 --> 20:53.500
ALL RIGHT, WELL, GO AHEAD

20:53.542 --> 20:55.041
AND PUT YOUR FEET UP
IN THE STIRRUPS.

20:55.083 --> 20:58.291
YOU CAN LEAN BACK
AND USE THIS TO--
YEAH. I KNOW THE DRILL.

20:58.333 --> 20:59.625
I THOUGHT
YOU DIDN'T WANT KIDS.

20:59.667 --> 21:01.291
I DON'T.

21:01.333 --> 21:03.208
I GOT MASON,

21:03.250 --> 21:05.041
AND I LOVE HIM,

21:05.083 --> 21:07.625
BUT I DON'T WANT KIDS.

21:07.667 --> 21:10.041
THE ONLY THING IS I'M NOT 16
OR SINGLE

21:10.083 --> 21:13.083
OR WITHOUT MEANS.

21:13.125 --> 21:15.458
I CAN'T JUSTIFY.

21:15.500 --> 21:16.750
(inhales deeply)

21:16.792 --> 21:18.875
YOU NEED TO NOT BE GREAT
AT YOUR JOB TODAY

21:18.917 --> 21:21.041
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE OPTIONS.

21:21.083 --> 21:22.667
ARE YOU OKAY?

21:22.709 --> 21:26.041
CAN YOU JUST GET ON WITH IT?

21:26.083 --> 21:29.000
(people speaking indistinctly)

21:30.583 --> 21:32.458
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.041
I APPRECIATE YOU TRYING TO
MAKE ME FEEL BETTER, COOPER.

21:34.083 --> 21:35.542
AND NO ONE WANTS GOOD NEWS
MORE THAN ME.

21:35.583 --> 21:37.500
CHARLOTTE'S PREGNANT.
OH, MY GOD!

21:37.542 --> 21:39.041
THAT'S AMAZING.

21:39.083 --> 21:41.667
WOW. SHE'D KILL YOU
FOR TELLING ME.

21:41.709 --> 21:43.125
YOU KNOW, SHE HAS AN I.U.D.,
SO SHE DOESN'T THINK

21:43.166 --> 21:45.750
THE PREGNANCY'S
GONNA BE VIABLE, BUT, UM...

21:45.792 --> 21:47.458
SO WHY ARE YOU HAPPY?

21:47.500 --> 21:49.250
MY GUYS ARE CHAMPIONS.

21:49.291 --> 21:51.041
WHAT?

21:51.083 --> 21:54.500
MY SWIMMERS--THEY BEAT
THE BIG, BAD I.U.D., MAN.

21:54.542 --> 21:56.709
OH.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.166

24:25.291 --> 24:28.542

24:28.583 --> 24:33.041
ONE DAY AT A TIME, YOU CARRIED
ME THROUGH MY GRIEF,

24:33.083 --> 24:36.500
AND YOU CARRIED ME THROUGH
MY PREGNANCY AND MY...

24:40.083 --> 24:42.500
I STAYED SOBER THIS YEAR,

24:42.542 --> 24:44.250
FOR 365 DAYS,

24:50.875 --> 24:55.083
THESE STEPS, THESE ROOMS,
YOU PEOPLE...

24:55.125 --> 24:58.000
YOU CARRIED ME THROUGH.

(indistinct conversations)

25:03.792 --> 25:06.792
(rumbling)

25:06.834 --> 25:09.709

I'M NOT DELIRIOUS WITH JOY.

25:09.750 --> 25:11.500
(chuckles)
THAT WAS MAYBE BOTH.

25:11.542 --> 25:12.583
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.
(chuckles)

25:12.625 --> 25:13.542
(chuckles)

25:13.583 --> 25:16.166
YOU WANT SOME CAKE?

25:16.208 --> 25:18.208
UH, YES, BUT I HAVE
A PHYSICAL WITH SAM,

25:18.250 --> 25:20.166
AND IF MY SUGAR IS UP,
I HAVE TO LISTEN TO HIM

25:20.208 --> 25:21.959
AND HIS PERFECT FORM
LECTURE ME ABOUT IT,

25:22.000 --> 25:24.250
SO, I UM, I JUST--
I GOTTA RUN.

25:24.291 --> 25:25.375
YEAH.

25:25.417 --> 25:26.583
OKAY.

25:26.625 --> 25:28.000
BYE.

25:28.041 --> 25:31.542
(indistinct conversations
continue)

25:31.583 --> 25:32.625
HEY, ED.

25:32.667 --> 25:34.208
HEY, YOU.

25:35.583 --> 25:37.542
OH, DON'T LOOK AT ME
LIKE A DOCTOR.

25:37.583 --> 25:39.333
I CAN'T DRINK.
I CAN'T SMOKE.

25:39.375 --> 25:40.875
THE ONLY JOY I GET IS

25:40.917 --> 25:43.667
WHEN SOMEBODY HAS A BIRTHDAY
AROUND HERE, AND I CAN EAT CAKE.

25:43.709 --> 25:45.041
ED, I DON'T JUDGE.

25:45.083 --> 25:48.125
HEY. WHEN IS YOUR APPOINTMENT
WITH DR. TURNER?

25:48.166 --> 25:50.625
(mouth full) WHAT APPOINTMENT?

25:52.458 --> 25:53.500
I'M SCARED.

25:55.208 --> 25:57.291
I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THIS.

25:59.083 --> 26:00.583
IT'S TOO LATE, AMELIA.

26:00.625 --> 26:03.041
NO.

26:03.083 --> 26:06.083
FOR RYAN, FOR MY BABY,

26:06.125 --> 26:07.834
IT'S TOO LATE.

26:07.875 --> 26:09.709
WE'RE STILL HERE, ED.

26:11.667 --> 26:14.500
I WANT IT NOTED FOR THE RECORD
THAT I RESISTED CAKE TODAY.

26:14.542 --> 26:17.083
WELL, I DIDN'T SAY "NEVER."
I JUST SAID "IN MODERATION."

26:17.125 --> 26:19.667
YEAH, I'M TOO OLD TO MODERATE.
IT'S ALL OR NOTHING.

26:19.709 --> 26:22.291
I SPENT THE WEEKEND IN CHICAGO
EATING SKINLESS CHICKEN BREAST.

26:22.333 --> 26:23.583
I-I WAS MISERABLE,

26:23.625 --> 26:26.041
EXCEPT FOR THE COMPANY.
IT WAS...

26:26.083 --> 26:27.709
BREATHE IN.

26:27.750 --> 26:28.667
(inhales and exhales deeply)

26:28.709 --> 26:30.208
AH, THE EX.

26:30.250 --> 26:31.709
DOES SHE HAVE A NAME?

26:31.750 --> 26:33.834
BECAUSE I THINK
IF YOU'RE SEEING YOUR EX,

26:33.875 --> 26:35.333
SHE'S NOT REALLY YOUR EX.

26:35.375 --> 26:36.542
LAURA.

26:36.583 --> 26:39.291
LAURA. WELL, YOU MUST BE
PRETTY HAPPY WITH LAURA

26:39.333 --> 26:41.542
'CAUSE YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE'S
NEVER BEEN THIS LOW.

26:41.583 --> 26:43.041
YEAH, WELL, I WISH
I COULD SEE HER MORE.

26:43.083 --> 26:44.750
I MEAN, I SEE HER.

26:44.792 --> 26:47.041
WE MEET IN A NEW
AND EXCITING CITY EVERY MONTH.

26:47.083 --> 26:48.917
WE HAVE THREE MARVELOUS DAYS
AT THE FOUR SEASONS

26:48.959 --> 26:51.041
AND GO BACK TO OUR LIVES,

26:51.083 --> 26:53.041
AND IT WORKS. THERE'S NO FEAR
OF FAILURE THIS WAY.

26:53.083 --> 26:55.041
THERE'S NOTHING TO FIGHT ABOUT.
WE DON'T GET SICK OF EACH OTHER.

26:55.083 --> 26:57.542
IT'S, YOU KNOW, IT'S...
IT'S PERFECT.

26:57.583 --> 26:59.208
EXCEPT YOU WISH
YOU COULD SEE HER MORE.

26:59.250 --> 27:01.917
WELL, IF I DID,
IT MIGHT NOT WORK.

27:01.959 --> 27:03.792
IF YOU DON'T TRY FOR REAL,
YOU CAN'T KNOW.

27:03.834 --> 27:05.542
WE DID TRY FOR REAL.

27:05.583 --> 27:07.917
WE WERE MARRIED
AND SUBSEQUENTLY DIVORCED.

27:07.959 --> 27:13.000
AND THE IDEA OF TWO STRIKES
GIVES ME PAUSE.

27:16.291 --> 27:19.041
LOOK, SAM, I'M SORRY. I-I DON'T
WANT TO BUG YOU ABOUT ADDISON.

27:19.083 --> 27:20.333
BUT A--

27:20.375 --> 27:21.959
ARE YOU OKAY?

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
THEY'RE FOR YOU.

27:24.041 --> 27:25.875
(laughs)

27:25.917 --> 27:27.500
WAIT. WAIT. WHY WOULD YOU BE
GETTING FLOWERS TODAY?

27:27.542 --> 27:30.041
DID I MISS SOMETHING OR...

27:30.083 --> 27:31.166
WHO ARE THEY FROM?

27:31.208 --> 27:33.750
OH, MY EX LAURA.
I SHOULD HAVE HER MOVE HERE.

27:33.792 --> 27:36.041
YOU KNOW, MAYBE IT COULD WORK
THIS TIME.
WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME?

27:36.083 --> 27:39.041
WELL, I WANTED CHILDREN,
AND SHE DIDN'T AND...

27:39.083 --> 27:40.625
YOU DON'T WANT 'EM ANYMORE?

27:40.667 --> 27:42.041
WELL, WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG,

27:42.083 --> 27:43.792
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS
YOU THINK ARE DEAL BREAKERS

27:43.834 --> 27:46.291
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW ELUSIVE LOVE IS,

27:46.333 --> 27:49.750
BUT LATER, WHAT YOU WANT--
WELL, IT CHANGES.
(elevator bell dings)

27:49.792 --> 27:51.959
NOT ALWAYS.

27:53.625 --> 27:56.000
STOPPING TO SMELL THE ROSES?

28:00.417 --> 28:01.583
(knock on door)

28:01.625 --> 28:03.375
DID YOU HEAR?

28:03.417 --> 28:04.583
I DON'T BUY IT.

28:04.625 --> 28:06.041
PETE DIDN'T RUN.

28:06.083 --> 28:07.583
PETE DOESN'T RUN
FROM THE TOUGH STUFF.

28:07.625 --> 28:10.083
I MEAN,
HE RISKED HIS MEDICAL LICENSE,

28:10.125 --> 28:13.125
HIS FREEDOM, AND HIS FAMILY
TO HELP TROY FIND PEACE.

28:13.166 --> 28:15.250
AND--AND TROY WASN'T
THE ONLY ONE HE DID IT FOR.

28:15.291 --> 28:17.792
WHEN MY FRIEND MICHELLE
DIDN'T WANT TO END HER DAYS

28:17.834 --> 28:19.208
TWITCHING AND INCOHERENT
FROM HUNTINGTON'S,

28:19.250 --> 28:21.041
I DIDN'T HAVE THAT STRENGTH.

28:21.083 --> 28:24.542
I RAN. I ESCAPED. I-I...
I COULDN'T GET HIGH FAST ENOUGH.

28:24.583 --> 28:26.125
WELL, AMELIA, W--

28:26.166 --> 28:28.542
WELL, PART OF YOUR RECOVERY IS
ABOUT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY

28:28.583 --> 28:30.208
FOR YOUR FAILURES.

28:30.250 --> 28:32.625
THIS LAST YEAR, YOU'VE SHOWN
TREMENDOUS STRENGTH.

28:32.667 --> 28:35.625
TREMENDOUS. AND I WON'T LET YOU
UNDERVALUE YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS

28:35.667 --> 28:37.417
AND THE PRIDE YOU SHOULD FEEL.

28:37.458 --> 28:38.667
NO, NOT EVER,

28:38.709 --> 28:39.583
BUT ESPECIALLY NOT TODAY.

28:39.625 --> 28:42.917
I MEAN,
WHY WOULD YOU GO THERE?

28:45.625 --> 28:49.500
YOU NEED TO LIVE
A VERY, VERY LONG TIME.

28:51.125 --> 28:54.041
I NEVER WOULD'VE MADE IT HERE.

28:54.083 --> 28:56.291
AND IT IS GONNA TAKE
THE REST OF MY LIFE

28:56.333 --> 28:58.625
FOR ME
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU, SO...

28:58.667 --> 29:01.166
YOU NEED TO LIVE A LONG TIME.

29:05.291 --> 29:07.834
(Sheldon) VIOLET?

29:07.875 --> 29:10.667
SHELDON,
I'M GLAD I FOUND YOU.

29:10.709 --> 29:13.250
OH, DID WE HAVE PLANS?
NO, I HAVE YOUR BLOOD RESULTS.

29:13.291 --> 29:15.750
DON'T TELL ME MY CHOLESTEROL
IS BACK UP AGAIN.

29:15.792 --> 29:17.333
I'VE BEEN DOING EVERYTHING
YOU TOLD ME TO.

29:17.375 --> 29:20.917
IT'S NOT THAT. IT'S NOT THAT.
JUST COME WITH ME TO MY OFFICE.

29:28.917 --> 29:31.959
♪♪♪

29:44.083 --> 29:46.041

29:46.083 --> 29:47.709

29:49.959 --> 29:52.458
MM.

29:52.500 --> 29:54.041
HEY.

29:54.083 --> 29:55.250
MM.

29:55.291 --> 29:56.750
(rumbling)

29:56.792 --> 29:58.000
(clatters)

29:58.041 --> 29:59.709
(laughs)
HA HA.

29:59.750 --> 30:01.041
WE HAVE AN EARTHQUAKE,

30:01.083 --> 30:02.875
AND THE FIRST THING
YOU GRAB IS THE JUICE.

30:02.917 --> 30:05.333
I WAS TRYING TO SAVE
THE PANCAKES FROM THE JUICE.

30:05.375 --> 30:06.375
OKAY.

30:06.417 --> 30:08.000
MM.

30:08.041 --> 30:11.041
I WASN'T SURE HOW I WAS GONNA BE
FIRST NIGHT AT YOUR PLACE.

30:11.083 --> 30:13.458
I USUALLY TOSS AND TURN
AND STARE AT THE CEILING.

30:13.500 --> 30:14.458
YOU LOOKED SO PEACEFUL.

30:14.500 --> 30:16.000
YOU HAVE
A REALLY GOOD MATTRESS.

30:17.542 --> 30:19.500
AND IT WAS
A REALLY GOOD NIGHT.

30:27.083 --> 30:29.208
LOOK, SAM, I'M SORRY. I DON'T
WANT TO BUG YOU ABOUT ADDISON.

30:29.250 --> 30:30.500
BUT A-ARE YOU OKAY?

30:30.542 --> 30:32.792
I'M FINE. YEAH.

30:32.834 --> 30:33.917
ALL RIGHT.

30:33.959 --> 30:36.417
SAM.
I'M FINE. I'M FINE.

30:36.458 --> 30:37.625
WELL, IT SUCKS WHEN YOU'RE
NOT THE ONE THEY CHOOSE.

30:37.667 --> 30:39.041
WELL, SOMETIMES YOU'RE...

30:39.083 --> 30:40.709
A LITTLE TOO LATE.

30:40.750 --> 30:43.959
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE WE WEREN'T
MEANT TO BE TOGETHER.

30:44.000 --> 30:45.291
EITHER YOU'RE A VERY GOOD LIAR,

30:45.333 --> 30:48.083
OR PSYCHOLOGICALLY,
YOU'RE VERY HEALTHY.

30:48.125 --> 30:51.041
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE WE BOTH
GOT OUR CHECKUPS TODAY.

30:51.083 --> 30:52.166
ALL RIGHT. HOP DOWN.

30:52.208 --> 30:53.375
(sighs)

30:53.417 --> 30:54.750
LET'S GO.

30:59.083 --> 31:01.709
PERHAPS A DOCTOR
WITH SMALLER HANDS...

31:01.750 --> 31:02.834
(grunts)

31:02.875 --> 31:05.625
HEY. GOOD LUCK TODAY.

31:05.667 --> 31:07.208
MM-HMM. MM-HMM. MM-HMM.

31:07.250 --> 31:09.542
WHAT?
(Cooper) OH, COME ON, SAM.

31:09.583 --> 31:12.041
COULD YOU JUST ADMIT IT?
WE ALL KNOW. EVERYONE KNOWS.

31:12.083 --> 31:14.542
YOU ALL KNOW WHAT?
(Charlotte) IF HE DOESN'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT--

31:14.583 --> 31:16.041
WE TALK ABOUT
EVERYTHING HERE.

31:16.083 --> 31:18.959
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T.
I GOTTA GO. I'M ON CALL.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.041
SAM, EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT
YOU AND STEPHANIE.

31:21.083 --> 31:22.625
I DON'T KNOW.
WHO--WHO'S STEPHANIE?

31:22.667 --> 31:23.959
A LABOR AND DELIVERY NURSE.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.041
SHE'S GREAT.
STOLE HER FROM U.C.L.A.

31:27.083 --> 31:29.625
(Cooper) COME ON.
JUST NOD YOUR HEAD.

31:29.667 --> 31:32.041
HAVE YOU SEEN A CAR
IN HIS DRIVEWAY?

31:32.083 --> 31:34.041
WHAT AM I, NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH?
THIS IS NONE OF OUR BUSINESS.

31:34.083 --> 31:37.041
C--I JUST--I NEED
A LITTLE VICARIOUS THRILL, OKAY?

31:37.083 --> 31:38.709
ESPECIALLY NOW.
COOPER.

31:38.750 --> 31:39.625
(whispers) SORRY.

31:39.667 --> 31:41.041
(normal voice) WOULD YOU
DENY ME THAT?

31:41.083 --> 31:43.917
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE BEING A BABY.

31:43.959 --> 31:46.583
I AM THE ONLY ADULT
AT THIS TABLE RIGHT NOW.

31:46.625 --> 31:48.792
I'M AN ADULT.
I'M PERPETUALLY IN THE DARK,

31:48.834 --> 31:51.750
BUT I'M VERY MUCH AN ADULT.

31:53.333 --> 31:55.417
HEY.
CAN I...

31:55.458 --> 31:57.000
SURE. SURE. WHAT'S UP?

31:58.834 --> 32:01.291
I'M SORRY...

32:01.333 --> 32:02.625
ABOUT EARLIER WITH COOPER.

32:02.667 --> 32:05.709
IF YOU'RE TRYING
TO KEEP YOUR LIFE PRIVATE

32:05.750 --> 32:07.667
OUT OF RESPECT FOR ME, YOU KNOW,
YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THAT.

32:07.709 --> 32:09.041
OH, NO, ADDISON.

32:09.083 --> 32:11.625
UM, I PROPOSED, YOU SAID NO,

32:11.667 --> 32:14.959
AND YOU WERE RIGHT.
I MEAN, WHAT DID YOU CALL IT?

32:15.000 --> 32:16.333
MY HAIL MARY PASS?

32:16.375 --> 32:18.500
NO, MY--MY TIMING WAS OFF.

32:18.542 --> 32:20.083
OR OUR TIMING.

32:20.125 --> 32:23.041
WHATEVER.

32:23.083 --> 32:24.500
BUT I'M FINE.

32:24.542 --> 32:27.041
YOU SURE?

32:27.083 --> 32:29.959
BECAUSE ALL--ALL I WANT IS
FOR YOU TO BE HAPPY.

32:31.166 --> 32:33.000
I AM HAPPY.

32:34.917 --> 32:36.375
REALLY.

32:36.417 --> 32:39.458
(Sam) I MEAN, I DON'T WANT PETE
TO HAVE TO SERVE TIME.

32:39.500 --> 32:41.917
I REALLY DON'T, BUT, YOU KNOW,
HE DID END A MAN'S LIFE.

32:41.959 --> 32:43.750
BUT STILL, YOU CAN SEE
WHY HE DID IT.

32:43.792 --> 32:45.667
YES. BUT HE RISKED TOO MUCH.
ALL RIGHT?

32:45.709 --> 32:48.125
THE MAN'S GOT A WIFE,
HE'S GOT A LITTLE KID, AND--

32:48.166 --> 32:50.500
IT'S EASIER TO TAKE CHANCES
WHEN YOU'RE SINGLE.

32:50.542 --> 32:52.750
SO IT SUCKS YOU MET ME, HUH?

32:52.792 --> 32:55.583
OH, ABOUT THAT. UH...

32:55.625 --> 32:57.875
I THINK THAT
WE HAVE BEEN OUTED.

32:57.917 --> 33:00.542
GOOD. WHEN A GUY DOESN'T
TELL HIS FRIENDS,

33:00.583 --> 33:03.333
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU STAND.

33:03.375 --> 33:06.041
OH, I'M SORRY. I DID--

33:06.083 --> 33:07.291
I LIKE YOU.

33:07.333 --> 33:09.041
I LIKE YOU A LOT.

33:09.083 --> 33:11.583
ALL RIGHT, THE ONLY REASON...

33:11.625 --> 33:13.000
DOCTORS AT THE PRACTICE--

33:13.041 --> 33:14.500
WE'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT
EVERYTHING,

33:14.542 --> 33:16.500
AND I GUESS--

33:16.542 --> 33:20.291
I DON'T KNOW, I GUESS I JUST--
I DON'T WANNA SHARE YOU.

33:20.333 --> 33:23.875
WELL, IF WE ARE OUTED,
I CAN DO THIS NOW.

33:27.625 --> 33:29.041
ALL RIGHT.
(pager beeps)

33:29.083 --> 33:30.208
(laughs)

33:30.250 --> 33:31.709
(beeping stops)

33:31.750 --> 33:33.709
EXCUSE ME, SIR?

33:33.750 --> 33:35.000
ME?

33:35.041 --> 33:36.041
YES, SIR.
WHAT'S--WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

33:36.083 --> 33:37.291
(slurring) ED.

33:37.333 --> 33:38.709
OKAY, ED, ARE YOU
FEELING ALL RIGHT?

33:38.750 --> 33:42.000
YEAH, I'M FINE. I'M HERE
TO SEE MY DAUGHTER DEBRA.

33:42.041 --> 33:43.959
SHE'S HAVING A BABY.
OKAY, YOU DON'T--
YOU DON'T LOOK WELL.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.333
UH, ED, DO YOU MIND
IF I CHECK YOU OUT?

33:46.375 --> 33:48.875
NO, I DON'T HAVE TIME.
I NEED TO FIND MY KID.

33:48.917 --> 33:50.667
SEE, I GOTTA TELL HER
WHAT A NICE--UHH!

33:50.709 --> 33:52.041
OH!
WHOA. WHOA.

33:52.083 --> 33:53.750
WHOA. OKAY.

33:53.792 --> 33:56.208
(grunts)
OKAY. EASY.

33:56.250 --> 33:57.458
(grunts)

33:58.917 --> 34:00.417
I'M GONNA NEED A--

34:00.458 --> 34:01.667
CRASH CART!
YEAH.

34:01.709 --> 34:02.667
GOT IT!
WE NEED SOME HELP OVER HERE!

34:02.709 --> 34:03.959
ALL RIGHT. HOLD ON.

34:07.917 --> 34:10.041
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

34:10.083 --> 34:12.208
I HAVE TO SEE MY DAUGHTER.

34:12.250 --> 34:14.583
WELL, YOU JUST HAD
A CARDIAC EVENT.

34:14.625 --> 34:16.291
IS THAT
WHAT THEY CALL IT NOW?

34:16.333 --> 34:19.041
IT SOUNDS LIKE
A BAR MITZVAH.

34:19.083 --> 34:22.583
THAT'S NOT FUNNY. I'VE GOT TO
UNCLOG YOUR CORONARY ARTERY,

34:22.625 --> 34:24.875
THEN MONITOR
YOUR HEART FUNCTION,

34:24.917 --> 34:28.500
THEN YOU HAVE TO REST,
THEN MAYBE YOU CAN SEE HER.

34:28.542 --> 34:30.875
I'M NOT GONNA DIE.

34:30.917 --> 34:32.041
I MEAN, EVENTUALLY, SURE,

34:32.083 --> 34:35.458
BUT LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING,
DOC.

34:35.500 --> 34:38.041
THIS CARDIAC EVENT OF MINE--

34:38.083 --> 34:42.208
IF I WAS TAKING A SHOWER
OR WATCHING TV,

34:42.250 --> 34:44.458
PLAYING POKER AT THE COMMERCE,

34:44.500 --> 34:46.375
I'D BE DEAD NOW, RIGHT?

34:46.417 --> 34:48.375
YEAH.

34:48.417 --> 34:51.750
(beeping continues)

34:51.792 --> 34:56.834
I NEVER BELIEVED
IN A HIGHER POWER BEFORE TODAY.

34:56.875 --> 35:01.709
BUT TODAY, I WAS VISITED
BY HIS EMISSARIES.

35:01.750 --> 35:04.458
I DIDN'T WANT TO GO
TO MY MEETING THIS MORNING,

35:04.500 --> 35:07.083
BUT THEY WERE USING JACKHAMMERS
OUTSIDE OF MY HOUSE,

35:07.125 --> 35:08.625
AND I COULDN'T SLEEP.

35:08.667 --> 35:13.834
THEN THIS SWEET KID AT A.A.
GAVE THIS NICE LITTLE SPEECH.

35:13.875 --> 35:15.875
GAVE ME A KICK IN MY BEHIND.

35:15.917 --> 35:20.041
AND THIS SHRINK
MADE ME REALIZE,

35:20.083 --> 35:24.041
I COULDN'T MOVE ON
UNTIL I MADE THINGS RIGHT,

35:24.083 --> 35:27.709
AND I CAME TO SEE MY DAUGHTER.

35:27.750 --> 35:30.000
THEN I RAN INTO YOU...

35:33.000 --> 35:35.375
A HEART GUY
ON A MATERNITY WARD,

35:35.417 --> 35:40.333
BECAUSE YOU WERE FLIRTING
WITH A PRETTY NURSE.

35:41.709 --> 35:45.583
I HAD A CARDIAC EVENT
IN FRONT OF YOU,

35:45.625 --> 35:48.542
AND THAT'S WHY I LIVED.

35:50.166 --> 35:52.041
DO YOU BELIEVE
IN A HIGHER POWER?

35:52.083 --> 35:54.542
I BELIEVE IN GOD.

35:56.750 --> 36:00.625
HE ALL BUT CAME DOWN
AND TOLD US,

36:00.667 --> 36:03.041
IT'S NOT MY TIME.

36:03.083 --> 36:05.041
NOT YET.

36:05.083 --> 36:08.834
I HAVE SOMETHING LEFT TO DO

36:08.875 --> 36:10.542
AND I NEED TO DO IT.

36:17.625 --> 36:20.750
(indistinct conversations)

36:24.542 --> 36:27.041
HEY. SO...

36:27.083 --> 36:29.000
WE'RE OKAY, YOU AND ME.

36:29.041 --> 36:31.834
YOU SAID WE WERE OKAY
TWO MONTHS AGO.

36:31.875 --> 36:33.959
YEAH, I WAS LYING.
I LIED... TWO MONTHS AGO.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.208
BUT NOW--
NOW WE'RE REALLY OKAY.

36:37.250 --> 36:39.041
OKAY.

36:39.083 --> 36:40.125
GOOD.

36:40.166 --> 36:41.583
ALL RIGHT.

36:41.625 --> 36:44.625
(indistinct conversations
continue)

36:46.458 --> 36:47.625
(knock on door)

36:49.500 --> 36:52.041
HI. (exhales)
