11:09.843 --> 11:11.540

11:11.583 --> 11:13.760
so can't you just
arrest those guys?

11:13.803 --> 11:16.153
- The case is a little more
complicated than that.

11:16.197 --> 11:18.286
- Willa, you didn't get
a rape kit.

11:18.329 --> 11:19.766
You didn't report right away.

11:19.809 --> 11:22.290
- And none of that means
you weren't assaulted,

11:22.333 --> 11:25.510
but these boys are gonna lawyer
up as soon as we question them.

11:25.554 --> 11:28.296
- Which is why we want you
to talk to them first,

11:28.339 --> 11:31.647
while we listen in.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.345
- Well, Diggy's the only one
who wants to talk to me.

11:34.389 --> 11:36.173
- Diggy Wheeler?
How do you know that?

11:36.217 --> 11:38.219

11:38.262 --> 11:41.701

he wants to apologize.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.792

text him back then?

11:47.837 --> 11:50.492

there's no news on Rita Lasku.

11:50.535 --> 11:52.755

where she worked claimed

11:52.799 --> 11:54.409

21:36.382 --> 21:38.732
- Captain Benson,
in your experience,

21:38.775 --> 21:41.822
is it unusual for a victim to
come forward on social media?

21:41.865 --> 21:43.476
- Actually, no.

21:43.519 --> 21:48.002
Public online disclosures are
becoming more and more common.

21:48.045 --> 21:50.396
Many survivors like to disclose

21:50.439 --> 21:52.093
within their social media
networks,

21:52.136 --> 21:56.358
because it gives them
an enhanced sense of control.

21:56.402 --> 21:59.361
And, in Willa Bartola's case,
that was TikTok.

21:59.405 --> 22:01.363

22:01.407 --> 22:03.496
the video minutes
after the assault,

22:03.539 --> 22:05.498
Willa didn't post it
until a week later.

22:05.541 --> 22:07.935
- And that's
not unusual either.

22:07.978 --> 22:09.763
Willa was traumatized.

22:09.806 --> 22:12.896
She was trying to stay in
the good graces of her rapist.

22:12.940 --> 22:16.335
Victims can take far longer
to come forward.

22:16.378 --> 22:18.989

Even--even years.

22:19.033 --> 22:21.427
- Thank you, Captain.

22:21.470 --> 22:23.429
- So she waited a week.

22:23.472 --> 22:27.955
Maybe that's not unusual,
but it does happen to coincide

22:27.998 --> 22:29.260
with the day that she learned

22:29.304 --> 22:31.872
that she wasn't invited
to join the house.

22:31.915 --> 22:34.527
Doesn't that give her
another motive?

22:34.570 --> 22:37.834
- In my experience
as an SVU captain,

22:37.878 --> 22:40.271
I believe that she was
reacting to her assault.

22:40.315 --> 22:41.751
- But you're positive

22:41.795 --> 22:43.927
that she wasn't reacting
in anger to being rejected?

22:43.971 --> 22:45.494
- Objection.
- Overruled.

22:45.538 --> 22:47.235
The witness may answer.

22:47.278 --> 22:50.847
- There are many reasons why
a survivor delays reporting.

22:50.891 --> 22:52.414
- Including trying to
get more followers?

22:52.458 --> 22:54.329
- I don't think that was
the case here.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.113
- But you can't know that
for sure.

23:02.119 --> 23:03.425

Found her in a bathroom.

Crying.

23:13.827 --> 23:15.437
- And what did she tell
you had happened?

23:15.481 --> 23:17.439
- That Tate and Liam
trapped her in a bedroom

23:17.483 --> 23:19.093
and assaulted her.

23:19.136 --> 23:20.964
I told her that
we should get a rape kit.

23:21.008 --> 23:22.139

23:22.183 --> 23:24.446
- She was having
a panic attack.

23:38.547 --> 23:41.463
- Did you see Tate and Liam
do anything to Willa?

23:41.507 --> 23:43.813
- I wasn't in the bedroom.
No.

28:47.073 --> 28:49.640
about the use of social media
in this case.

28:49.684 --> 28:52.687
But then I thought,
"Maybe I imagined it."

28:52.731 --> 28:54.994
- Your Honor, we had no
prior knowledge to this tape.

28:55.037 --> 28:56.822
And, although
we have listed Mr. Wheeler

28:56.865 --> 28:57.953
as a defense witness,

28:57.997 --> 29:00.216
obviously that is
no longer the case.

29:00.260 --> 29:02.262
- Mr. Wheeler?
- I'm sorry.

29:02.305 --> 29:03.872
My fans were barraging me
with questions.

29:03.916 --> 29:05.004
I owed them an answer.

29:05.047 --> 29:06.657
But I deleted the video,
Your Honor.

29:06.701 --> 29:07.963
- As if that helps.

29:08.007 --> 29:09.704
Given that there's no way
to ensure the jury

29:09.748 --> 29:11.967
hasn't seen the video,
we move for a mistrial.

29:12.011 --> 29:14.404
- The jury has seen
far worse, Your Honor.

29:14.448 --> 29:16.798
And now that the defense
is no longer interested

29:16.842 --> 29:18.321
in Mr. Wheeler's testimony,

29:18.365 --> 29:20.889
I'll be calling him as
a witness for the prosecution.

29:20.933 --> 29:23.109
- Your Honor, this is the first
I'm hearing of this.

29:23.152 --> 29:24.937
My client has not agreed
to testify.

29:24.980 --> 29:26.155
- I'm prepared to compel him.

29:26.199 --> 29:27.853
- Mr. Wheeler's
shifting testimony

29:27.896 --> 29:30.029
is inherently unreliable,
and he obviously has

29:30.072 --> 29:31.813
an axe to grind
with his now former housemates.

29:31.857 --> 29:35.382
- You'll have your opportunity
to cross-examine, Mr. Swope.

29:35.425 --> 29:38.820
I'm denying defense's motion
for a mistrial.

29:38.864 --> 29:41.910
Mr. Carisi,
call your next witness.

<i>- No means no.
There's no excuse.</i>

29:47.437 --> 29:49.091
<i>Willa, stay strong.</i>

29:49.135 --> 29:51.790
<i>I hope someday you'll find it
in your heart to forgive me.</i>

29:51.833 --> 29:54.662
- Mr. Wheeler,
why did you make that video?

29:54.705 --> 29:56.272
- Because I believe
Willa was sexually assaulted

29:56.316 --> 29:58.100
by Tate and Liam.
- Objection.

29:58.144 --> 29:59.798
- Sustained.

29:59.841 --> 30:02.322
- Mr. Wheeler, you were
originally supposed to be

30:02.365 --> 30:04.063
a witness for the defense.

30:04.106 --> 30:06.805
Can you explain why you're now
testifying for the prosecution?

30:06.848 --> 30:10.286
- Yes, I saw Willa
after she was cross-examined.

30:10.330 --> 30:14.116
She was shaking, raw, hurt.

30:14.160 --> 30:15.335
I have a lot of experience

30:15.378 --> 30:16.989
auditioning performers
for my house,

30:17.032 --> 30:19.382
and to be honest, she's not
that good of an actress.

30:19.426 --> 30:20.557
Sorry, Willa.

30:20.601 --> 30:22.385
- But you did invite her
to the house?

30:22.429 --> 30:23.952
- Yeah.

30:23.996 --> 30:26.302
I thought she had a special
quality, that she'd fit in.

30:26.346 --> 30:28.739
- But you didn't
ask her to join--why?

30:28.783 --> 30:30.785
- The next morning,
Tate and Liam told me

30:30.829 --> 30:32.308
she'd said negative things
about me.

30:32.352 --> 30:36.008
That she was toxic,
had bad energy.

30:36.051 --> 30:38.880
But later that day,
I overheard them talking about

30:38.924 --> 30:42.014
"shutting that bitch down."

30:42.057 --> 30:43.711
- What did you take
that to mean?

30:43.754 --> 30:46.148
- They were trying to discredit
any allegation she might make.

30:46.192 --> 30:48.934
I regret not telling
the police that earlier.

30:48.977 --> 30:53.155
- Well, thank you for coming
forward now, Mr. Wheeler.

30:53.199 --> 30:55.418
- In the past,
when you've invited

30:55.462 --> 30:57.899
female content providers
to the house,

30:57.943 --> 30:59.814
they didn't provide
anything more

30:59.858 --> 31:01.903
than content to you,
did they?

31:01.947 --> 31:03.557
- Not really.
No.

31:03.600 --> 31:06.952
- But a lot of them hooked up
with Tate and/or Liam, right?

31:06.995 --> 31:08.388
- I guess.

31:08.431 --> 31:11.304
- All the women like you,
but not that way.

31:11.347 --> 31:14.350
You're a good guy,
you do everything by the book,

31:14.394 --> 31:17.788
and then the women come in,
and they don't even see you.

31:17.832 --> 31:19.747
That must gnaw away at you
over time.

31:19.790 --> 31:21.923
- Objection.
- Witness may answer,

31:21.967 --> 31:24.360
but move along, Mr. Swope.

31:24.404 --> 31:26.275
- I'm not there to hook up.
I run the house.

31:26.319 --> 31:28.190
It wouldn't be professional
to cross those lines.

and then my clients

31:30.062 --> 31:32.020

31:32.064 --> 31:33.761
And then you met Willa.

seemed special to you.

to meeting with her.

These all yours?

31:49.559 --> 31:50.996
- Yes.

31:51.039 --> 31:53.259
- So when the four of you
were in the hot tub,

31:53.302 --> 31:57.045
and Willa was flirting
with Tate and Liam,

31:57.089 --> 31:58.525
how much of that hurt
your feelings?

31:58.568 --> 32:02.572
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Mr. Swope, move on.

32:02.616 --> 32:05.967
- Mr. Wheeler,
you reached out to Willa

32:06.011 --> 32:08.578
after she posted
her rape video.

32:08.622 --> 32:10.972
Now was that just an excuse
to see her again?

32:11.016 --> 32:13.453
- No, I legitimately felt bad
about what had happened to her.

32:13.496 --> 32:14.802
- Bad or angry?

32:14.845 --> 32:16.195
Because we have a video
where she gets

32:16.238 --> 32:18.588
out of a hot tub,
you put a towel over her.

32:18.632 --> 32:20.199
- I was trying to take
care of her.

32:20.242 --> 32:22.070
- Oh, you weren't trying
to get her into your room?

32:22.114 --> 32:23.463
- No!

32:23.506 --> 32:25.204
She shouldn't have gone
into anybody's room.

32:25.247 --> 32:27.249
She was drunk.
I mean, she wasn't a partier.

32:27.293 --> 32:29.034
- But you must have seen
other girls

32:29.077 --> 32:30.905
go into Tate and Liam's room.

32:30.949 --> 32:34.082
Maybe a little high.
Did you object?

32:34.126 --> 32:36.084
- I don't--I don't know.
- Hmm.

32:36.128 --> 32:37.956
You didn't.

32:37.999 --> 32:41.046
See, it's not that
you're such a great guy.

32:41.089 --> 32:43.004
You just didn't like
any of those other girls

32:43.048 --> 32:45.093

32:45.137 --> 32:48.140
You're jealous that she wanted
my clients and not you.

32:48.183 --> 32:50.969
- She didn't want them.
- How do you know that?

32:51.012 --> 32:53.449
Is that because
you thought she liked you?

32:53.493 --> 32:54.973
- She did like me.

32:55.016 --> 32:58.541

she was bad news.

that you were the big dogs.

38:21.386 --> 38:23.953
- "You guys,
I'm totally freaking out.

38:23.997 --> 38:25.999
"The Wheelhouse just DMed me

38:26.042 --> 38:28.262
"and invited me over
for a collab.

38:28.306 --> 38:31.221
All goes well, I could be
their newest member"?

38:33.223 --> 38:35.182
But after the verdict,
they can do whatever they want.

38:35.225 --> 38:38.141
- Yeah, maybe.
But not before the verdict.

38:41.057 --> 38:44.322
- DMing a jury member
during the trial.

38:44.365 --> 38:47.325
Offering her entry
to the Wheelhouse.

38:47.368 --> 38:50.284
I'm looking at jury tampering,
bribery.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.373
- Your Honor, this is the first
that I'm hearing about this.

38:52.417 --> 38:54.114
- Yeah, well, I should
certainly hope so.

38:54.157 --> 38:57.030
- We also have evidence
that the defendants

38:57.073 --> 38:59.946
DMed a second juror,
Brian Cummings,

38:59.989 --> 39:01.295
also during the trial,

39:01.339 --> 39:03.776
inviting him to become
a member of the Wheelhouse

39:03.819 --> 39:05.386
in exchange
for a not guilty verdict.

39:05.430 --> 39:09.782
And I quote, "If the jury
acquits, the Wheelhouse fits."

39:09.825 --> 39:11.392
- Very clever, gentlemen.

39:11.436 --> 39:13.176
Do you have anything
to say for yourselves?

39:13.220 --> 39:14.961
- That's just how we recruit.
- Yeah.

39:15.004 --> 39:16.745
Like Willa said,
the timing is a coincidence.

39:16.789 --> 39:19.052
- Okay, that's enough.

39:19.095 --> 39:20.445
Your Honor,
I'll have to verify this.

39:20.488 --> 39:22.055
- Well, you do so, Mr. Swope,

39:22.098 --> 39:23.752
because if this turns out
to be true,

39:23.796 --> 39:26.364
your clients could be looking
at double digits.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.238
- They'll get over ten years
in prison?

39:31.281 --> 39:32.761
- Their lawyer cut a deal,

39:32.805 --> 39:34.894
so they'll get seven
and they'll be out in five.

39:34.937 --> 39:38.158
- Still, they'll be so old.

39:38.201 --> 39:41.422
I just wanted an apology.

39:41.466 --> 39:43.119
- We're so sorry, Willa,

39:43.163 --> 39:46.166
and we did everything
that we could.

39:46.209 --> 39:49.125
- I know.
At least Diggy apologized.

39:49.169 --> 39:52.041
He invited me
to join the Wheelhouse.

39:52.085 --> 39:55.175
- Hold on, Willa, are you sure?
- This is different.

39:55.218 --> 39:58.744
He invited me and Kavon.
We're gonna rebrand.

39:58.787 --> 40:01.747
A new collective,
kind of like a survivor squad.

40:01.790 --> 40:05.228
It'll be a place for survivors
of sexual assault,

40:05.272 --> 40:08.362
discrimination,
mental health issues.

40:08.406 --> 40:11.278
- Wheeler certainly knows how
to land on his feet,

40:11.321 --> 40:13.323
but it sounds like
a good thing.

40:13.367 --> 40:17.371
- He did right,
and so did Counselor Carisi.

40:17.415 --> 40:18.981
Would you guys
thank him for me?

40:19.025 --> 40:23.029
- We can do that.
- He's a nice guy.

40:23.072 --> 40:24.944
To me,
he's one of the good ones.

40:24.987 --> 40:26.772
And for what it's worth,

40:26.815 --> 40:29.078
I can see
how much he likes you.

40:37.086 --> 40:39.785
- So we are looking
at sex trafficking.

40:39.828 --> 40:41.743
Does your informant
have any idea where Rita is?

40:41.787 --> 40:45.181
- No, but he did find out
that there is a shipment

40:45.225 --> 40:47.401
of new prospects
coming in from Albania--

40:47.445 --> 40:49.229
12 underage girls.

40:49.272 --> 40:52.232
- When does the plane land?
- Eight hours from now, at JFK.

40:52.275 --> 40:53.842
- I'll let Stabler know.

40:53.886 --> 40:58.020
Make sure he's part of the crew
picking up the girls.

40:58.064 --> 41:00.545
- We may need your ongoing
help with this, Captain.

41:00.588 --> 41:03.809
- Always.
