WEBVTT

00:04.337 --> 00:07.539
Well, every so often
we come across

00:07.541 --> 00:09.274
one of these kinds
of stories.

00:09.276 --> 00:12.411
This peach of a piece comes
to us from down south

00:12.413 --> 00:15.014
where a Georgia man
claims to have seen

00:15.016 --> 00:16.215
bigfoot.

00:16.216 --> 00:19.084
Yes, that's right, bigfoot.

00:19.086 --> 00:21.653
Michael joneses
of calamityville,

00:21.655 --> 00:24.623
says that the legendary creature
walked right by him

00:24.625 --> 00:26.291
while at a local creek.

00:26.293 --> 00:29.762
Joneses tells wrxh
that he and a friend

00:29.764 --> 00:32.363
were walking through the woods
when it happened.

00:32.366 --> 00:36.535
I was there.
I was right there, you know?

00:36.537 --> 00:39.038
And he was right there.

00:39.040 --> 00:42.174
And he looked me
right in the eye.

00:42.176 --> 00:46.078
I look at my friend,
and he just shrugged
like nothing happened.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.679
You said it was dark, correct?

00:47.681 --> 00:49.381
Oh, yes, ma'am.

00:49.383 --> 00:52.484
Maybe too dark to really
make out what you were seeing?

00:52.486 --> 00:54.620
Oh, no, no matter.

00:54.622 --> 01:00.359
Day, night, light, or dark,
big is always gonna be big.

01:05.298 --> 01:09.368
That's right, "big is always
going to be big."

01:09.370 --> 01:12.271
Apparently they tried
to interview the other
eyewitness,

01:12.273 --> 01:14.073
but he declined to comment.

01:14.075 --> 01:15.407
Well, there you have it, folks,

01:15.409 --> 01:18.277
even bigfoot
likes Southern hospitality.

01:25.118 --> 01:28.353
No, we talked about this.
It's "project bigfoot."

01:28.355 --> 01:29.755
Oh, my gosh,
that sounds lame.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.558
It should be

01:32.560 --> 01:34.426
you know, make it sound
scary, dude.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.762
Moose, we said
"project bigfoot"
in the movie.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.230
And you saw it.
It's not scary.

01:38.232 --> 01:40.232
We're going with

01:40.234 --> 01:41.800
Okay, you tell me
what sounds better,

01:43.770 --> 01:45.704
or

01:45.706 --> 01:47.272
Moose, you're just doing
a better voice

01:47.274 --> 01:48.740
-for the one that you want.
-No, I wasn't.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.242
When's the last time
you heard the title

01:50.244 --> 01:51.844
being said as it came up
on the screen?

01:51.846 --> 01:53.879
Never, why are you
doing this?

01:53.881 --> 01:56.248
Okay, I'm telling you, Steve,
it's the way the business

01:56.250 --> 01:58.117
Stop! It's...

01:58.119 --> 01:59.785
And that's the end
of the conversation, okay?

01:59.787 --> 02:01.720
Fine, you're the boss,
you get what you want.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.455
- Thank you.
- Yep.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.290
- I respect you.
- I appreciate that.

02:12.398 --> 02:14.833
-Are we rolling?
-Yeah, man, go.

02:14.835 --> 02:17.636
The yeti.
Sasquatch.

02:17.638 --> 02:18.837
Skunk ape.

02:18.839 --> 02:20.439
The yowie.

02:20.441 --> 02:22.441
"Harry and the Hendersons."

02:22.443 --> 02:24.910
This supposed beast
dons many names

02:24.912 --> 02:27.646
from different regions
all around the globe,

02:27.648 --> 02:31.717
but we have all come
to know him as bigfoot.

02:32.785 --> 02:35.454
The million dollar
question is,

02:35.456 --> 02:37.823
does he exist?

02:37.825 --> 02:40.292
Stay tuned as we interview
several people

02:40.294 --> 02:43.896
who claim,
yes, he does!

02:45.465 --> 02:47.332
Is that going to be
the beginning?

02:47.334 --> 02:50.369
Yeah! Yeah, I mean, might jazz
it up a little, I don't know,

02:50.371 --> 02:51.603
what do you think?

02:51.605 --> 02:53.572
Yeah, it's good.
Yeah, it's good.

02:53.574 --> 02:54.907
- No, that was kinda weak, dude.
 -What, really?

02:54.909 --> 02:56.608
I mean, maybe it needs
more of a hook.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.243
You know, like a twist?

02:58.245 --> 03:00.212
I can't put a twist in it.
It's a documentary.

03:00.214 --> 03:03.515
It's not made up, only the--
oh, this is it.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.651
Okay, guys, this is a very good
friend of mine,

03:05.653 --> 03:07.419
who has a lot of experience
with a camera.

03:07.421 --> 03:08.854
A true professional.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.590
So I'm begging the both of you,
especially you,

03:11.592 --> 03:13.759
- Unwarranted.
 -Be on your best behavior, okay?

03:13.761 --> 03:14.927
Always on
my best behavior, Steve.

03:14.929 --> 03:15.928
-Always?
-Always.

03:15.930 --> 03:17.563
Especially this time.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.298
This yeti guy better not
be a douchebag

03:19.300 --> 03:20.465
-because I think
i can only take...
-What?

03:20.467 --> 03:21.700
-Five days of douche.
-Moose.

03:21.702 --> 03:22.968
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.971
-Holy hotcakes!
-Don't say hotcakes.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.474
Best behavior. Best.

03:32.645 --> 03:35.447
Oh, my! Is that?

03:35.449 --> 03:37.716
-Dude, do you know
who that is, man?
-No.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.451
That's Jamie kerrigan.

03:39.453 --> 03:42.621
Oh, man, she was on
my flag football team.

03:42.623 --> 03:45.424
She is so hot and fast.

03:45.426 --> 03:48.227
Yeah, she's hot,
but she better not
get in my way.

03:48.229 --> 03:49.595
What do you mean,
"get in your way"?

03:49.597 --> 03:50.929
You know
what I'm talking about.

03:50.931 --> 03:52.864
Oh, yeah.
Wait, no, I don't.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.566
Do you even know
how to use that thing?

03:54.568 --> 03:56.635
Oh, yeah, kinda.

04:02.875 --> 04:03.942
Hi.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.978
I'm Jamie.

04:08.414 --> 04:09.948
Okay.

04:11.017 --> 04:12.417
Gummy bear?

04:12.419 --> 04:13.819
Oh, no, thanks.

04:13.821 --> 04:16.255
And we are off!

04:17.790 --> 04:19.324
-Have you been rolling
this whole time?
-Yeah.

04:19.326 --> 04:20.726
I told you you, don't need--

04:20.728 --> 04:22.828
Fancy schmancy hotel
accommodations.

04:22.830 --> 04:25.831
There's Jamie,
with her awesome diary.

04:25.833 --> 04:28.433
Moose, big old pocket knife.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.402
-Mickey.
-Your fly's open.

04:30.404 --> 04:33.739
- Yeah, I do that for fun
sometimes. It's funny.

04:33.741 --> 04:36.308
Okay, guys, this is
gonna be super fun.

04:36.310 --> 04:37.809
We're gonna do
a quick little intro.

04:37.811 --> 04:40.912
Okay, so just tell us
who you are, how you got here.

04:40.914 --> 04:43.415
What you hope to gain
from this experience,

04:43.417 --> 04:44.883
you blah, blah, blah.
You got it?

04:44.885 --> 04:46.985
-Yup.
-Sounds gay.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.321
Well, that doesn't even
make sense, but whatever,
you're doing it.

04:49.323 --> 04:51.723
I zipped it up, just in case
you're wondering.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.792
Oh, good, yeah,
I'm proud of you.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.694
Okay, great,
let's get started.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.562
Yeah, that bed is big enough
for the three of us, yeah?

04:57.564 --> 04:58.664
-Oh, the more the merrier.
-No, no.

04:58.666 --> 05:00.032
And action.

05:00.034 --> 05:04.736
Hi, I am Mickey.
I am 26 years old.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.938
I am from west palm beach,
Florida.

05:06.940 --> 05:09.007
Hi. I am Jamie.
I'm a researcher

05:09.009 --> 05:12.044
and a fellow camera operator
on project bigfoot.

05:12.046 --> 05:15.580
Yeah, moose.
Real name's Franklin Simmons.

05:15.582 --> 05:17.416
So you can understand
why I go by moose.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.785
I like football.

05:19.787 --> 05:22.321
I like to play racquetball.

05:22.323 --> 05:26.024
I don't if there is
a bigfoot, but...

05:26.026 --> 05:27.959
Who knows, you know?

05:27.961 --> 05:29.628
That's why I'm here, I guess.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.563
Bigfoot is bullshit.

05:31.565 --> 05:34.666
I am 5' 4 1/2",

05:34.668 --> 05:36.501
140 pounds.

05:36.503 --> 05:39.037
- And I work at the--
- What are you doing?

05:39.039 --> 05:40.706
You said to introduce myself.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.908
Yeah, but this isn't--
this isn't eharmony, okay?

05:42.910 --> 05:44.776
Just tell us
about the project
and why you're here.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.978
-I'm sorry, man,
that's-- all right.
-It's easy.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.747
All right, um, hi!

05:48.749 --> 05:51.717
I am Mickey.
I am here for audio.

05:51.719 --> 05:54.686
I work at the olive garden.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.756
I'm pretty stoked, I think.

05:57.758 --> 06:00.625
So Steve asked me
to come up here.

06:00.627 --> 06:02.594
So whatev's, I'm here.

06:02.596 --> 06:05.097
- Brought my gun.
- Oh, sweet.

06:05.099 --> 06:06.898
I am 5' 4 1/2".

06:06.900 --> 06:09.067
I am 140--

06:09.069 --> 06:10.602
You already said that.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.070
Steve, I'm not good
at this stuff, man.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.639
So, it should be fun.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.743
Steve, she didn't say
how tall she was.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.378
- That's fine.
- Copy.

06:19.380 --> 06:22.114
So, if there is a bigfoot,

06:22.116 --> 06:23.648
you better watch out

06:23.650 --> 06:25.083
cause the moose
is coming for you.

06:26.018 --> 06:28.920
Hi, I'm the team leader, Steve.

06:28.922 --> 06:32.023
- Or captain Steve.
-  -I'm not calling you captain Steve.

06:32.025 --> 06:34.393
For five days,
i and my brave team,

06:34.395 --> 06:35.994
will be alone
in the backwoods of Georgia,

06:35.996 --> 06:37.729
here in calamityville.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.464
It was here
that the last known sighting

06:39.466 --> 06:42.601
of bigfoot took place,
only 12 days ago.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.503
We plan to investigate.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.872
Not only will we talk
to professors and scientists,

06:46.874 --> 06:48.173
but we'll also talk to locals

06:48.175 --> 06:49.474
who say that they've
seen bigfoot

06:49.476 --> 06:51.076
with their very own eyes.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.445
I've spent 10 years
dedicating my life

06:53.447 --> 06:54.946
to the research
of bigfoot.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.115
So there's no hiding the fact
that I strongly believe

06:57.117 --> 06:58.950
that bigfoot exists.

06:58.952 --> 07:01.520
I also believe that by the end
of this project,

07:01.522 --> 07:04.790
the world will know more
about this mystifying creature.

07:04.792 --> 07:08.827
This is captain Steve
signing off.

07:08.829 --> 07:10.061
Stay tuned.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.863
10 years, Jesus, get a life!

07:11.865 --> 07:13.064
Come on, man, can you not--

07:21.874 --> 07:23.708
I admire the people
who go looking.

07:23.710 --> 07:25.010
What do you mean?

07:25.012 --> 07:27.145
The people that actually
go looking for bigfoot.

07:27.147 --> 07:28.513
They never find
anything, Steve.

07:28.515 --> 07:30.115
Yeah, but at least
they're trying.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.117
Yeah, but at least you got
a big interview set up, Steve.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.519
- I guess.
-  -Do you know what you're gonna ask yet?

07:34.521 --> 07:36.455
Yeah, I should be good.

07:36.457 --> 07:38.957
Hey, Steve, who's gonna
edit the movie?

07:38.959 --> 07:40.625
I don't know yet, why?

07:40.627 --> 07:42.661
I shot this short film
called, "blood brotherz."

07:42.663 --> 07:45.130
Steve, freakin' awesome.

07:47.000 --> 07:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:56.642 --> 08:02.581
Hey, bro? Bro?
Are you awake?

08:02.583 --> 08:05.016
Now I am.
What's up little brother?

08:05.018 --> 08:06.251
I can't do this
prison anymore.

08:06.253 --> 08:07.686
It's got me down.

08:07.688 --> 08:10.989
Then we need to get out
of this place.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.858
We need to do it now.

08:12.860 --> 08:17.662
-What's your plan?
-The big brother's
got a plan.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.664
We're gonna get you
the hell outta here.

08:20.766 --> 08:22.033
Come on little brother,
this way!

08:22.035 --> 08:24.135
No, it's locked!

08:25.905 --> 08:27.873
- Let's go!
- Thanks, man.

08:27.875 --> 08:31.610
Yeah, my cousin cut it.
He can edit your movie.
He's pretty good.

08:31.612 --> 08:34.145
Yeah?
Is he really any good,
or does he--?

08:34.147 --> 08:37.948
Hi, I'm here
with Michael joneses.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.284
Am I saying that correctly?

08:39.285 --> 08:41.052
-Joneses.
-Okay.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.087
-Mr. joneses.
-Yes, sir.

08:43.090 --> 08:45.957
You reported seeing bigfoot
almost two weeks ago,

08:45.959 --> 08:47.759
is that correct?

08:47.761 --> 08:48.827
Yes, sir.

08:48.829 --> 08:51.796
And you're sure
it was bigfoot?

08:51.798 --> 08:52.998
Yes, sir.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.199
That is very exciting.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.868
Where exactly
did you see him?

08:56.870 --> 08:58.203
Over there somewheres.

08:59.238 --> 09:00.205
Over there somewheres?

09:00.207 --> 09:02.040
Yes, sir.

09:02.042 --> 09:06.111
Okay, um, and--
and what did he look like?

09:06.113 --> 09:07.312
Big.

09:07.314 --> 09:09.214
-He looked big.
-Yes, sir.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.715
Just big?

09:10.717 --> 09:12.017
Yes, sir.

09:14.754 --> 09:16.254
Shh.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.989
Uh, were there
any other details

09:17.991 --> 09:20.625
about the sighting?

09:20.627 --> 09:22.961
-No, sir.
-I was really expecting
a "yes, sir" there.

09:22.963 --> 09:25.297
Uh, were you with
any one at the time?

09:25.299 --> 09:26.798
Yes, sir.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.233
-Okay, great. Who?
-Willie ray.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.302
-Willie ray.
-Yes, sir.

09:30.304 --> 09:32.771
-And where does he live?
-Over there somewheres.

09:34.206 --> 09:36.107
Yes, sir?

09:36.109 --> 09:38.677
-What the hell was that?
-That was a very bad
interview, Steve.

09:38.679 --> 09:41.146
Oh, that was a very bad
interview? Oh, thanks moose.

09:41.148 --> 09:42.814
Are they all gonna
be like that, Steve?

09:42.816 --> 09:44.182
I don't know.
I hope not.

09:46.886 --> 09:48.219
The interviews
are not gonna cut it.

09:48.221 --> 09:50.255
- Mm-mmm.
- Guys, I have an idea.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.957
- No.
- Yes.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.725
What if we actually
looked for bigfoot.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.026
- I'm in 100%.
- Steve.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.828
Guys, hear me out, okay?

09:56.830 --> 09:58.763
As of right now,
what are we doing?
What are we doing?

09:58.765 --> 10:00.165
We're making a movie
with interviews.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.067
-Okay, that's boring.
-Snoozefest.

10:02.069 --> 10:04.636
-Why can't we look for him?
-Because he doesn't exist.

10:04.638 --> 10:05.837
Well, it doesn't
hurt to try, right?

10:05.839 --> 10:07.339
I say we camp out
for a few weeks

10:07.341 --> 10:09.207
-and really investigate.
-No way, man.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.009
I would rather watch
every Tyler Perry movie.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.311
Steve, I gotta work next week.
You know that.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.280
-Ooh, where do you work?
-Yeah, where do you work?

10:15.282 --> 10:17.015
Why?

10:17.017 --> 10:19.217
I don't know,
i just think maybe
i could come in,

10:19.219 --> 10:21.186
-like, hey, Jamie,
what's happening?
You'd be like,

10:21.188 --> 10:23.722
"you are a stud."
I'd be like, "stop,
you're embarrassing me,

10:23.724 --> 10:25.123
but I secretly
want you to keep going."

10:25.125 --> 10:27.325
- I need a job.
- Mm-hmm, okay.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.294
No, let's just head back
into town and then--

10:29.296 --> 10:30.729
What?

10:30.731 --> 10:32.063
- Oh, Jesus!
- Deliverance!

10:32.065 --> 10:35.934
Roll your window down.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.869
- Uh, no, thanks!
- No, thank you.

10:37.871 --> 10:40.071
- You guys the bigfoot people, right?
-  -Nope.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.306
- We're not?
- No. Tell him--

10:41.308 --> 10:43.908
- Say no.
- Say no.

10:43.910 --> 10:47.012
-I stepped in shit.
-He stepped in shit.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.013
Oh, god.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.415
Okay, I am here with Earl,

10:50.417 --> 10:53.351
and Earl is claiming
to have seen bigfoot.

10:53.353 --> 10:57.022
-Is that correct?
-That's right, but he won't
let anybody see him.

10:57.024 --> 10:59.391
-What do you mean?
-Well, you see, the thing
with bigfoot is,

10:59.393 --> 11:01.893
if he wants to be seen,
then you can see him,

11:01.895 --> 11:04.029
but if he don't,
then you ain't gonna see him.

11:04.031 --> 11:06.131
That's just--
that's just the way it is.

11:06.133 --> 11:08.199
-It's just like that.
-But he is somewhere
in these woods?

11:08.201 --> 11:09.768
Oh, no, yeah, no,
he's around here.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.336
No, he's definitely
somewhere here, yeah.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.904
But only if he wants
to be seen.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.305
That's right.
That's right.

11:14.307 --> 11:15.907
-And you've only
seen him once?
-Me, oh, yes,

11:15.909 --> 11:18.276
I've seen him one time,
but Willie ray, he--

11:18.278 --> 11:19.778
the Willie ray that lives
over there somewheres.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.212
Yeah, that's him!
That's right, yeah.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.747
Yeah, he's seen him.

11:22.749 --> 11:24.816
The other day i-- well,
i bumped into Willie ray

11:24.818 --> 11:26.985
and he-- we was fishing
and he was telling--

11:26.987 --> 11:29.788
he runs into bigfoot
and then they'll hang out

11:29.790 --> 11:31.856
and play games,
and go dancing,

11:31.858 --> 11:33.091
and Indian wrestle
and stuff like that.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.125
-Bigfoot?
-That's right.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.461
Wow. Can you describe him?

11:36.463 --> 11:38.830
Oh, yeah, no,
he's about eight feet tall.

11:38.832 --> 11:41.900
He's got a big old head,
big old hair.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.868
Strong.
He's real strong,

11:43.870 --> 11:45.303
you know?

11:45.305 --> 11:47.272
He's like a gorilla man strong.

11:47.274 --> 11:49.240
Wow, wow, thank you
so much, Earl.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.242
-Thank you very much.
-Oh, man, no think
nothing of it.

11:51.244 --> 11:54.112
That's fine.
Y'all be careful now, okay?

11:54.114 --> 11:58.083
Wouldn't want anything bad
to happen to any of you.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.819
All I'm saying is
why would he even say that?

12:00.821 --> 12:02.120
Don't listen to him, man.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.955
An eight feet tall
gorilla man?

12:03.957 --> 12:05.924
That crusty bastard
was crazy.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.759
- I can hear everything
you're saying.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.794
Go, Jamie, attack!

12:09.796 --> 12:12.263
I was-- we were talking--
i meant another crusty bastard.

12:12.265 --> 12:13.798
Not you.

12:16.102 --> 12:18.136
-Why's he following us?
-Where were you on that, ass?

12:18.138 --> 12:20.472
-I didn't see him.
-Shut up and keep on moving.

12:20.474 --> 12:24.309
All right, I'll let you be.

12:24.311 --> 12:26.044
Did he just say
he's gonna let us be?

12:26.046 --> 12:27.378
Well, wait, what does it mean?

12:27.380 --> 12:28.847
What the hell
was he planning on doing?

12:28.849 --> 12:30.148
-He's gonna kill us.
-Don't say that.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.083
Shh.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.952
Do we really have to be here
for five days, Steve?

12:33.954 --> 12:35.420
Steve, let's just go
into town, okay?

12:35.422 --> 12:37.088
Yeah, yeah,
let's go into town.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.923
-Okay.
-Yeah, double time.
Let's go!

12:38.925 --> 12:41.259
Look, Steve, I really think
we can get everything we need

12:41.261 --> 12:43.928
-in two days, right?
-I say we find a deer,

12:43.930 --> 12:47.198
shoot it, skin it, eat it,
and then we leave.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.267
Ooh! That's a movie, Steve!

12:49.269 --> 12:51.236
-I would watch that.
-We have five days to get
what we need.

12:51.238 --> 12:52.971
We have a lot left to shoot
and we'll be here

12:52.973 --> 12:54.973
for the remainder of it.
That's what we signed up for.

12:54.975 --> 12:57.408
-I didn't sign up for anything.
-You know what I meant, Mickey.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.410
-Did you sign up for something?
-Yeah, it's a long agreement.

12:59.412 --> 13:01.546
-Oh, great.
-He did sound pretty
sure of himself, huh?

13:01.548 --> 13:04.415
-Who Earl?
-He sounded like a lunatic.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.951
We are in unchartered
territory here, guys.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.354
-We can be on to something!
-You know what we're on to?

13:09.356 --> 13:11.055
Finding more
homicidal maniacs--

13:11.057 --> 13:12.123
five days!

13:12.125 --> 13:14.425
Ugh! I hate this, dude.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.261
-This is a nightmare.
-Well--

13:16.263 --> 13:18.329
-hi.
-I say it right here.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.064
-Yes.
-All right.

13:20.066 --> 13:22.233
-Hi, I'm here with Walter--
-but how am I gonna talk to you

13:22.235 --> 13:24.068
-if I'm looking in the--
-you can look at both.

13:24.070 --> 13:25.270
At both of you? All right.

13:25.272 --> 13:26.938
Hi, I'm here with Walter Lee.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.840
Hi, I'm here with Reggie.

13:28.842 --> 13:31.342
Hi, I'm here with um--

13:31.344 --> 13:33.411
I'm sorry,
what was your name?

13:33.413 --> 13:37.282
It's on my vest.

13:37.284 --> 13:39.584
- Are your kids
okay in there?

13:39.586 --> 13:41.252
They're fine.
Don't worry about 'em.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.354
Okay, are you sure?

13:43.356 --> 13:44.856
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I fed 'em.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.391
-Sure, I've seen bigfoot?
-You have?

13:46.393 --> 13:48.226
-Yeah, I've seen him.
-Can you describe him for us?

13:48.228 --> 13:51.262
Sure, yeah, I mean, I saw him.
He's a big hairy guy.

13:51.264 --> 13:52.997
I was sittin' on the couch
with my old lady

13:52.999 --> 13:54.332
and we was watching
the television

13:54.334 --> 13:55.934
and he come across
in that thing where--

13:55.936 --> 13:57.502
-no, no, not on TV.
-He's walking and turned around.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.270
In real life
with your own eyes.

13:59.272 --> 14:02.273
-Oh, like real--
like-- like in 3-d.
-Yes.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.309
Sure, I've seen--
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
i seen him.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.878
Everybody know that
they be with them chickens

14:06.880 --> 14:09.247
and they be laughing and who
gonna go and bail 'em out?

14:09.249 --> 14:11.382
Cecil gonna bail 'em out,
that's who gonna bail 'em out.

14:11.384 --> 14:16.154
Okay, I think that
we actually have another
interview to get to.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.956
I'm talking about bigfoot.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.224
Steve, let me take
commando over here.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.291
Why, what are you gonna do?

14:20.293 --> 14:21.893
I got it.

14:21.895 --> 14:23.261
Hey there, moose.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.496
We're doing
a documentary on bigfoot

14:25.498 --> 14:27.632
and we thought maybe
we could have you share

14:27.634 --> 14:29.267
some information with us.

14:29.269 --> 14:30.902
Oh, yeah, yeah,
i sure would.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.370
-Whatever you need to know.
-What's your name?

14:32.372 --> 14:34.606
-My name is junior.
-Junior, all right, junior.

14:34.608 --> 14:36.174
So, have you seen
bigfoot before?

14:36.176 --> 14:37.642
Mm-hmm, I did--
nah, I didn't see him

14:37.644 --> 14:39.244
-but I actually heard him.
-Oh, wow, you heard him?

14:39.246 --> 14:40.411
-I heard him groan.
-Oh, wow.

14:40.413 --> 14:41.613
I heard his calling.

14:41.615 --> 14:43.181
Well, there is
no scientific fact

14:43.183 --> 14:44.616
that says he doesn't exist.

14:44.618 --> 14:47.318
There's no scientific fact
that says he does exist.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.586
Okay, well, there's
no scientific fact

14:48.588 --> 14:50.021
that says he doesn't exist.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.456
He has a job?

14:51.458 --> 14:53.491
Well, yeah, he works over
in George cardel dodge.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.093
Okay, I think you're thinking
of an inflatable balloon.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.628
No, he's got that-- you know,
he stands out in front.

14:56.630 --> 14:58.663
He's got this sign tells you
how much cars are.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.531
-He waves to people that go by.
-That's an inflatable balloon.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.400
You seen him,
he goes like this,

15:02.402 --> 15:05.670
-if you see a fella doing this,
it's probably bigfoot.
-Okay.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.972
Are you guys filming
around here?

15:07.974 --> 15:10.074
Doing stuff?
Going around town?

15:10.076 --> 15:11.309
Yup, we're shooting
a documentary.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.977
Don't go to Joe's groceries.

15:12.979 --> 15:15.313
-Why?
-He's a dick.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.048
Oh, so you heard him?
What did he sound like?

15:17.050 --> 15:18.583
You know what?
He sound like a--

15:18.585 --> 15:21.319
he sound like a--
like a--

15:28.427 --> 15:30.161
Oh, so like a wolf.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.297
Okay, well, I happen to think
that there is a bigfoot.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.999
Well, there isn't.
Keep dreaming.

15:35.001 --> 15:37.368
There ain't nothin' around here
except nothin'.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.636
-You don't know.
So there's--
-no.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.305
There's a possibility
in that head.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.173
Well, yeah.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.409
Well, yeah,
there's gorillas.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.044
There's all kinds
of animals.

15:46.046 --> 15:48.079
No, man, it's not like a wolf.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.347
I mean, it was more like a--

15:49.349 --> 15:51.382
like a--
oh! Like a growl.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.717
-Oh.
-Like a--

15:52.719 --> 15:54.585
like a--

16:00.659 --> 16:02.593
So, like a bear.

16:02.595 --> 16:05.296
If we wanted to find bigfoot,
where would you suggest we go?

16:05.298 --> 16:07.098
Oh, you gotta go talk
to Willie ray.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.299
Yeah.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.201
I don't believe
in everything I see.

16:10.203 --> 16:11.269
You believe
in loch ness monster?

16:11.271 --> 16:12.704
I do.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.674
Rumor has it bigfoot
smells like a wet dog.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.576
Have you ever experienced
a wet dog smell?

16:18.578 --> 16:21.612
-Yeah, there's wet dogs
around here.
-Oh.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.581
They smell like wet dogs.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.383
You ever heard,
um, like a--

16:25.385 --> 16:27.085
-like a cat in heat
get real scared?
-Never.

16:27.087 --> 16:28.619
Like a, um--
like a-- like a--

16:31.991 --> 16:36.394
So, junior, what you're saying
is it was a cat?

16:36.396 --> 16:38.229
Come on, it's okay, buddy,
it was a cat.

16:38.231 --> 16:41.366
If you need any help
with any of the filming here,

16:41.368 --> 16:43.101
I'd be, you know,
absolutely--

16:43.103 --> 16:44.435
Oh, are you a filmmaker?

16:44.437 --> 16:46.204
-No.
-Oh.

16:46.206 --> 16:49.007
-If you ever actually
see bigfoot...
-Yeah?

16:49.009 --> 16:52.377
-Please, just give us a call.
-Again, you mean?

16:52.379 --> 16:55.380
-Was it a cat?
It was a cat?
-Well, uh--

16:55.382 --> 16:57.315
-well, it probably was a cat.
-Yeah, see, it was a cat.

16:57.317 --> 16:59.317
Thank you so much, junior.
It was a cat.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.252
Thank you for your time.
- Nice to meet you, Rambo.

17:01.254 --> 17:03.321
Hey, Steve,
i was thinking,

17:03.323 --> 17:04.622
since moose got a turn,

17:04.624 --> 17:06.656
can I try?

17:06.659 --> 17:08.760
I don't know, Mickey,
i don't think that would be
such a good idea.

17:08.762 --> 17:10.528
And action!

17:11.696 --> 17:13.231
Sir...

17:15.034 --> 17:16.534
- How tall are you?
- Cut.

17:16.536 --> 17:17.769
I get so nervous.

17:19.637 --> 17:22.339
So, we are now on our way
to Willie Ray's house.

17:22.342 --> 17:25.643
Willie Ray's been mentioned
by a couple of the locals
a few times already,

17:25.645 --> 17:28.279
so we definitely
had to go talk to him.

17:28.281 --> 17:31.649
Apparently he's had a few
run-ins with the alleged beast.

17:31.651 --> 17:34.452
Any information he can give us
will be very helpful

17:34.454 --> 17:37.789
in the on-going search
for the mystic monster.

17:37.791 --> 17:40.091
Mystic monster!

17:40.093 --> 17:41.459
Man, you just gave me
goosebumps!

17:41.461 --> 17:43.561
Yeah, and if my directions
are correct,

17:43.563 --> 17:45.563
we should be there
fairly shortly.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.098
- Stop!
- No!

17:47.100 --> 17:48.299
- Stop the car, Jamie!
- No, what?

17:48.301 --> 17:49.634
- Shh. Quiet!
- Of course.

17:49.636 --> 17:50.768
What is it?

17:50.770 --> 17:52.503
Of course.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.272
Maybe he has to go
to the bathroom or something,

17:54.274 --> 17:56.174
Oh, scared me.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.542
Am I bleeding?

17:57.544 --> 17:59.744
I don't know. No.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.146
Just looks crooked.

18:02.148 --> 18:04.215
No, it doesn't.

18:04.217 --> 18:05.817
I think that's how
it normally looks.

18:05.819 --> 18:07.285
I don't see anything
over there.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.320
Steve, what is it?

18:09.322 --> 18:11.122
I saw him.

18:11.124 --> 18:13.858
- Ah, here we go.
-  -Moose, did you see him?

18:13.860 --> 18:16.094
- Yeah, I did, didn't you?
-  -No.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.795
That leprechaun
that was riding that unicorn,

18:17.797 --> 18:19.797
- he was right next to it.
- Shut up, moose.

18:19.799 --> 18:22.600
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:25.204 --> 18:28.206
I mean, I mean
i think I saw him.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.208
It was just over there.
You guys didn't see anything?

18:30.210 --> 18:31.742
- No.
- No.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.744
Okay, so you're not sure?

18:37.382 --> 18:38.716
No.

18:40.486 --> 18:43.788
Hey, Steve, none of us saw
a goddamn thing.

18:43.790 --> 18:47.191
So get in the car,
and let's go!

18:48.127 --> 18:49.393
Yeah.

18:50.395 --> 18:51.462
All right, here we are.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.564
This is scary.

18:55.434 --> 18:57.768
Don't sing the "nightmare
on elm street" song.

19:00.773 --> 19:04.442
Okay, shh.
 All right, everybody got their stuff?

19:04.444 --> 19:05.476
Yeah.

19:11.183 --> 19:13.384
Oh, my god,
it's Jeffrey dahmer's house.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.319
- Great Steve.
-  -It's not Jeffrey dahmer's house.

19:15.321 --> 19:16.654
Okay, well, maybe
it's Ted Bundy's.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.222
Okay, let's just go.

19:18.224 --> 19:19.490
Or the btk killer.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.425
Ooh, maybe
the night stalker.

19:21.427 --> 19:23.561
- Moose, stop it!
- Lower your voice.

19:23.563 --> 19:25.296
Lower your face.

19:27.766 --> 19:31.235
All right, guys,
let's all stay professional.

19:39.211 --> 19:40.411
What the hell do you want?

19:40.413 --> 19:41.546
Uh, hi, Mr. ray.

19:41.548 --> 19:42.880
Yeah, that's Willie ray.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.315
Willie ray, right.

19:44.317 --> 19:47.752
Uh, I'm Steve.
Or captain Steve.

19:47.754 --> 19:50.188
You don't have to call me that.
Just Steve would be fine.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.956
This is Jamie, and Mickey--

19:51.958 --> 19:53.624
just state
your goddamn business.

19:53.626 --> 19:56.194
Okay.
Many of the locals
have said

19:56.196 --> 19:58.529
that you've encountered
bigfoot several times

19:58.531 --> 20:01.933
and we're a documentary crew,
hence the cameras.

20:01.935 --> 20:03.367
We were just wondering
if we could have

20:03.369 --> 20:06.237
some information
on bigfoot for our film.

20:11.778 --> 20:15.980
I think you oughta
take your cameras and leave.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.349
Okay, we'll do that.

20:18.351 --> 20:22.720
It's just if there's
any information you have
about bigfoot, then--

20:22.722 --> 20:25.756
get outta here right now.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.458
Let's just go, Steve.

20:27.460 --> 20:30.361
Okay, okay, yeah,
we're gonna go.
Thank you.

20:30.363 --> 20:31.562
I'm kidding ya!

20:32.665 --> 20:34.632
I kidding ya! I kidding ya!

20:35.902 --> 20:37.868
He lives about two miles
west of here.

20:37.870 --> 20:40.605
-What?
-Yeah, yeah.

20:40.607 --> 20:42.540
- Wow.
- Oh, god.

20:44.711 --> 20:49.513
-I got you! I got you!
-I think I might need
a new pair of pants.

20:49.515 --> 20:51.682
- I'm serious.
-  -Oh, my god, it smells like shit.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.818
That was good.

20:53.820 --> 20:56.921
-That was good.
-So you actually have
information on bigfoot?

20:56.923 --> 20:59.924
Yeah, that old so and so,
son of a bitch owes me 20 bucks.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.459
He what?

21:01.461 --> 21:03.427
Oh, no, he's gonna pay,
and all that.

21:03.429 --> 21:05.630
Don't go putting anything
negative in your movie
about him,

21:05.632 --> 21:07.031
like he don't pay
his bills or nothin'.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.532
He does, he will.

21:08.534 --> 21:10.501
Look, come on in
and we'll talk about it.

21:10.503 --> 21:12.370
Yeah, hey, we'll get your friend
a new pair of pants.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.671
Somebody go
caca caca poo poo.

21:13.673 --> 21:14.805
That would be great.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.641
- Ah-ha!
- Okay.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.409
All right! Come on in!

21:18.411 --> 21:20.311
Yeah, we're gonna have
some fun tonight

21:20.313 --> 21:22.046
I got my specialty
cooking for dinner.

21:22.048 --> 21:24.015
- Oh, yeah!
- Great.

21:24.017 --> 21:25.716
All right. Sit down.
Take it easy.

21:25.718 --> 21:28.686
I'll do this.

21:28.688 --> 21:31.289
Okay, Jamie, why don't you put
your camera where moose is.

21:31.291 --> 21:33.457
I have a feeling
this is gonna be really good.

21:33.459 --> 21:35.026
I have a feeling
I'm gonna be sick.

21:35.028 --> 21:37.428
Uh, what's your guys'
favorite way to die?

21:37.430 --> 21:38.796
Don't say that.

21:40.432 --> 21:43.434
- All better?
- Feel like a grand piano.

21:43.436 --> 21:45.803
All right,
it's looking fine in there.
Looking fine.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.471
I'm making plenty
of food, folks,

21:47.473 --> 21:48.906
so y'all have
to stay for dinner.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.341
Well, that's awfully
nice of you.

21:50.343 --> 21:51.709
We'll consider it.
Thank you.

21:51.711 --> 21:53.711
Oh, good. I'm glad.

21:53.713 --> 21:55.780
Okay, so we're gonna
ask you a couple questions
about bigfoot,

21:55.782 --> 21:58.516
and all we ask is that you
are open and honest.

21:58.518 --> 22:02.086
Any stories or details you have
would be greatly appreciated.

22:02.088 --> 22:03.421
-Is that okay with you?
-Oh, yeah.

22:03.423 --> 22:04.989
That's more than okay.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.757
-Go ahead, shoot.
-All right.

22:06.759 --> 22:08.359
-My friend.
-Everybody ready?

22:08.361 --> 22:09.627
Speeding.

22:09.629 --> 22:11.329
- All systems go.
- Looks good.

22:11.331 --> 22:13.764
Great. So, Willie ray,

22:13.766 --> 22:15.566
many of the locals
we've talked to

22:15.568 --> 22:17.902
have said that you have had
several encounters with bigfoot,

22:17.904 --> 22:20.604
-is that true?
-Yeah, he comes around here
from time to time.

22:20.606 --> 22:21.639
Wait, here?

22:21.641 --> 22:22.973
Yeah, here, sure.

22:22.975 --> 22:25.776
Wow, okay.
Let me ask you this.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.411
If we were to go
searching for bigfoot,

22:27.413 --> 22:28.612
do you think
that there's a good chance

22:28.614 --> 22:30.114
that we would
actually find him?

22:30.116 --> 22:32.650
Yeah, that might happen,
but he might find you, too.

22:32.652 --> 22:34.452
You know, I tell you,
the thing is--

22:34.454 --> 22:37.054
you gonna smell him
before anything else,

22:37.056 --> 22:38.756
before you see him
and all that.

22:38.758 --> 22:42.526
You know, he'd be a mile away
and you'd smell him.

22:42.528 --> 22:45.763
I mean, hell, I smell
his ass all the time.

22:45.765 --> 22:47.498
Smell his ass.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.834
Okay, guys,
all right, yeah, okay.
Moving on.

22:49.836 --> 22:51.836
So if we smell him
that means we're close.

22:51.838 --> 22:54.138
We've been told that he smells
kinda like a wet dog.

22:54.140 --> 22:57.007
No, no, no, no.
Heard that, that's bullshit.

22:57.009 --> 22:58.743
That's bullshit!

22:58.745 --> 22:59.944
Hear that?

23:01.146 --> 23:03.047
No, it's like,
oh, what's that smell?

23:03.049 --> 23:04.382
Oh, you ever smell that,

23:04.384 --> 23:05.850
eh....

23:08.987 --> 23:11.122
-Passion fruit!
-Oh, he smells like
passion fruit?

23:11.124 --> 23:12.590
I didn't say that!

23:12.592 --> 23:13.958
Don't put words
in my mouth, boy!

23:13.960 --> 23:16.026
I just asked if you ever
smelled passion fruit.

23:16.028 --> 23:18.529
Uh, yes, we're sorry
about that.

23:18.531 --> 23:20.798
And we have definitely
smelled passion fruit.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.800
All right then.
He smells a lot like
passion fruit.

23:22.802 --> 23:25.503
Okay, Willie ray,

23:25.505 --> 23:30.040
earlier you had mentioned
that bigfoot owes you $20.

23:30.042 --> 23:32.443
Yup, yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:32.445 --> 23:35.146
- Right, so--
- Yeah, we need you
to explain that to us.

23:35.148 --> 23:38.916
Well, yeah.
He's gonna pay.

23:38.918 --> 23:41.685
I mean, I wanna get
one thing clear right now,

23:41.687 --> 23:43.187
he ain't a welcher.

23:43.189 --> 23:44.889
- Bigfoot ain't a welcher.
- Okay.

23:44.891 --> 23:46.056
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

23:46.058 --> 23:47.792
Ah, right, yeah,
we got that part,

23:47.794 --> 23:50.928
-but why does bigfoot owe--
-oh! Why, you said. Why?

23:50.930 --> 23:51.996
Why?

23:51.998 --> 23:54.031
Well, you know,
i tell you why.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.966
He likes to play
a lot of board games.

23:55.968 --> 23:59.770
Like candyland, and checkers,
and mousetrap,

23:59.772 --> 24:01.705
and all sorts
of what-have-yous.

24:01.707 --> 24:03.908
And, well, one night
we got to playing sorry.

24:03.910 --> 24:05.810
You ever play
the game sorry?

24:05.812 --> 24:07.445
- Never.
-  -Yes, yes, we all have.

24:07.447 --> 24:09.780
That's a good one, yeah.
You'd like it.

24:09.782 --> 24:12.850
So, one day, I whooped
his ass in sorry.

24:15.154 --> 24:17.855
And, you know, but it was
a healthy wager.

24:17.857 --> 24:19.723
I mean, nobody's
getting hurt and all that.

24:19.725 --> 24:21.125
It's just all friendly.

24:21.127 --> 24:23.494
Mm, that's interesting.

24:23.496 --> 24:27.465
Um, Willie ray,
i really hate to be forward,

24:27.467 --> 24:28.766
well, better than
being backwards.

24:29.902 --> 24:31.535
-He's right.
-That's right.

24:31.537 --> 24:33.838
-That's right!
-I don't know what that means.

24:33.840 --> 24:36.674
Hey, wait a minute!

24:36.676 --> 24:39.043
- What day is it?
- It's Tuesday.

24:39.045 --> 24:40.077
The 8th!

24:40.079 --> 24:42.613
-Uh, the 21st.
-Right, exactly!

24:42.615 --> 24:44.915
You guys are in luck.
Bigfoot's coming here tonight.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.116
- What?
- Really?

24:46.118 --> 24:47.651
Right, if my memory
serves me right.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.119
Okay, look, I have
to say something.

24:49.121 --> 24:51.021
Willie, you don't really
speak to bigfoot.

24:51.023 --> 24:54.191
You're just a crazy person,
no offense.

24:54.193 --> 24:55.926
Offense taken,
you big fat tub of lard.

24:55.928 --> 24:57.962
Now, hang on a minute.

24:57.964 --> 24:59.830
I am friends with Mr. foot.

24:59.832 --> 25:02.199
And I'm tired of you city folk
coming up here

25:02.201 --> 25:05.002
- and calling us pancakes.
- Pancakes?

25:05.004 --> 25:06.871
Here we go.
Here you go.

25:06.873 --> 25:08.772
Feast your eyes on that.

25:08.774 --> 25:10.741
Oh, my god.
Look, this is ridiculous.

25:10.743 --> 25:13.244
-Well, I wanna see. Whoa!
-Is that real?

25:13.246 --> 25:15.246
Of course it's real.
Are monkey pigeons real?

25:15.248 --> 25:17.581
- What the hell is a monkey pigeon?
-  -Steve, come on!

25:17.583 --> 25:20.651
And you're saying that bigfoot
is coming here tonight?

25:20.653 --> 25:22.219
Yeah, he's coming here tonight.

25:22.221 --> 25:23.821
I'm just lucky
i made enough food.

25:23.823 --> 25:25.089
Oh, my stew!

25:26.892 --> 25:31.161
- Okay, can I have a word with everybody?
-  -Of course.

25:31.163 --> 25:33.764
- We are leaving, right?
- Yes, yes.

25:33.766 --> 25:36.100
-No way.
-No, this photo is everything,

25:36.102 --> 25:38.135
That photo is nothing, man.
Are you kidding me?

25:38.137 --> 25:39.937
My god, Steve, that could be
a guy in a costume.

25:39.939 --> 25:41.739
This could be a guy
in a costume,

25:41.741 --> 25:44.542
but it could also be real, guys.
We have got something here.

25:44.544 --> 25:46.877
- Yeah, and who took that photo?
-  -Yeah.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.612
Can we please leave
before he comes back?

25:48.614 --> 25:49.780
No! He's harmless.

25:49.782 --> 25:50.915
He's kooky, yes,
but he's harmless.

25:50.917 --> 25:52.883
Steve, I know he's harmless,

25:52.885 --> 25:54.752
-but do you hear what
this man is saying?
-Of course.

25:54.754 --> 25:56.120
It's absolutely beyond
ridiculous.

25:56.122 --> 25:57.288
He is out there.

25:57.290 --> 25:58.689
He's like
cocoa puffs crazy, dude.

25:58.691 --> 26:00.958
And who the hell
is calling him pancake?

26:00.960 --> 26:03.661
Jamie, I think we have
to entertain the idea that
bigfoot is coming here tonight!

26:03.663 --> 26:05.596
Steve, are you listening
to yourself?

26:05.598 --> 26:07.197
Why are we here?
If we don't think
this is possible,

26:07.199 --> 26:09.233
- then why are we here?
- I don't know.

26:09.235 --> 26:11.902
Hey, he's a nice guy.
Look at these awesome
pants he gave me.

26:11.904 --> 26:16.173
Shut up! Shut up!
I am not eating raccoon soup

26:16.175 --> 26:18.042
or whatever the hell it is
that he is making in there.

26:18.044 --> 26:19.944
We are leaving now!

26:19.946 --> 26:22.012
Yeah, well, he insulted me,
but I am kinda hungry.

26:22.014 --> 26:24.181
Yeah, my mind's saying no,
but my tummy's saying yes
right now.

26:24.183 --> 26:26.917
-I hate you both.
-We are staying
and that's final.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.619
-All right.
-Willie ray!

26:28.621 --> 26:31.255
Ah, we are definitely
going to stay for a little bit,

26:31.257 --> 26:33.757
if that's cool.

26:33.759 --> 26:35.192
-I'm happy about that.
-Great.

26:35.194 --> 26:37.027
Yeah.

26:37.029 --> 26:39.930
Just so you know, little lady,
I'm not making raccoon soup.

26:39.932 --> 26:42.099
I'm making squirrel stew.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.602
There's a big difference
in the broth.

26:44.604 --> 26:46.170
It's thicker.

26:46.172 --> 26:48.706
Don't worry your pretty
little head about that, okay?

26:48.708 --> 26:51.809
Er, dah, dah, dah,
dah, dah.

26:51.811 --> 26:53.177
-She's not worried.
-I can't wait.

26:53.179 --> 26:55.112
Oh, god.
I'm nauseous.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.680
I was kinda hoping
for raccoon soup.

26:56.682 --> 26:58.616
It sounds exotic, huh?

26:58.618 --> 26:59.750
Yeah, you know what's exotic?

26:59.752 --> 27:01.251
- What?
- Your pants.

27:01.253 --> 27:02.953
- Whoa!
-  -Dude, those are awesome.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.622
-Hey, can I ask you one
question real quick?
-Sure.

27:04.624 --> 27:06.056
Are you two legit to quit?

27:06.058 --> 27:07.224
Yeah, hey, you know
how many dates

27:07.226 --> 27:08.292
you're gonna get
with those pants?

27:08.294 --> 27:09.827
- How many?
- None.

27:10.996 --> 27:12.796
Willie ray, this is goo-ood.

27:12.798 --> 27:14.932
Yeah, it really
is not that bad, huh?

27:14.934 --> 27:16.367
Oh, that's nice of you.

27:16.369 --> 27:19.203
-Hey, what are them?
-Oh, these? I love these.

27:19.205 --> 27:21.205
Willie ray, you've never
had a gummy bear before?

27:21.207 --> 27:24.274
-No!
-Oh, this is gonna
blow your mind.

27:26.678 --> 27:27.978
Those are good!

27:27.980 --> 27:30.147
Yeah! Hey, I want you
to have these.

27:30.149 --> 27:32.316
-No, really?
-Seriously. Thank you
for the pants.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.251
-I insist.
-Oh, well, thank you.

27:34.253 --> 27:35.853
-You're welcome.
-That's really nice of you.

27:35.855 --> 27:38.889
Boy, oh, boy,
I'm gonna have one, so--

27:38.891 --> 27:40.290
oh, man.

27:51.302 --> 27:53.203
He's always running late.

27:53.205 --> 27:54.838
You don't say.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.974
He's always running fake.

27:56.976 --> 27:59.343
Nice.

27:59.345 --> 28:03.747
-That's funny.
-Thank you, sir.

28:03.749 --> 28:06.784
Is there usually
a specific time he--

28:06.786 --> 28:09.687
you know, like I said,
you gonna smell it.

28:09.689 --> 28:11.321
You're gonna start
to smell it.

28:11.323 --> 28:12.790
Maybe we should
open the windows.

28:12.792 --> 28:14.958
That was a waste
of a night.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.260
Yeah.

28:16.262 --> 28:18.729
Well, he might have said
Wednesday at 8:00.

28:18.731 --> 28:21.999
- No can, thank you.
-  -Thanks for the pants, Willie ray!

28:22.001 --> 28:24.802
- Oh, yeah, have fun.
-  -Jesus.

28:24.804 --> 28:26.136
Hey, Jamie,
where are we going today?

28:26.138 --> 28:27.805
-Georgia tech.
-Oh, yeah.

28:27.807 --> 28:29.807
- Unless.
-  -Unless we go home now.

28:29.809 --> 28:32.242
-You're the boss.
-Guys, I really wanna
find the beast.

28:32.244 --> 28:34.078
- Ooh, me too!
- Oh, shoot me now.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.746
Mickey, I love your spirit.

28:35.748 --> 28:37.181
And moose, what else
do you have to do?

28:37.183 --> 28:39.483
Uh, well, I,
what's the point?

28:39.485 --> 28:41.118
Steve, look, I can't.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.386
I called your boss
and he's cool.

28:42.388 --> 28:43.454
You have the next
three weeks off.

28:43.456 --> 28:46.223
-What?
-Guys, come on!

28:46.225 --> 28:48.358
We could do
something epic here.

28:48.360 --> 28:49.493
I believe them.

28:49.495 --> 28:50.994
They've seen bigfoot,

28:50.996 --> 28:52.029
so why can't we?

28:52.031 --> 28:53.430
Steve, I don't know.

28:53.432 --> 28:55.833
Hey, I cannot wait
to find bigfoot.

28:55.835 --> 28:57.201
Yeah, well, don't keep
your hopes up, buddy.

28:57.203 --> 28:58.335
Spoiler alert.
There isn't one.

28:58.337 --> 28:59.803
You don't know that, moose.

28:59.805 --> 29:01.305
Oh, I'm sure
to goddamn sure, I do.

29:01.307 --> 29:03.373
Hey,
i think he's out there.

29:03.375 --> 29:05.109
I really do.

29:05.111 --> 29:07.344
And we might not find him,
but he's out there,

29:07.346 --> 29:09.413
- and that is a fact.
- Oh, that's a fact?

29:09.415 --> 29:12.049
I'm sorry.
What does he look like,
since you've seen him?

29:12.051 --> 29:13.751
I haven't seen him,
but other people have.

29:13.753 --> 29:15.319
20 million people
in this world

29:15.321 --> 29:17.921
and they never
have a camera ready?
Interesting.

29:17.923 --> 29:20.491
There are more than 20 million
people in this world, moron.

29:20.493 --> 29:23.127
-Good.
-There's plenty
of pictures.

29:23.129 --> 29:27.998
-You saw one.
-Bigfoot doesn't go whitewater
rafting, Mickey, come on!

29:28.000 --> 29:30.501
-How do you know, moose?
-Oh, okay, well,
here's a picture

29:30.503 --> 29:33.137
I just found of Neil Armstrong
and bigfoot together
on the moon.

29:33.139 --> 29:35.506
Oh, here he is
with tennis great,
martina navratilova.

29:35.508 --> 29:37.341
There is no bigfoot!

29:37.343 --> 29:39.276
Oh, yeah, you willing to put
a little money on that, moose?

29:39.278 --> 29:40.778
-Steve.
-Oh, it's getting real, guys.

29:40.780 --> 29:42.946
No, no, no, hear me out.
If you guys decide

29:42.948 --> 29:45.949
to really investigate
with me for the next two weeks,

29:45.951 --> 29:48.519
and we don't find bigfoot,

29:48.521 --> 29:52.356
then I am willing
to give you all $1,000.

29:52.358 --> 29:53.857
Each?

29:53.859 --> 29:55.225
Yeah, each.

29:55.227 --> 29:56.927
You don't even have
half that money, Steve.

29:56.929 --> 29:58.095
That's about all
the money I have.

29:58.097 --> 29:59.863
I'm in.

29:59.865 --> 30:02.132
We are going to find him,
Mickey.

30:02.134 --> 30:04.168
Oh, this is gonna be great.

30:04.170 --> 30:05.269
-Jamie.
-No.

30:05.271 --> 30:06.537
-I need you.
-No, no.

30:06.539 --> 30:08.038
I don't think I can
do this without you.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.439
-I don't think I can.
-Steve.

30:09.441 --> 30:11.909
What do you say? Please?
It'll be fun, I promise you.

30:11.911 --> 30:13.143
-Oh.
-I swear.

30:14.312 --> 30:15.479
Oh.

30:18.516 --> 30:20.350
-Do not make me
regret this.
-Yes!

30:20.352 --> 30:23.887
Okay? All right,
my god, you owe me.

30:23.889 --> 30:25.255
I will owe you
everything you want.

30:25.257 --> 30:27.524
-You owe me big.
-Moose, what do you say?

30:27.526 --> 30:29.193
You don't wanna let
the team down, do you?

30:29.195 --> 30:30.594
- Two weeks?
- Two weeks.

30:30.596 --> 30:32.162
Or until we find him.
Whichever comes first.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.464
-Two weeks and $1,000?
-$1,000.

30:34.466 --> 30:36.867
1,000 clams,
cheddar with bacon.

30:36.869 --> 30:38.335
A hundred thousand pennies.

30:38.337 --> 30:41.605
Lot of Benjamins coming
your way, in your wallet,

30:41.607 --> 30:43.307
read 'em and weep.
Or don't cry.

30:43.309 --> 30:46.210
Whatever you wanna do.
Just 1,000 big gold--

30:46.212 --> 30:47.544
$1,000, Steve?
That's what you were
talking about?

30:47.546 --> 30:48.579
- That's fine.
- You're on.

30:48.581 --> 30:50.013
I have it.

30:50.015 --> 30:52.916
Okay. This won't be
that bad, right?

30:52.918 --> 30:57.020
Are you kidding me?
This is going to be
the time of our lives.

30:57.022 --> 30:58.555
You better pay up.

30:58.557 --> 30:59.923
I'm a man of my word.

30:59.925 --> 31:02.359
Sign here.
And here.

31:02.361 --> 31:03.894
Where did you get
these contracts so fast?

31:03.896 --> 31:05.462
Oh, it doesn't matter.

31:05.464 --> 31:06.930
I feel like I should
read this first.

31:06.932 --> 31:08.498
Nope. Sign here.

31:17.942 --> 31:21.578
Mickey, make sure
you come to dinner.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.413
Hey, that's a grandma thing.

31:23.415 --> 31:24.581
No.

31:34.125 --> 31:36.927
Jeez, a little help
would be nice here.

31:40.199 --> 31:41.965
-This is right for you.
-Shut up.

31:41.967 --> 31:43.367
-Yeah.
-Enjoy yourself.

31:48.506 --> 31:51.174
I need your clothes,
your boots,

31:51.176 --> 31:53.977
and your motorcycle.

31:53.979 --> 31:55.379
-"Terminator 2", man.
-Dude, yeah.

31:55.381 --> 31:57.614
I was just quiet
because it was shocking.

31:57.616 --> 32:00.484
-How good it was, man.
-You give it a try.

32:02.687 --> 32:04.621
There we got the rope,
and the two bags here,

32:04.623 --> 32:07.124
the two bags down here,
the sleeping bag,

32:07.126 --> 32:08.558
two sleeping bags.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.029
I need you clothes,
your boots,

32:12.031 --> 32:15.599
and your motorcycle.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.100
I'm supposed to be
Christopher walken.

32:17.102 --> 32:18.368
-What's the damage?
-And the rifle.

32:18.370 --> 32:20.604
No, no, no,
nope, no rifle.

32:20.606 --> 32:22.005
No rifle.

32:22.007 --> 32:24.608
Help me.
Help, I'm caught.

32:24.610 --> 32:27.544
Oh, look, I caught
the cutest butterfly ever.

32:27.546 --> 32:29.346
-Let me out.
-Okay.

32:29.348 --> 32:31.048
-I can't get it off.
-Okay.

32:32.016 --> 32:34.217
Seriously, dude.

32:34.219 --> 32:36.253
-We're looking for bigfoot.
-For bigfoot?

32:36.255 --> 32:39.022
-Yeah.
-You're probably
all gonna die.

32:42.460 --> 32:44.695
-You guys ready?
-Yes, me liege.

32:44.697 --> 32:46.196
Ready as I'll ever be.

32:46.198 --> 32:49.166
Let's get this crap over with.

32:49.168 --> 32:51.001
Let's set up
over here, huh, Jamie?

32:51.003 --> 32:51.001
Copy that.

32:53.438 --> 32:56.206
All right, here we are
in the eerie woods

32:56.208 --> 32:58.442
of calamityville, Georgia.

32:58.444 --> 33:01.178
Our official search
begins now.

33:01.180 --> 33:03.213
For two weeks it's just us

33:03.215 --> 33:05.582
and the unpredictable
wilderness.

33:05.584 --> 33:08.719
We've got our food,
our equipment, our tents,

33:08.721 --> 33:11.488
and Mickey has got the map.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.323
We will soon find out
what awaits us

33:13.325 --> 33:16.360
in this dreaded forest.

33:16.362 --> 33:21.131
Ladies and gentlemen,
project bigfoot is underway.

33:21.133 --> 33:23.133
Stay tuned.

33:23.135 --> 33:26.103
-Yeah, I don't have it.
-You lost the map!

33:26.105 --> 33:28.772
-Dude! That is so not cool.
-I am so sorry.

33:28.774 --> 33:30.440
We haven't even gotten
into the wilderness yet,

33:30.442 --> 33:33.543
-and you lost the map?
-I know, I'm really sorry.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.645
Do we even need a map?
I mean, how big are the woods?

33:35.647 --> 33:38.682
Uh, 24.6 square miles.
That's how big, moose!

33:38.684 --> 33:40.650
- Idiot.
 -All right, everyone just relax.

33:40.652 --> 33:43.553
We're gonna go into town
and we'll buy a new map.

33:43.555 --> 33:45.188
-Problem solved, Steve.
-Oh, problem solved, Steve.

33:45.190 --> 33:46.690
Problem solved?

33:46.692 --> 33:49.659
Mickey, I highlighted
and organized the entire thing.

33:49.661 --> 33:52.763
I outlined the most time
efficient routes we should take.

33:52.765 --> 33:55.298
I detailed the terrain,
i drew up hot spots.

33:55.300 --> 33:58.135
I constructed an entire...

34:02.040 --> 34:05.642
Ah, look at him.
He's like a lost little boy

34:05.644 --> 34:07.310
running to his mama.

34:08.279 --> 34:10.380
All right, first things first.

34:10.382 --> 34:12.349
Be on the lookout
for any footprints,

34:12.351 --> 34:14.784
unusual hairs,
or droppings.

34:14.786 --> 34:17.087
- What?
- He means poop.

34:17.089 --> 34:19.056
-Right, Steve?
-That's right.

34:19.058 --> 34:21.123
It has been said
that bigfoot has a red tint

34:21.126 --> 34:22.692
to his incredibly
large feces.

34:22.694 --> 34:24.094
Gross.

34:24.096 --> 34:26.797
Stay on the lookout,
be sharp.

34:26.799 --> 34:30.400
This is the start of what
will be a life-changing event.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.235
- Sorry, bud.
- Watch out, Mickey.

34:33.771 --> 34:36.739
You lost the camera?
Dude, that is so not cool.

34:36.742 --> 34:38.475
I am so sorry, Steve.

34:38.476 --> 34:39.775
How am I supposed
to do a documentary

34:39.777 --> 34:41.645
without a camera?
Oh, I know, Mickey,

34:41.647 --> 34:43.080
I'll just tell people
it happened.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.281
You're a great storyteller.

34:44.283 --> 34:46.149
- Sure.
- No, he's not.

34:46.150 --> 34:48.085
Oh, wait, here it is, guys.
I found the camera.

34:48.087 --> 34:50.320
- Oh, man, total thank you.
 -Crisis averted.

34:50.322 --> 34:52.255
Actually, it's gonna start
getting dark pretty soon,

34:52.257 --> 34:54.091
-so we should probably
set up camp.
-Oh, yeah.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.393
And this is very
important guys,

34:56.395 --> 34:58.595
I want one camera
rolling at all times.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.363
You never know when
he may appear. Agreed?

35:00.365 --> 35:02.299
-No, it's not gonna happen.
-Totally.

35:02.301 --> 35:03.800
Moose, you know how
to set up a tent?

35:03.802 --> 35:07.304
I think I can handle it,
sweetheart.

35:07.306 --> 35:10.107
Okay, that-- great,
you go and do that,

35:10.109 --> 35:12.742
and Mickey, you go get
some firewood, all right?

35:12.744 --> 35:14.744
Steve and I, we're gonna
finish unpacking, yeah?

35:14.746 --> 35:17.280
-Moose, you help me,
i help you?
-Okay, cool.

35:17.282 --> 35:20.484
Okay, um, firewood's
the same as real wood, right?

35:20.486 --> 35:23.687
-You're kidding, right?
-Yeah.

35:23.689 --> 35:26.756
Okay, and then it should
just snap into place.

35:26.758 --> 35:28.158
-Oh.
-Got it?

35:28.160 --> 35:29.493
Yeah, got it.

35:29.495 --> 35:31.361
Do you think you can
handle that, sweetheart?

35:31.363 --> 35:33.163
Good one.

35:34.298 --> 35:35.565
All right,
where's the other one?

35:35.567 --> 35:36.800
The other what?

35:36.802 --> 35:38.168
The other tent.

35:38.170 --> 35:39.336
Oh, no, no, no.
This should be fine.

35:39.338 --> 35:40.804
It says it sleeps four.

35:44.208 --> 35:46.209
Thank you for coming, Jamie.

35:46.211 --> 35:48.411
I owe you big.

35:48.413 --> 35:50.313
You know, I could
do a lot with $1,000.

35:50.315 --> 35:51.915
Yeah, where are you
gonna get $1,000?

35:51.917 --> 35:53.416
Oh, very funny.

35:53.418 --> 35:55.785
Moose, what would
you do with $1,000?

35:55.787 --> 35:58.822
Start my own production
company.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.624
Set up a meeting
with m. Knight,

36:00.626 --> 36:01.825
-and then--
-wow.

36:05.696 --> 36:07.864
They're on our tail!

36:09.433 --> 36:11.434
I'll get you blood brotherz!

36:15.439 --> 36:17.174
Come on,
little brother, let's go!

36:17.176 --> 36:19.776
I found an abandoned house.
Let's hide!

36:24.749 --> 36:27.184
That place is perfect.

36:33.424 --> 36:35.725
Thanks, big bro,

36:35.727 --> 36:37.194
blood brotherz for life.

36:37.196 --> 36:40.397
Yeah, man.
Blood brotherz for life.

36:40.399 --> 36:41.731
Wow, the guard!

36:41.733 --> 36:43.533
He's found our hideout.

36:43.535 --> 36:44.834
Run!

36:46.904 --> 36:49.639
So this is where we decided
to set up camp for the night.

36:50.708 --> 36:51.775
And this is our fire.

36:51.777 --> 36:53.443
Hot set, everybody, hot set.

36:53.445 --> 36:55.345
I am on fire.

36:55.347 --> 36:56.780
This is our luxurious tent,

36:56.782 --> 36:58.748
which is almost
like sleeping in a hotel.

36:58.750 --> 37:01.685
And here is the amazing Jamie
reading a book.

37:01.687 --> 37:03.820
Oh, Jamie, do you
have anything to say

37:03.822 --> 37:05.755
about our first day
on the hunt?

37:05.757 --> 37:07.224
I can't believe
I'm really doing this.

37:07.226 --> 37:08.391
Great, well said.

37:08.393 --> 37:10.293
This is the rest
of our camp that--

37:10.295 --> 37:11.962
- why are we not taking care of our maps?
-  -Psst, Steve.

37:11.964 --> 37:13.530
Oh, and there's
Mickey and moose

37:13.532 --> 37:15.232
in a tree for some reason.
What is it?

37:15.234 --> 37:16.866
Okay, so, moose thinks
he's got a better shot

37:16.868 --> 37:19.369
of getting with Jamie
than I do, but I disagree.

37:19.371 --> 37:21.338
- I could totally bang her if I wanted to.
-  -Oh.

37:21.340 --> 37:22.939
He's got the confidence,
but I got the charm.

37:22.941 --> 37:24.674
I mean, what do you think?

37:24.676 --> 37:27.344
I think we have a duty
as gentlemen to--

37:27.346 --> 37:29.279
Doodie, right?
Oh, yeah, of course.

37:29.281 --> 37:30.814
Really? That's exactly
what I was gonna say.

37:30.816 --> 37:32.649
We have a-- we have
an obligation.

37:32.651 --> 37:34.551
-Obligation.
-That's not as funny.

37:34.553 --> 37:38.288
As professionals to keep this
on the level, okay?

37:38.290 --> 37:40.690
- There is a lady in our midst.
Where are you going?
- Good point.

37:40.692 --> 37:43.326
Moose, ugh, god.

37:50.701 --> 37:54.804
-Do you like what you see?
-Get away from me.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.973
Your loss.

37:56.975 --> 38:00.543
-Oh, man.
-Dude, I don't even
feel like I should go.

38:00.545 --> 38:02.679
Get out there, dude,
get out there. Go.

38:02.681 --> 38:05.682
- You guys didn't plan this very well, did you?
-  -No.

38:05.684 --> 38:08.518
Hey, Jamie, apparently
there's this rabid bear

38:08.520 --> 38:10.353
running through the woods
just killing people.

38:10.355 --> 38:12.322
They found a kid's
head and guts,

38:12.324 --> 38:14.891
and basically, honestly,
i wouldn't hold it against you

38:14.893 --> 38:16.693
if you wanna sleep
in my sleeping bag.

38:16.695 --> 38:18.328
-No.
-Okay.

38:21.799 --> 38:23.433
-What are you reading?
-Go away, you little shit.

38:23.435 --> 38:26.436
Mm, yeah, got ya,
heard you.

38:26.438 --> 38:28.905
- Oh, that was painful, dude.
 -Yeah, man.

38:28.907 --> 38:30.940
That's gonna be
a tough nut to crack, huh?

38:30.942 --> 38:33.777
-Well, she can crack my nuts.
-He's so good at this.

38:33.779 --> 38:35.578
Yeah, that's wonderful.
I'm going to sleep, guys.

38:35.580 --> 38:37.647
I think you should
do the same.

38:37.649 --> 38:40.650
Get some rest.
We're gonna have a long day
ahead of us tomorrow.

38:41.752 --> 38:43.720
Day three
is officially complete.

38:43.722 --> 38:46.589
Our first official day
in the search for bigfoot

38:46.591 --> 38:48.425
is in the books.

38:48.427 --> 38:51.628
I look forward to tomorrow.
I'm captain Steve signing off.

38:51.630 --> 38:54.331
- Stay tuned.
-  -Quit calling yourself captain Steve.

38:54.333 --> 38:55.598
All right.

38:58.736 --> 39:01.671
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.406
Oh, you made breakfast!

39:03.408 --> 39:05.375
-Yup. Bacon and eggs.
-Nice.

39:05.377 --> 39:07.577
-Hey, Steve, Jamie
made breakfast.
-Yeah, I know.

39:07.579 --> 39:08.645
She's amazing.

39:08.647 --> 39:09.913
I didn't buy
bacon and eggs.

39:09.915 --> 39:11.748
Uh, you didn't. I did.

39:11.750 --> 39:13.650
All you bought
were twinkies and ice pops.

39:13.652 --> 39:14.951
That's for drinking water now.

39:14.953 --> 39:16.886
Whatever, just eat
your breakfast.

39:16.888 --> 39:18.822
-I think I'm in love.
-What?

39:18.824 --> 39:21.691
Uh, you-- you fit
like a glove.

39:23.994 --> 39:26.596
-Egg me.
-You know we have plates.

39:26.598 --> 39:27.731
Oh, I don't need
to be fancy.

39:27.733 --> 39:29.766
-Is this Turkey bacon?
-Yes.

39:37.408 --> 39:40.443
Wild audio recordings
day four.

39:40.445 --> 39:42.946
Location 82.24 degrees
latitude,

39:42.948 --> 39:45.515
34.16 degrees
longitude.

39:45.517 --> 39:48.651
Time is approximately...

39:48.653 --> 39:51.654
2:39 pm eastern standard time.

39:51.656 --> 39:54.591
Temperature is 74 degrees
fahrenheit.

39:54.593 --> 39:58.027
There's a current breeze
of two to three inches moving--

39:58.029 --> 39:59.696
that is a lot
of information, Steve.

39:59.698 --> 40:01.164
That is a lot of information.

40:01.166 --> 40:02.899
I was just thinking that
as I was saying the Wes--

40:02.901 --> 40:05.735
what was that?

40:05.737 --> 40:07.837
Shh. What was that?

40:09.440 --> 40:11.040
Did you guys hear that?

40:12.076 --> 40:13.977
I think I farted, Steve.

40:15.079 --> 40:17.080
Yeah, yeah, you did.

40:17.082 --> 40:20.784
Let's move out!
Get away from the smell.

40:22.086 --> 40:23.920
Hey, Jamie.

40:25.122 --> 40:27.690
-Hey, Jamie!
-What, moose?

40:27.692 --> 40:29.893
Do you have a boyfriend?

40:29.895 --> 40:34.931
-Wow, uh, no, I do not.
-Really? That's cool, man.

40:34.933 --> 40:37.534
Hey, how about you and me
go behind that tree over there

40:37.536 --> 40:39.636
-and we bang?
-How about you go
kill yourself?

40:39.638 --> 40:44.007
Oh-ho. How about we go behind
that tree, we bang,

40:44.009 --> 40:46.910
-and then I kill myself?
-Yeah, I'll think about it.

40:46.912 --> 40:49.446
Nice. Progress.

40:50.648 --> 40:54.050
-Moose! I got wood.
-So do I.

40:54.052 --> 40:56.853
- All right, the campsite
looks pretty good for now.

40:56.855 --> 40:58.087
We'll move west tomorrow.

40:58.089 --> 40:59.489
Hey, let's have
some drinks tonight.

40:59.491 --> 41:01.191
-Yeah!
-I don't know, guys.

41:01.193 --> 41:03.092
-I don't think that's
such a good idea.
-Yeah.

41:03.094 --> 41:05.061
I could really use a drink.
I think you could too,
there, captain.

41:05.063 --> 41:07.997
Come on, stevesy.
Steve, Steve.

41:07.999 --> 41:10.733
Steve! Steve! Steve!

41:10.735 --> 41:13.937
All right, all right, all right,
let's have some beers.

41:13.939 --> 41:15.505
Whoo!

41:16.674 --> 41:19.976
-You forgot all of it?
-Everything.

41:19.978 --> 41:22.745
It's probably for the best.

41:22.747 --> 41:24.848
-I'm going hunting.
-Sweet.

41:24.850 --> 41:26.583
-All right, but be back
before it gets dark.
-No.

41:26.585 --> 41:28.485
And take the b cam in case
you come across anything.

41:28.487 --> 41:29.486
Yeah, like beer.

41:29.488 --> 41:32.856
Oh, burn! Wow!

41:32.858 --> 41:34.824
Jamie, you wanna go
look over this map again?

41:34.826 --> 41:36.593
Sure.

41:36.595 --> 41:38.695
I'm telling you, moose,
it was right over there.

41:38.697 --> 41:40.697
I didn't see a thing.

41:40.699 --> 41:42.265
Why can't I get
this thing to focus?

41:42.267 --> 41:43.766
We need to get
our money back.

41:43.768 --> 41:45.168
You do not know
how to use a camera.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.136
Yeah, I do.
Look at this.

41:47.138 --> 41:49.906
- Zoom.
- Why are you saying zoom?

41:49.908 --> 41:52.108
Oh, my god! It's right there!
Did you not see that?

41:52.110 --> 41:54.544
No, I didn't.
I'm going back to camp.

41:54.546 --> 41:55.645
Wait for me.

41:59.250 --> 42:01.818
-Ah, damn it!
-Do you smell something?

42:01.820 --> 42:04.220
- No!
-  -Nothing out of the ordinary.

42:04.222 --> 42:05.989
-Kinda.
-Yes!

42:05.991 --> 42:07.857
-You smell something,
don't you?
-Ah...

42:07.859 --> 42:09.058
Tell me what it is, Mickey.

42:09.060 --> 42:10.527
-Ah...
-Tell me!

42:10.529 --> 42:11.828
Pizza?

42:13.264 --> 42:15.064
You smell pizza?

42:15.066 --> 42:18.234
Yeah, kinda,
but with pepperoni.

42:18.236 --> 42:23.072
How do you smell pizza
out here in the middle
of the woods?

42:23.074 --> 42:24.674
I...

42:24.676 --> 42:26.910
He smells pizza.

42:28.712 --> 42:30.313
I thought I smelled
pizza, Jamie.

42:30.315 --> 42:31.881
I know you did.

42:31.883 --> 42:34.918
Oh, and Willie Ray's stew,
as well.

42:36.220 --> 42:38.555
It's still in your mustache.

42:40.291 --> 42:42.625
I'll be damned,
it's still in my mustache.

42:42.627 --> 42:43.960
Hey, Steve, false alarm!

42:43.962 --> 42:46.095
It was my mustache
the whole time, bud.

42:46.097 --> 42:48.097
So the brother
comes back to life.

42:48.099 --> 42:49.832
- He comes back?
- Yeah, he's back?

42:49.834 --> 42:51.834
- I thought he was dead.
- Yeah, no, he's not.

42:51.836 --> 42:53.703
-He's a cyborg.
-No way.

42:53.705 --> 42:55.738
I mean, this stuff
just comes to me.

42:55.740 --> 42:58.274
And then it's off
in the future,

42:58.276 --> 42:59.909
and, like, they're after
the security guard,

42:59.911 --> 43:01.878
but they realize
he's not a security guard,

43:01.880 --> 43:04.681
-he's just from the future.
-Don't go all Hollywood on us.

43:04.683 --> 43:05.949
Hey, what if I end up being,
like,

43:05.951 --> 43:08.885
your adopted brother in it?

43:08.887 --> 43:10.653
And then what happens is...

43:12.022 --> 43:15.091
Okay, whenever
you're ready, Steve.

43:15.093 --> 43:17.727
Day 10, the hunt continues.

43:17.729 --> 43:19.362
-Though I think
we've been close--
-stop it!

43:19.364 --> 43:23.733
-It was moose.
-God, you creeps.

43:23.735 --> 43:25.835
-Are we finished?
-Jesus.

43:25.837 --> 43:27.337
-Action!
-No, Mickey.

43:27.339 --> 43:29.973
-See, that's either Jamie--
-and action!

43:29.975 --> 43:32.709
Day 10, the hunt continues.

43:32.711 --> 43:34.110
Though I think
we've been close,

43:34.112 --> 43:35.979
we have yet to produce
any kind of evidence,

43:35.981 --> 43:38.047
so we continue to march on.

43:38.049 --> 43:40.617
Now nobody said
this was going to be easy,

43:40.619 --> 43:43.319
but we still have
one week left.

43:43.321 --> 43:46.789
We're constantly surrounded
by odd smells and sounds

43:46.791 --> 43:50.660
that could very easily belong
to the elusive creature.

43:50.662 --> 43:53.396
We've covered
about five square miles,

43:53.398 --> 43:56.065
and unfortunately, thus far,
the findings have been scarce.

43:56.067 --> 43:57.700
We don't have any findings.

43:57.702 --> 44:00.136
My relentless team and i
will continue this pursuit

44:00.138 --> 44:02.138
until its end.

44:02.140 --> 44:05.341
We will not rest until
our mission is complete.

44:05.343 --> 44:10.279
For moose, Jamie, and Mickey,
I'm captain Steve signing off.

44:11.882 --> 44:13.816
Stay tuned.

44:15.352 --> 44:17.120
And cut.

44:17.122 --> 44:19.055
-We'll just have
your cousin cut there.
-Yeah, he's good.

44:19.057 --> 44:21.958
-All right, check the gate!
-God, my ear.

44:21.960 --> 44:23.192
It's not your job.

44:25.396 --> 44:28.831
Whoa, wow, okay,
that's a-- that's a toughie.

44:28.833 --> 44:32.669
Um, what is that? Right?

44:32.671 --> 44:35.705
Uh... I think
Shakespeare put it best,

44:35.707 --> 44:39.308
when he said that love,
called by any other name,

44:39.310 --> 44:41.244
-is still a rose.
-Yeah, that's--

44:41.246 --> 44:42.412
that's definitely not right.

44:42.414 --> 44:44.147
Yeah, it's something
like that.

44:44.149 --> 44:46.749
-No, not at all.
-I've never read it.

44:46.751 --> 44:47.817
What about you, moose?

44:47.819 --> 44:49.052
You ever been in love?

44:49.054 --> 44:50.987
Thank you for asking.

44:52.356 --> 44:55.391
Yeah, yeah, once, huh.

44:55.393 --> 44:57.060
Oh, man, I remember
the first time

44:57.062 --> 44:58.327
I sat next to her
on the bus.

44:58.329 --> 45:00.396
I knew I was in love.

45:00.398 --> 45:03.366
Oh, we were together
all the time, me and her.

45:03.368 --> 45:07.136
She was that kinda girl
that just understood me,
you know?

45:07.138 --> 45:10.206
My gosh, that's so sweet?
What happened?

45:10.208 --> 45:13.076
Well, we got older,
and she went and did
her own thing

45:13.078 --> 45:15.912
and I went my own way,
played college football,

45:15.914 --> 45:17.346
and I was in the army
for a little while.

45:17.348 --> 45:19.282
-The army?
-Yeah, yeah.

45:19.284 --> 45:21.317
-Oh, god, really?
-Yeah.

45:21.319 --> 45:24.253
A lot of stuff
went down there.

45:24.255 --> 45:26.956
But not a day went by...

45:26.958 --> 45:29.425
That I didn't think
about her.

45:29.427 --> 45:31.127
It made me live.

45:32.830 --> 45:37.400
And afterwards I went home
and she wasn't there,

45:37.402 --> 45:39.102
but I waited for her.

45:40.270 --> 45:43.072
I waited for her every day.

45:43.074 --> 45:45.108
I even heard whispers
of knocks on the door

45:45.110 --> 45:48.244
until one day it was real.

45:48.246 --> 45:50.747
And I ran down
as fast as I could,

45:50.749 --> 45:52.849
and I opened it,
and there she was.

45:54.785 --> 45:56.753
And then she told me
she was sick.

45:56.755 --> 45:58.387
Oh, my god.

45:58.389 --> 46:01.524
And that she wanted
to get married.

46:01.526 --> 46:03.793
- I knew at that point.
- "Forrest Gump"!

46:03.795 --> 46:05.762
Wait, what?

46:05.764 --> 46:09.365
Yeah, that's "Forrest Gump,"
none of that is true.

46:09.367 --> 46:11.234
What?

46:11.236 --> 46:13.069
-Really, moose?
-No, don't judge me.

46:13.071 --> 46:15.004
- Oh, my god.
- I'm going to sleep.

46:15.006 --> 46:17.907
Really moose?
That's so funny.

46:17.909 --> 46:19.876
I think that's a great idea.
I think we should go to bed.

46:19.878 --> 46:22.311
I think it's a good idea
if you just stop talking.

46:22.313 --> 46:25.047
All right?
It's ridiculous.

46:27.050 --> 46:28.851
Jamie,

46:30.288 --> 46:33.556
You shot me in the buttocks,
lieutenant Jamie.

46:35.026 --> 46:37.794
I see what we did.

46:37.796 --> 46:39.295
I might not be a smart man,

46:39.297 --> 46:40.897
but I know a box of chocolates
when I see--

46:40.899 --> 46:42.465
No, that's not even close.

46:42.467 --> 46:44.433
That's not a quote of dialogue
from that movie.

46:48.373 --> 46:51.307
Guys! Guys, wake up!

46:51.309 --> 46:53.142
Oh, this better
be good, Steve.

46:53.144 --> 46:54.310
- What?
- Ow!

46:54.312 --> 46:56.579
Listen. He moans.

46:56.581 --> 46:58.214
What moans?

46:58.216 --> 47:00.283
Oh, shit, that's him.

47:00.285 --> 47:02.218
-Oh, wow.
-Oh, give me a break.

47:02.220 --> 47:03.853
-You don't hear that, moose?
-No.

47:05.423 --> 47:06.455
-You getting that?
-Oh, yeah,

47:06.457 --> 47:08.224
he's howling all right.

47:08.226 --> 47:10.059
So, bigfoot's the only thing
that howls in this forest.

47:10.061 --> 47:11.460
Moose, that is the howl,
of the very beast

47:11.462 --> 47:13.596
we're looking for.

47:13.598 --> 47:15.031
Mickey, stop pointing
that thing in my face

47:15.033 --> 47:16.165
every time
you hear a noise.

47:16.167 --> 47:17.300
- I'm sorry!
- Shh.

47:17.302 --> 47:18.334
This is stupid.

47:18.336 --> 47:20.136
Shh.

47:20.138 --> 47:21.571
What are you, librarians?

47:21.573 --> 47:24.607
- That is
definitely him.

47:24.609 --> 47:27.043
There's absolutely
no way that could be bigfoot.

47:27.045 --> 47:28.344
I'm bigfoot.

47:28.346 --> 47:29.946
- Oh, oh, come on!
- That's him!

47:29.948 --> 47:31.047
- That's bigfoot!
- That's ridiculous.

47:31.049 --> 47:32.415
I'm getting out of here!

47:32.417 --> 47:33.883
-Please, no, Steve.
-Let me out of here.

47:33.885 --> 47:35.384
I wish to see him
with my own eyes!

47:35.386 --> 47:37.019
- No, it's not safe.
- We've come this far!

47:37.021 --> 47:38.354
- It's ridiculous.
- I can't leave!

47:40.157 --> 47:42.225
- Get off of me.
- Shut up.

47:44.061 --> 47:45.995
Unless something
unzips this tent,

47:45.997 --> 47:47.597
y'all better not wake me up.

47:47.599 --> 47:49.065
Good night.

47:49.067 --> 47:51.000
He can't get in here,
Steve, can he?

47:51.002 --> 47:53.102
Yeah, probably,
if he wants to get in,
he can get in.

47:53.104 --> 47:55.605
Mickey, it's very,
very unlikely, okay?

47:55.607 --> 47:57.874
Yeah, it's probably unlikely,
just listen to Jamie.

47:57.876 --> 47:59.075
Just in case, Jamie,
can I sleep

47:59.077 --> 48:00.076
-in your sleeping bag?
-No.

48:00.078 --> 48:01.911
- Okay.
- Wow.

48:03.480 --> 48:06.315
Oh, that was exciting.

48:06.317 --> 48:09.118
How can you guys
get back to sleep?

48:09.120 --> 48:10.386
I'm gonna leave
this camera on

48:10.388 --> 48:12.355
just in case it catches
any more audio.

48:13.290 --> 48:15.324
Shh.

48:15.326 --> 48:17.159
Stop it, Mickey!

48:17.161 --> 48:20.096
Sorry, I get restless
hands syndrome.

48:20.098 --> 48:22.365
I left all
my medicine at home.

48:26.670 --> 48:28.504
- Jamie.
- Jamie.

48:32.442 --> 48:34.143
He's here.

48:34.145 --> 48:36.045
I know he's here.

48:36.047 --> 48:37.546
Stalking us.
Taunting us.

48:37.548 --> 48:40.583
Toying with us.

48:40.585 --> 48:43.052
The very hairs
on the back of my neck
are always at attention

48:43.054 --> 48:45.554
because I know
at any given second
he can show himself.

48:48.025 --> 48:49.625
I have to be ready.

48:49.627 --> 48:51.928
I've been waiting
for this life-changing moment

48:51.930 --> 48:53.496
- for as long as
i can remember.

48:53.498 --> 48:55.364
Oh, what was that?

48:55.366 --> 48:56.966
Show yourself!

48:56.968 --> 48:59.101
I'm here!
I'm ready!

48:59.103 --> 49:00.636
Show yourself, you monster!

49:00.638 --> 49:03.172
You beast!
Oh, oh! Jamie!

49:03.174 --> 49:04.941
-Hi, Steve!
-Hi.

49:04.943 --> 49:06.676
What are you doing
out here on your own?

49:06.678 --> 49:08.411
- You know the rules?
- Of course I know the rules.

49:08.413 --> 49:10.212
I made them up.

49:10.214 --> 49:12.982
I was just trying
for a stealth-like approach,
that's all.

49:12.984 --> 49:15.518
Oh, any luck?

49:17.387 --> 49:20.523
Luck has nothing
to do with it, Jamie.

49:20.525 --> 49:24.026
Luck is chance.
A wish or a hope

49:24.028 --> 49:27.296
based on some imminent
sense of defeat.

49:27.298 --> 49:29.298
That's not what this is.

49:29.300 --> 49:34.170
This is fate.
We are here for a reason.

49:34.172 --> 49:36.138
Destiny.
We are destined to be here.

49:36.140 --> 49:37.974
To find him.

49:37.976 --> 49:41.177
Luck is a maybe, and we are
definitely going to find him.

49:41.179 --> 49:43.412
Do you understand?

49:43.414 --> 49:45.514
Uh, yes?

49:46.683 --> 49:48.384
Good.

49:48.386 --> 49:50.286
Come on! Let's go rally
the troops.

49:53.457 --> 49:55.224
- Are we rolling?
- Yup, why?

49:55.226 --> 49:57.326
-What are you gonna do?
-I'm gonna do what Steve does.

49:57.328 --> 50:00.296
Talk and stuff.
Numbers, equations, facts.

50:00.298 --> 50:01.630
Why would you do that?
You're bad at it.

50:01.632 --> 50:04.533
Oh, yeah?
How's this for bad?

50:04.535 --> 50:08.004
We're at latitude 10-6 Harvard.

50:08.006 --> 50:11.674
It is cloudy, fog.
Footprint taste... muddy.

50:11.676 --> 50:13.609
All right, all I'm saying,
and you're proving it right now,

50:13.611 --> 50:15.711
is that you're really
bad at this.

50:15.713 --> 50:18.748
Okay, all I'm saying
is you don't have to say
how you feel all the time,

50:18.750 --> 50:20.249
'cause it hurts peoples'
feelings sometimes.

50:20.251 --> 50:21.717
-What are you guys doing?
-Oh, man.

50:21.719 --> 50:23.185
Mickey thinks
he found a footprint.

50:23.187 --> 50:24.587
I did find it.
Steve, you can see it.

50:24.589 --> 50:25.621
-Really?
-Yeah.

50:25.623 --> 50:27.356
What do you think?

50:27.358 --> 50:29.358
- Good work, Mickey.
- That could be anything.

50:29.360 --> 50:31.694
A footprint this large
could only belong to one thing.

50:31.696 --> 50:33.763
- A large man.
-  -You really think so, Steve?

50:33.765 --> 50:36.198
-It must be.
-Hey, I have one question.

50:36.200 --> 50:39.602
-Why is there only
one footprint?
-What do you mean?

50:39.604 --> 50:41.570
Well, every time someone
finds a big footprint,
there's only one,

50:41.572 --> 50:44.373
I mean, is there some sort
of one-legged gimp gorilla

50:44.375 --> 50:46.442
-hopping around somewhere?
-Yeah, that's a good
question, Steve.

50:46.444 --> 50:49.245
Is there a one-legged gimp
gorilla just hopping around?

50:49.247 --> 50:51.280
Don't you see, Mickey?

50:51.282 --> 50:53.616
Don't you all see
what he's doing?

50:53.618 --> 50:55.651
Hopscotch?

50:55.653 --> 50:59.321
-He's playing with us.
-Oh, my gosh, give me
my money now.

50:59.323 --> 51:03.059
There's a very good reason
very few people ever get
a glimpse.

51:03.061 --> 51:05.361
A bigfoot gets big
because he's never caught.

51:05.363 --> 51:07.663
He knows we're on the hunt.

51:07.665 --> 51:13.169
And... he knows
we know he's close.

51:13.171 --> 51:15.704
He wails, he moans.
I know he's here, but where?

51:15.706 --> 51:18.307
Goddamn it, where?

51:18.309 --> 51:20.142
The very scent
of his mangy hair

51:20.144 --> 51:22.445
will forever lie
in the nostrils I call my own.

51:22.447 --> 51:25.748
The very moan he taunts me with
will haunt me for an eternity.

51:25.750 --> 51:28.617
- I must find him, I must.
- Hey, Steve?

51:28.619 --> 51:32.288
You better check yourself
before you wreck yourself, man.

51:34.825 --> 51:36.692
I should go
get measurements.

51:41.098 --> 51:42.765
Hey, Steve, how do you come up
with those speeches, man?

51:42.767 --> 51:44.366
What speeches?

51:46.603 --> 51:48.404
-Hey, Mickey!
-Hey, Jamie.

51:48.406 --> 51:49.772
-Hey.
-Hey, you want one?

51:49.774 --> 51:51.507
-No, thanks.
-Not too mushy.

51:51.509 --> 51:53.542
No, thanks.
Hey, you ever
read "Moby dick"?

51:53.544 --> 51:55.845
What is that? No.

51:55.847 --> 51:57.813
-You know? "Moby dick"?
-What is that?

51:57.815 --> 52:02.118
-Captain ahab.
-Sounds like some sort
of a gay comic book?

52:02.120 --> 52:05.488
-The adventures
of captain dick.
-What? No, Mickey.

52:05.490 --> 52:07.756
-The white whale?
-Are you making this up
right now?

52:07.758 --> 52:09.258
Oh, my god.
Never mind.

52:09.260 --> 52:10.559
But, Jamie, we can
read it together.

52:10.561 --> 52:12.862
Hey!

52:12.864 --> 52:15.531
Yeah?
Hey, you want me to grab it?

52:15.533 --> 52:17.867
Moose, I really need
to talk to you.

52:17.869 --> 52:19.835
Oh, yeah, you wanna go
in the tent and get a little bit

52:19.837 --> 52:23.372
-more comfortable?
-Jesus, I'm surrounded
by idiots and assholes.

52:23.374 --> 52:24.907
Ooh, that would be a good
band name, right?

52:24.909 --> 52:27.743
Here to the stage,
idiots and assholes

52:27.745 --> 52:30.279
look, I need to talk to you
about Steve.

52:30.281 --> 52:32.715
Hey, Jamie, if you ever
wanna go to a concert,

52:32.717 --> 52:35.584
we can go to the old og,
the olive garden,

52:35.586 --> 52:37.319
get a little meal,
have a little bit of wine,

52:37.321 --> 52:38.888
maybe have
a midnight kiss.

52:38.890 --> 52:40.623
I'm not sure.
I don't know what's
gonna happen after that.

52:40.625 --> 52:41.690
That sounds like
a great plan.

52:41.692 --> 52:43.325
Oh, my god.
Enough! Enough!

52:43.327 --> 52:45.161
All right?
I'm so sick of you guys

52:45.163 --> 52:47.196
trying to bang me
or whatever.

52:47.198 --> 52:48.597
- It's bang.
- Jesus.

52:48.599 --> 52:50.833
It's like you've never
seen a girl before.

52:50.835 --> 52:52.501
-None as pretty as you.
-Well, you know what?

52:52.503 --> 52:54.737
I have news for you, all right?

52:54.739 --> 52:56.705
I'm gay.

52:56.707 --> 52:59.275
- What?
- Yeah.

52:59.277 --> 53:00.676
- Really?
- I'm gay.

53:00.678 --> 53:03.612
-I'm a lesbian.
-Wait, you're a gay lesbian.

53:03.614 --> 53:05.948
Oh, so that cross cancels,
so you're actually straight.

53:05.950 --> 53:07.783
-Game on.
-No, I don't--
i don't like guys.

53:07.785 --> 53:08.951
Okay? You get it?

53:08.953 --> 53:12.321
But you tickle some guys.

53:12.323 --> 53:15.257
You know what?
I really wanna punch you
in the face right now.

53:15.259 --> 53:16.926
- Bring it.
- Wow!

53:16.928 --> 53:18.661
- A lesbian.
- Full lesbian.

53:18.663 --> 53:20.296
Did not see
that one coming.

53:20.298 --> 53:22.598
- Challenge.
- Accepted.

53:22.600 --> 53:24.400
Gonna turn
this one around.

53:24.402 --> 53:26.468
- Yeah.
- Bomber.

53:26.470 --> 53:29.205
-She's not a lesbian.
-No, not at all.
What is she thinking?

53:29.207 --> 53:31.607
Hey, Jamie could you help me
out real quick ?

53:31.609 --> 53:33.609
- No, way in hell.
- Oh.

53:33.611 --> 53:37.479
Tough love. Love it.
All right! I'll do it myself.

53:37.481 --> 53:39.782
Here we go.
Set this on up.

53:39.784 --> 53:45.754
Um, heat vision off,
night vision off, excellent.

53:45.756 --> 53:47.323
Tightening, good.

53:48.825 --> 53:50.392
Here we go.

53:51.661 --> 53:53.629
Action.

53:53.631 --> 53:57.600
Hey, everybody!
This is assistant captain
Mickey over here.

53:57.602 --> 53:59.368
Soon to hopefully be
captain Mickey,

53:59.370 --> 54:00.569
and I'll tell you why.

54:00.571 --> 54:01.870
Found a footprint
the other day,

54:01.872 --> 54:04.273
yup, moving on up
in the world.

54:04.275 --> 54:05.874
Next thing you know
I'll probably have a girlfriend

54:05.876 --> 54:07.743
or something
serious like that.

54:07.745 --> 54:11.547
Yeah, the group,
we're traveling about
3.5 miles an hour.

54:11.549 --> 54:15.417
Precipitation in the clouds
is about 33%, which is good.

54:15.419 --> 54:17.686
It's above average,
and I like that.

54:17.688 --> 54:19.521
Are we gonna
bigfoot?

54:19.523 --> 54:21.357
Let me ask you something?

54:21.359 --> 54:23.826
Does this look like
the face of a man

54:23.828 --> 54:25.427
who's not gonna
find bigfoot?

54:25.429 --> 54:26.862
What do you see
when you look at this?

54:26.864 --> 54:29.031
You see determination.

54:29.033 --> 54:31.500
You see power.

54:31.502 --> 54:32.935
Maybe see a guy
who's a little hungry.

54:32.937 --> 54:34.870
We've not really had
a lot of meals lately,

54:34.872 --> 54:38.741
but, above all, you see someone
who's gonna make it happen.

54:40.477 --> 54:42.845
This is captain Mickey
signing out.

54:44.047 --> 54:45.414
Jamie, what do you think?

54:45.416 --> 54:46.615
Were you happy with that?

54:46.617 --> 54:48.550
Uh, yeah. What do you think?

54:48.552 --> 54:50.019
Yeah, it looked great.

54:50.021 --> 54:52.855
Okay, so we've got
a few more miles to cover.

54:52.857 --> 54:54.957
I just hope everyone
comes out of this alive

54:54.959 --> 54:56.492
and with their sanity.

54:56.494 --> 54:59.695
Hey, have you guys
seen my gummy bears?

54:59.697 --> 55:01.563
I had a couple of packs left.

55:01.565 --> 55:02.998
No, I haven't.

55:03.000 --> 55:06.735
Hey, moose, have you seen
my gummy bears, man?

55:06.737 --> 55:08.504
Huh?

55:08.506 --> 55:10.472
- What are you doing?
- Oh, no.

55:10.474 --> 55:12.941
Just checking out the trail.
It's all uphill, dude.

55:15.779 --> 55:19.014
You went in my bag,
and you stole this.

55:19.016 --> 55:21.583
Dude, I'll buy you some more.

55:22.752 --> 55:25.087
Mickey, Jesus, really?

55:26.423 --> 55:28.390
You don't get it, do you?

55:28.392 --> 55:30.626
No, I don't.
They're like $2 a pack.

55:30.628 --> 55:32.461
I'll get you more.

55:34.531 --> 55:37.566
I would never
do this to you, moose.

55:37.568 --> 55:39.435
Are you serious right now?

55:40.704 --> 55:42.538
I thought you
were my friend, man.

55:42.540 --> 55:44.473
I am your friend.

55:44.475 --> 55:46.675
Mick, come on, dude!

55:46.677 --> 55:48.577
Mickey!

55:48.579 --> 55:49.778
Asshole.

55:49.780 --> 55:51.480
Okay, guys,
we're going north.

55:51.482 --> 55:53.982
Let's pack up.
We're close.

55:55.919 --> 55:57.820
- Are we rolling yet?
- Always.

55:57.822 --> 56:01.623
Good. I feel like something's
gonna happen any minute.

56:01.625 --> 56:04.593
Don't stop shooting.

56:04.595 --> 56:07.796
Here they come to the stage,
idiots and assholes,

56:07.798 --> 56:10.899
-come on, Mickey!
-Shh. Be on alert.

56:10.901 --> 56:12.601
Shut up, Steve.

56:12.603 --> 56:15.871
Remember, don't stop shooting.
We're close. I can--

56:20.443 --> 56:23.679
- Uh, are those night vision binoculars?
 -No.

56:23.681 --> 56:25.714
Not at all.
I can't see anything,

56:25.716 --> 56:27.416
Okay, maybe you should
rest for a second.

56:27.418 --> 56:30.386
-Did Columbus rest, Jamie?
-Yeah, probably.

56:33.556 --> 56:35.924
Hey, Mickey,

56:35.926 --> 56:37.926
come on, man, you can't
sleep out here tonight.

56:39.596 --> 56:41.430
Dude, don't ignore me,
it's rude.

56:41.432 --> 56:43.532
Shh, maybe he's sleeping.

56:43.534 --> 56:47.669
I'm not sleeping.
I just don't talk to thieves!

56:47.671 --> 56:51.039
Uh, come on, this is ridiculous.
It's gonna be cold out tonight.

56:55.578 --> 56:57.413
Fine, look, I'll stay
out here tonight.

56:57.415 --> 56:59.815
You shouldn't have to.

56:59.817 --> 57:02.618
Did you hear me, man?
I said I'll stay out here.

57:02.620 --> 57:03.852
Good.

57:16.533 --> 57:20.836
You find your balance.
Oop, oh! I saw that coming.

57:22.539 --> 57:25.941
-Get up.
-Look, no, I don't want
a thief to help me up.

57:28.478 --> 57:32.114
-Jamie? Was that you
helping me up?
-No, that was moose.

57:32.116 --> 57:35.517
Don't touch me!

57:35.519 --> 57:39.521
Get your filthy thieving
hands off of me!

57:39.523 --> 57:40.789
They're not on you.

57:48.565 --> 57:51.033
-Jamie, is he touching me?
-No.

57:52.469 --> 57:55.871
-Do you wanna touch me?
-Good night, Mickey.

57:55.873 --> 57:57.473
Good night, Jamie.

58:03.780 --> 58:05.080
Dickhead.

58:06.015 --> 58:07.749
Here.

58:09.085 --> 58:12.721
-Thanks, Mickey.
Well, jeez.
-F you.

58:12.723 --> 58:15.123
You know, moose,
i think we all need some rest.

58:15.125 --> 58:17.059
He needs to not
be mad at me.

58:17.061 --> 58:18.927
I mean, oh, my god,
the world's gonna end

58:18.929 --> 58:20.529
because I ate a couple
of his gummy bears.

58:20.531 --> 58:21.697
You stole them!

58:21.699 --> 58:23.765
Oh, you know what?
We get it, dude.

58:25.134 --> 58:26.568
I just wanna go home.

58:26.570 --> 58:28.937
We all do.
Well, some of us.

58:28.939 --> 58:32.608
Aw, come on, you guys
aren't gonna miss this?

58:32.610 --> 58:35.811
All the fresh air,
the thrill of the hunt?

58:35.813 --> 58:40.649
Huh? Chasing after history?
This whole bonding experience?

58:40.651 --> 58:43.952
The instinct of human survival
coursing through our bodies?

58:43.954 --> 58:47.723
No. I'm not gonna miss
any of that. None of it.

58:47.725 --> 58:49.625
Fresh air, maybe.

58:49.627 --> 58:51.727
I love it right here.

58:51.729 --> 58:53.195
Nature.

58:55.666 --> 58:57.866
Living off the land.

58:57.868 --> 59:00.802
Just like life
was intended to be.

59:00.804 --> 59:02.571
This is it right here.

59:02.573 --> 59:06.608
Dude, Steve,
we had Capri suns
for lunch, man.

59:06.610 --> 59:08.277
Capri suns.

59:08.279 --> 59:10.712
Whoa! What was that?

59:10.714 --> 59:13.682
Did you hear that?

59:13.684 --> 59:16.985
Sorry, Steve.

59:16.987 --> 59:18.687
Oh, yeah, okay,
i smell that.

59:18.689 --> 59:20.656
- Good one, buddy.
- Wow.

59:20.658 --> 59:23.659
-I'm not your buddy.
-Oh, you're talking to me now.

59:23.661 --> 59:25.260
No, I'm not!

59:25.262 --> 59:28.764
Okay, well, at least we're
headed in the right direction.

59:28.766 --> 59:30.699
We still have
a couple miles left.

59:30.701 --> 59:33.302
Tomorrow morning
we'll head that way.

59:33.304 --> 59:38.006
Guys, I hope you're prepared
for what's about to happen.

59:38.008 --> 59:42.578
Our lives are totally
gonna change.

59:42.580 --> 59:44.947
The one thing
that will be synonymous

59:44.949 --> 59:47.950
with bigfoot from here on out
will be our names.

59:49.252 --> 59:52.087
I can feel it.

59:52.089 --> 59:55.090
He's close.

59:55.092 --> 59:58.694
I wouldn't be surprised
if he was right over there.

59:58.696 --> 01:00:00.295
Ah, over there somewheres.

01:00:00.297 --> 01:00:03.865
Who are you supposed to be
Michael joneses?

01:00:03.867 --> 01:00:06.702
- Over there somewheres.
- Somewheres.

01:00:06.704 --> 01:00:09.705
Those guys were nuts.

01:00:09.707 --> 01:00:12.941
Yeah, remember when that guy
tried to kill us?

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:16.778
Oh!

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:18.313
I hope that was bigfoot.

01:00:18.315 --> 01:00:19.715
No, no, it definitely
wasn't him.

01:00:19.717 --> 01:00:21.617
It didn't sound like him.

01:00:21.619 --> 01:00:24.252
- Okay,
I'm going to sleep.

01:00:24.254 --> 01:00:27.656
- Me, too.
-  -Uh, me, three, yep, let's all get in the tent.

01:00:32.762 --> 01:00:34.029
Hey, guys,
i was just thinking--

01:00:34.031 --> 01:00:35.631
Hey! Don't let him in here!

01:00:35.633 --> 01:00:37.633
Come on, Mickey,
it's gonna be cold out,

01:00:37.635 --> 01:00:39.101
like sub zero temperature.

01:00:39.103 --> 01:00:40.702
Sorry, moose,
maybe next time

01:00:40.704 --> 01:00:42.237
you'll keep
your grubby paws
to yourself.

01:00:42.239 --> 01:00:46.274
- Grubby?
-  -You'll be okay, probably.

01:00:46.276 --> 01:00:49.778
Hey, Jamie, grubby paws,
that was a good one.

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:50.879
Thanks, Mickey.

01:00:50.881 --> 01:00:52.648
All right, lights out.

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:57.019
Dude, I think I heard
something out here.

01:00:57.021 --> 01:01:00.889
- Oh, it was nothing.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:01:00.891 --> 01:01:03.725
Good night everybody
in the tent.

01:01:06.429 --> 01:01:08.363
Good night, dudes and dudette.

01:01:10.233 --> 01:01:13.902
It's so nice out here
because of the nice
gentle breeze.

01:01:13.904 --> 01:01:16.738
- It's like a blanket.
- Reel 'em in.

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:20.342
Oh, dude, a night rainbow.

01:01:20.344 --> 01:01:23.211
Oh, there's a total
night rainbow out here.

01:01:23.213 --> 01:01:25.147
It's like a complete arch.

01:01:25.149 --> 01:01:27.416
Hey, moose, keep it down,
we're trying to go to bed.

01:01:27.418 --> 01:01:29.751
Oh, I'll keep it down,
but you have to keep talking

01:01:29.753 --> 01:01:32.721
cause the night rainbow
will go away if you don't
keep talking to it.

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:36.692
Me and my blood brothers
were thrown into sea.

01:01:36.694 --> 01:01:41.930
Then we're 20,000 leagues down
when we find Atlantis.

01:01:41.932 --> 01:01:45.067
And then Bruce Willis is like
the president of Atlantis,

01:01:45.069 --> 01:01:49.438
and he's like, dudes, you guys
gotta get Atlantis back up

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.972
to the earth.

01:01:50.974 --> 01:01:52.407
And like we are on earth.

01:01:52.409 --> 01:01:56.878
And he's like,
"what? This is earth?"

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.281
I'm just spitballing,
so, this is--

01:01:59.283 --> 01:02:01.349
Moose, seriously,
go to sleep.

01:02:07.323 --> 01:02:10.926
But one more--
one more thought.

01:02:10.928 --> 01:02:14.930
Jeff goldblum is like
the secretary of state

01:02:14.932 --> 01:02:16.398
in Atlantis,

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:21.136
and he's like, I'm gonna upload
a virus to Atlantis,

01:02:21.138 --> 01:02:24.039
- and then Atlantis--
- Shh.

01:02:30.113 --> 01:02:33.749
Okay, so it's been kinda quiet
the last couple days,

01:02:33.751 --> 01:02:36.151
so I'll just give
a quick update.

01:02:36.153 --> 01:02:38.120
Mickey's still pissed
at moose.

01:02:38.122 --> 01:02:40.188
They're not talking.

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:43.058
It's actually
kinda sad, really.

01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:46.795
And Steve goes into
this random psycho mode.

01:02:46.797 --> 01:02:48.463
I'm kinda worried about
what's gonna happen to him

01:02:48.465 --> 01:02:50.999
after we leave this place.

01:02:51.001 --> 01:02:56.138
Oh, and uh, Steve, I know
you're gonna hate me,

01:02:56.140 --> 01:03:00.142
but, uh, yesterday
i thought I saw something.

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:04.212
It was like a--

01:03:04.214 --> 01:03:07.816
well, I can't really say
for sure what it was, but...

01:03:09.318 --> 01:03:11.920
God, I don't know.

01:03:11.922 --> 01:03:14.389
I didn't wanna say anything,

01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:19.294
but maybe I'm losing
my mind, too.

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:22.397
-Anyway, until next time.
-Let me go! I saw it.

01:03:22.399 --> 01:03:24.533
-This is captain Jamie
signing off.
-I saw it, dude.

01:03:24.535 --> 01:03:28.303
-He was right there.
-God, I'm don't really like
the sound of that.

01:03:30.439 --> 01:03:32.174
-Hey, Steve?
-What?

01:03:32.176 --> 01:03:35.377
-You wanna maybe stop
and set up?
-No.

01:03:35.379 --> 01:03:39.080
-Get some rest?
-We have a lot
of ground to cover.

01:03:39.082 --> 01:03:41.917
Yeah, I know we do,
but we're all pretty tired.

01:03:41.919 --> 01:03:43.218
Yeah, dude, and I'm hungry.

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:44.886
Well, why don't you eat
more gummy bears!

01:03:44.888 --> 01:03:46.888
Mickey, quiet! Did you just
throw a pine cone at me?

01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:48.824
-If I had a grenade
you would have blown up.
-Stop! Relax!

01:03:48.826 --> 01:03:51.493
-A grenade?
-God.

01:03:51.495 --> 01:03:53.228
Fine, you wanna rest,
we can rest.

01:03:58.467 --> 01:04:02.537
Hey Mickey, you wanna
go get some wild tracks?

01:04:02.539 --> 01:04:04.840
Sure.

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:14.182
Steve, can we talk
for a second?

01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:15.984
Moose, why are you
not shooting?

01:04:15.986 --> 01:04:18.053
I told you you need to be
rolling this whole time.

01:04:18.055 --> 01:04:19.221
Okay.

01:04:21.991 --> 01:04:24.626
Hey, Steve, am I an asshole?

01:04:24.628 --> 01:04:29.464
Moose, the word asshole can mean
so many different things.

01:04:29.466 --> 01:04:30.966
Yeah, but what's
Mickey's problem?

01:04:30.968 --> 01:04:32.167
I mean, it's just
gummy bears, right?

01:04:32.169 --> 01:04:34.035
Not to him.

01:04:34.037 --> 01:04:35.370
He loves gummy bears.
That's his thing.

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:36.872
It brings him joy.

01:04:36.874 --> 01:04:38.240
Yeah, but that--

01:04:38.242 --> 01:04:40.075
you didn't think about
how he'd feel, did you?

01:04:40.077 --> 01:04:42.210
No, I didn't think
it would be a big deal.

01:04:42.212 --> 01:04:44.913
Moose, remember when you were
seven or eight,

01:04:44.915 --> 01:04:47.148
and you had that bike
that you loved to ride?

01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:49.084
You would ride that thing
every morning until it got dark.

01:04:49.086 --> 01:04:51.052
- Do you remember?
- Yeah, that chrome diamondback?

01:04:51.054 --> 01:04:53.054
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:04:53.056 --> 01:04:55.223
Now imagine if one
of your friends,

01:04:55.225 --> 01:04:56.558
someone you looked up to,

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:59.361
someone you trusted
took that from you.

01:04:59.363 --> 01:05:01.329
Mark Jacobson?

01:05:01.331 --> 01:05:02.564
Oh, that happened to you?

01:05:02.566 --> 01:05:04.466
Yeah, son of a bitch
stole my bike.

01:05:04.468 --> 01:05:06.468
Okay, we'll, remember
how you felt?

01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:08.103
That didn't feel good, did it?

01:05:08.105 --> 01:05:10.505
That is what Mickey
is feeling right now.

01:05:10.507 --> 01:05:12.107
- He looks up to you.
- Really?

01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:15.577
Yeah, yeah, he does.
I don't know why, but--

01:05:15.579 --> 01:05:18.113
I'll tell you why.
'Cause we're best buds.

01:05:18.115 --> 01:05:19.981
- You are.
You are best buddies.
- Yeah.

01:05:19.983 --> 01:05:23.485
You guys are such good friends
and I think the--

01:05:23.487 --> 01:05:27.055
- ah! What was that?
- What's happening, dude?

01:05:27.057 --> 01:05:29.257
Uh, a bug just
went in my nose

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:32.260
and grabbed a piece
of my brain or--

01:05:32.262 --> 01:05:35.063
- and flew away.
- Okay, well, look,

01:05:35.065 --> 01:05:36.498
I'll just apologize
when he gets back.

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:37.999
-Cool?
-Yeah, do that.

01:05:38.001 --> 01:05:40.001
Oh, my god, Jesus.
What the hell was--

01:05:42.204 --> 01:05:44.272
-hey, good work, Mickey.
-Thanks.

01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:46.408
Just make sure you log
everything, okay?

01:05:46.410 --> 01:05:47.943
I will.

01:05:59.388 --> 01:06:04.159
Hey, Mick, did you get
everything you needed,
the wild stuff?

01:06:04.161 --> 01:06:05.961
Get out of here,
gummy bar stealer!

01:06:05.963 --> 01:06:09.197
Come on, Mickey, I was a regular
mark Jacobson back there.

01:06:09.199 --> 01:06:12.033
-You didn't deserve it.
-What the hell are you
talking about, dude?

01:06:12.035 --> 01:06:14.369
Look, man, I know
you love your gummy bears

01:06:14.371 --> 01:06:16.237
and I shouldn't
have eaten them.

01:06:16.239 --> 01:06:18.406
I shouldn't have
stolen from you.

01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:21.743
I just don't want you
to be mad at me anymore.

01:06:21.745 --> 01:06:24.612
I don't have a lot
of friends, dude.

01:06:24.614 --> 01:06:27.382
You're like my best friend.

01:06:27.384 --> 01:06:30.185
-It was all I had left, man.
-I know, I know, Mickey,

01:06:30.187 --> 01:06:32.187
and I promise you
I'll buy you, like, five packs

01:06:32.189 --> 01:06:33.722
when we get back
into town, okay?

01:06:33.724 --> 01:06:36.358
-Only five?
-No, no, not just five.

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:37.559
What's your favorite number?

01:06:37.561 --> 01:06:40.295
-47.
-47? No, I'll buy you 10.

01:06:40.297 --> 01:06:42.497
47, that's ridiculous.

01:06:44.467 --> 01:06:45.567
10's cool.

01:06:45.569 --> 01:06:47.669
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:06:47.671 --> 01:06:49.404
So are we.

01:06:49.406 --> 01:06:50.739
Put that away.

01:06:50.741 --> 01:06:52.507
Come here, you lovable
son of a bitch.

01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:55.143
Oh! It was so hard
being mad at you.

01:06:55.145 --> 01:06:56.711
No, I know.

01:06:58.347 --> 01:07:01.783
What's that?

01:07:01.785 --> 01:07:03.785
You know what, Mick?
$1,000 can buy you

01:07:03.787 --> 01:07:06.755
-a whole gummy bear factory.
-Really?

01:07:06.757 --> 01:07:09.057
- Yeah, dude, and I was thinking,
if the market's right,

01:07:09.059 --> 01:07:10.759
-we'd buy a castle.
-Okay.

01:07:10.761 --> 01:07:14.062
What is he doing?

01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:17.632
Oh, god.

01:07:21.171 --> 01:07:22.570
Stop.

01:07:22.572 --> 01:07:25.440
Dude, if we stop,
I'm not moving again.

01:07:25.442 --> 01:07:27.142
- He's here.
- Hey, no offense, Steve,

01:07:27.144 --> 01:07:29.210
but you've said that
a few times already, bud.

01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:32.414
- He's here!
 -Okay, Steve, what do you want us to do?

01:07:32.416 --> 01:07:33.648
Did you fart, man?

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:35.283
It's always a possibility.

01:07:35.285 --> 01:07:36.818
Right, I want you two
to set up camp here.

01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:38.586
With the camera
on constant record,

01:07:38.588 --> 01:07:41.122
set up over there, aiming
towards those trees over there.

01:07:41.124 --> 01:07:42.657
-Copy?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We get it.

01:07:42.659 --> 01:07:44.492
Jamie, I want you to rig
the camera up there.

01:07:44.494 --> 01:07:47.162
And make it so that it does
a 360-degree rotation

01:07:47.164 --> 01:07:48.630
around the surrounding area.

01:07:48.632 --> 01:07:50.698
I want every inch
of these woods accounted for.

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:52.367
-Um, Steve--
-and I want it
to occasionally

01:07:52.369 --> 01:07:55.837
come down and scan our camp
when it senses movement,

01:07:55.839 --> 01:07:57.338
motion sensors.

01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:59.574
The beast is messing with us.
He's here,

01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:02.477
Steve, we don't have that kind
of equipment or technology
to do that, so i--

01:08:02.479 --> 01:08:06.081
silence! Make it happen, Jamie!

01:08:06.083 --> 01:08:08.516
- God.
- Do it quickly.
Something's coming.

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:12.654
Good luck with that,
sweetheart.

01:08:12.656 --> 01:08:14.289
Moose, don't.

01:08:14.291 --> 01:08:16.357
Hey, Jamie, if you want,
i can help you with that.

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:18.225
- No, Mickey, I'm okay.
 -I'll give you a boost or something.

01:08:18.228 --> 01:08:19.327
No.

01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:24.131
How's that
for 360-motion sensors?

01:08:24.134 --> 01:08:27.234
I wish we could
just do it like this.

01:08:27.237 --> 01:08:30.404
-I can't get it in.
-No, dude, no.
Don't start on that one yet.

01:08:30.407 --> 01:08:31.738
-Why?
-Cause I don't
got this one in.

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:38.212
Oh, man, look at this mess
of a human being.

01:08:38.215 --> 01:08:40.515
Dude, over there.
Get him!

01:08:40.517 --> 01:08:42.684
You're gonna find him,

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:45.220
if you just keep looking around
with the camera,

01:08:45.221 --> 01:08:47.188
you're gonna find bigfoot.

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:49.457
You are crazy!

01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:52.160
Hey, so, I think we're down
to our last battery.

01:08:52.162 --> 01:08:54.496
Uh, I think we should
be okay, moose.

01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:56.296
Do you think Steve's
gonna be okay?

01:08:56.299 --> 01:08:59.267
- Oh, yeah, he'll be fine.
 -Oh, god, I don't know.

01:08:59.269 --> 01:09:01.669
Right now he's doing some sort
of a native American dance

01:09:01.671 --> 01:09:03.770
-to help bring
the beast to life.
-What?

01:09:03.773 --> 01:09:05.673
- Look at him.
-  -At least he looks good.

01:09:05.675 --> 01:09:07.809
Uh, no he does not.

01:09:09.845 --> 01:09:13.281
Okay, so, our Van is parked
four miles away.

01:09:13.283 --> 01:09:15.483
-We should really start
hiking early. Yeah?
-Okay.

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:19.420
Show yourself! Show yourself,
you bastard of a beast, you!

01:09:19.421 --> 01:09:22.290
Okay, then, well, you know what?
I'm gonna be much happier

01:09:22.292 --> 01:09:24.158
-when we're on the road again.
-Yeah, tell me about it.

01:09:24.161 --> 01:09:25.426
I'm dancing for you,

01:09:25.428 --> 01:09:27.662
you mammoth
of a monster bastard.

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:31.432
-What is he saying?
-Hmm, sounds like
my uncle Dave at weddings.

01:09:31.434 --> 01:09:34.636
So what are you gonna do
with your $1,000?

01:09:34.638 --> 01:09:36.504
Oh, I'm not gonna take it.

01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:37.772
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:09:37.774 --> 01:09:40.274
Why not? That was the deal.

01:09:40.277 --> 01:09:41.943
I don't know.

01:09:41.944 --> 01:09:43.745
- I feel bad.
- Well, I don't.

01:09:43.747 --> 01:09:45.313
This two weeks has sucked.

01:09:45.314 --> 01:09:46.514
- Oh, they've sucked, moose?
- Yeah.

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:47.814
Have they? Yeah.
You've had fun.

01:09:47.817 --> 01:09:49.450
- Just admit it.
- She got you.

01:09:49.452 --> 01:09:52.287
Stop it.
 You, especially you, stop it.

01:09:52.288 --> 01:09:54.556
Here, you know what? Whenever
I'm going to bed, take this.

01:09:54.558 --> 01:09:56.691
- Yeah,
I'm going to bed, too.
- Guys! Guys, come here!

01:09:56.693 --> 01:09:58.193
Come quick! I found him!
I found the beast!

01:09:58.195 --> 01:10:01.396
Okay, I'm gonna punch him
in the face.

01:10:01.398 --> 01:10:02.764
That's it, he's dead.

01:10:02.766 --> 01:10:05.400
He's over here!
He's glorious!

01:10:05.402 --> 01:10:07.535
- No, he's not glorious.
- Hey, Steve?

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:09.537
Over here! Come quick!

01:10:09.539 --> 01:10:11.306
- Where are you?
- I'm over here.

01:10:11.308 --> 01:10:11.306
He's gonna get a glorious fist
in the face.

01:10:11.308 --> 01:10:15.376
- It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen!
-  -What is he saying?

01:10:15.378 --> 01:10:16.678
Oh, gosh, what is it, dude?

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:17.812
He's right here.

01:10:17.814 --> 01:10:18.947
- What?
- Who?

01:10:18.949 --> 01:10:20.748
He's right here!

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:22.617
- What is that?
- Is that a turtle?

01:10:22.619 --> 01:10:24.252
- What?
-  -I said, is that a turtle?

01:10:24.254 --> 01:10:25.753
- Oh, Steve.
- No, it's bigfoot.

01:10:25.755 --> 01:10:27.488
- Steve, it's a turtle.
- No, it's bigfoot!

01:10:27.490 --> 01:10:28.723
It's the beast!

01:10:28.725 --> 01:10:30.959
Steve, that is
a freaking turtle, man!

01:10:30.961 --> 01:10:32.360
What do you mean?
It's bigfoot!

01:10:32.362 --> 01:10:33.428
No, it's a turtle!

01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:35.563
You're-- you're gone, dude.

01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:39.534
- Where are you going?
- Captain crazy, man.

01:10:39.536 --> 01:10:40.935
Hey, that's a turtle, Steve.

01:10:40.937 --> 01:10:42.704
-What?
-Yeah.

01:10:42.706 --> 01:10:45.773
Bigfoots, they're bigger,
and they don't have shells.

01:10:45.775 --> 01:10:48.943
He's-- he's a cute
little guy, at least.

01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:53.615
But he's not bigfoot, Steve.

01:10:53.617 --> 01:10:55.483
I'm really sorry.

01:10:55.485 --> 01:10:59.520
-Mickey, I found him.
-No, you didn't, Steve.

01:10:59.522 --> 01:11:03.925
-I found him.
-You tried your best.

01:11:03.927 --> 01:11:05.693
You tried your best, Steve.

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:08.463
Where are they going?

01:11:10.766 --> 01:11:12.900
Jamie?

01:11:12.902 --> 01:11:17.472
Oh, Steve, I'm sorry.

01:11:17.474 --> 01:11:20.008
I'm so, so sorry, Steve.

01:11:28.884 --> 01:11:30.952
It's not bigfoot, is it?

01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:34.389
No.

01:11:38.994 --> 01:11:43.498
- What am I doing?
- I don't know.

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:49.370
Steve, maybe you're just trying
a little too hard.

01:11:49.372 --> 01:11:51.506
I thought for sure
that this was him.

01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:01.349
- What is this?
-  -Oh, that wasn't very nice, Steven.

01:12:02.818 --> 01:12:04.752
I'm a failure.

01:12:06.422 --> 01:12:08.523
- I'm a joke.
- No, Steve.

01:12:08.525 --> 01:12:11.826
You're not a failure,
and you're not a joke. Okay?

01:12:12.761 --> 01:12:14.729
It's okay.

01:12:14.731 --> 01:12:20.601
Hey, Steve, come on, I mean
we all came out here together.

01:12:20.603 --> 01:12:23.371
And we had fun, right?

01:12:25.374 --> 01:12:26.674
Steve?

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:31.446
You know what?
You've got a great movie.

01:12:31.448 --> 01:12:32.880
Okay?

01:12:34.049 --> 01:12:37.118
And-- and tomorrow
we'll just go--

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:39.087
can we just go back
to camp?

01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:41.422
Okay.

01:12:42.358 --> 01:12:43.758
Sure.

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:51.532
Ah, the end of the road.

01:12:51.534 --> 01:12:52.800
Wake up you
miserable losers,

01:12:52.802 --> 01:12:54.802
it's time to get
the hell out of dodge.

01:12:54.804 --> 01:12:57.438
-Oh, god.
-But we haven't
found him yet.

01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:00.108
Nope, it was two weeks,
right, stevesy?

01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:04.011
- And I'm $2,000 richer.
- $1,000.

01:13:04.013 --> 01:13:05.546
Dude, it's two,
he's crazy. Go for it.

01:13:05.548 --> 01:13:06.881
Moose, shut up.

01:13:06.883 --> 01:13:08.483
Look, we gave it
our best shot,

01:13:08.485 --> 01:13:09.884
but I think it's time
we all admit

01:13:09.886 --> 01:13:12.019
that bigfoot
is some sort of hoax

01:13:12.021 --> 01:13:14.422
that some guy made up
a long time ago.

01:13:14.424 --> 01:13:15.723
Hey, just because
we didn't find him

01:13:15.725 --> 01:13:17.425
doesn't mean
he doesn't exist.

01:13:17.427 --> 01:13:18.993
We can try again,
right, Steve?

01:13:18.995 --> 01:13:21.129
I thought this was it.
I was sure.

01:13:21.131 --> 01:13:24.665
Hey, my friends,
i think I speak for all of us

01:13:24.667 --> 01:13:27.001
when I say that bigfoot
doesn't exist.

01:13:27.003 --> 01:13:29.437
This is captain moose saying
don't stay tuned.

01:13:29.439 --> 01:13:31.439
Shut up, moose!

01:13:31.441 --> 01:13:33.674
Hey, Jamie, I really wish
we did find bigfoot.

01:13:33.676 --> 01:13:36.544
It would make me use
my gun on something.

01:13:36.546 --> 01:13:39.013
It's okay, Steve.

01:13:39.015 --> 01:13:41.816
You just--
got a little--

01:13:41.818 --> 01:13:43.851
you know what?

01:13:43.853 --> 01:13:47.822
-I think you were
an incredible captain.
-No.

01:13:47.824 --> 01:13:49.557
-I was sure of it.
We were right there.
-I know.

01:13:49.559 --> 01:13:50.992
And, you know what?

01:13:50.994 --> 01:13:53.961
Maybe we can even
try again sometime, huh?

01:13:53.963 --> 01:13:56.898
Hells to the no.

01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:58.633
Let's just start packing, huh?

01:13:58.635 --> 01:14:00.601
Can you put that thing down
and help me?

01:14:03.205 --> 01:14:06.507
Hey, Mickey, I'm getting
some b roll.

01:14:06.509 --> 01:14:08.743
Butt roll?

01:14:08.745 --> 01:14:10.678
That's not going
in the movie.

01:14:13.215 --> 01:14:17.084
-Hey, guys!
-What's he doing?

01:14:17.086 --> 01:14:19.086
All right, Steve,
let's go, buddy.

01:14:19.088 --> 01:14:20.621
Come on, Steve,
we gotta go.

01:14:20.623 --> 01:14:22.156
- I'm staying.
- What?

01:14:22.158 --> 01:14:23.658
- I'm not moving.
- Steve--

01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:25.560
okay, this is not funny.
Get up!

01:14:25.562 --> 01:14:27.128
You can't just
stay here, Steve.

01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:29.096
Yes, I can. Watch me.

01:14:29.098 --> 01:14:30.531
Dude, you better
start moving,

01:14:30.533 --> 01:14:32.600
cause if you don't,
I'm leaving.

01:14:32.602 --> 01:14:33.868
And you know what, fine.

01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:35.069
You guys just
wait here with him,

01:14:35.071 --> 01:14:36.737
I'm done with this.
I'm outta here.

01:14:36.739 --> 01:14:38.506
Moose.

01:14:38.508 --> 01:14:40.174
- I'll come with you.
- Get outta here.

01:14:40.176 --> 01:14:41.742
Steve...

01:14:41.744 --> 01:14:44.078
You gotta
come with us now, okay?

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:45.613
Two weeks.

01:14:45.615 --> 01:14:47.248
That was the plan,
remember?

01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:49.150
It was a real
nice turtle, Steve.

01:14:49.152 --> 01:14:51.586
I'm sorry I wasted
your guys time,

01:14:51.588 --> 01:14:54.021
but I'm staying.
I'm supposed to be here.

01:14:54.023 --> 01:14:56.123
What should we do?

01:14:56.125 --> 01:14:57.992
I hope you stay there, man.

01:14:57.994 --> 01:15:01.529
I hope you get
eaten by bears.

01:15:01.531 --> 01:15:05.500
Okay, you need to think about
what you're doing here, Steve.

01:15:05.502 --> 01:15:06.667
What are you gonna do?

01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:08.503
Just sit in the woods and wait?

01:15:08.505 --> 01:15:10.671
Yeah, that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

01:15:10.673 --> 01:15:13.641
You guys should go.
Here, take this.

01:15:13.643 --> 01:15:15.576
Steve! Steve!

01:15:18.013 --> 01:15:21.148
- What's that?
- Huh?

01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:22.717
Steve, you should
take a look at that.

01:15:22.719 --> 01:15:24.619
Whatever it is,
it is big.

01:15:24.621 --> 01:15:26.554
Hey, moose! Come back here!

01:15:26.556 --> 01:15:28.689
No, wait! I can't see
with you guys in the way!

01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:31.692
- I'm excited and nervous right now.
 -Mickey, be quiet.

01:15:31.694 --> 01:15:33.060
As a mouse, Steve!

01:15:35.932 --> 01:15:37.899
- Oh, my god.
- What the hell?

01:15:37.901 --> 01:15:40.167
That's two bigfoots banging
the shit out of each other.

01:15:40.169 --> 01:15:42.937
Yeah, they're going
at it hard.

01:15:42.939 --> 01:15:44.138
This is incredible, Jamie,
are you getting this?

01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:46.674
I'm definitely getting this.

01:15:46.676 --> 01:15:48.843
- Huh, they do smell like passion fruit.
-  -Yeah, you're right.

01:15:48.845 --> 01:15:51.712
We found him. Two weeks.
But we found him.

01:15:51.714 --> 01:15:53.981
People have spent their entire
lives searching for bigfoot,

01:15:53.983 --> 01:15:56.851
and to them I say, ha!
A mystery no longer!

01:15:56.853 --> 01:15:59.320
The record books in the museum
shall forever know my name

01:15:59.322 --> 01:16:00.922
- and I owe it all to--
- Where you going?

01:16:00.924 --> 01:16:02.156
Jamie, where you going?

01:16:02.158 --> 01:16:03.758
Holy shit, it's staring
straight at us.

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.860
Oh, Steve, it's staring
straight at you.

01:16:05.862 --> 01:16:05.860
- No, no, it just wants
to communicate.

01:16:05.862 --> 01:16:08.796
- No, Steve, you should run.
-  -Definitely not.

01:16:08.798 --> 01:16:10.131
Hi, I'm captain Steve.

01:16:10.133 --> 01:16:11.999
We travelled a long way
to make this appearance.

01:16:12.001 --> 01:16:14.869
- Oh! Oh! Jesus!
- Run, Steve!

01:16:14.871 --> 01:16:17.038
Run, Steve!

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:18.940
I can't run,
it's very strong, Mickey.

01:16:18.942 --> 01:16:20.207
Mickey, do something!

01:16:20.209 --> 01:16:22.143
You do something,
you're the lesbian

01:16:22.145 --> 01:16:24.145
- What the hell does that mean?
 -I don't know!

01:16:24.147 --> 01:16:25.713
Don't stop shooting this!

01:16:25.715 --> 01:16:27.748
Try fighting, Steve!

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:30.318
I don't think you understand
how strong he is, Mickey!

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:31.586
I will save you!

01:16:31.588 --> 01:16:33.588
Coming, Steve!

01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:35.189
Ow! Ow!

01:16:35.191 --> 01:16:37.158
I'm coming for you, buddy!

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:38.926
What are you doing?

01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:40.061
Don't stop shooting!

01:16:40.063 --> 01:16:42.263
I'm sorry! Okay.

01:16:42.265 --> 01:16:45.299
Oh, sleeper hold.
I'm falling asleep.

01:16:45.301 --> 01:16:46.701
No!

01:16:48.071 --> 01:16:50.304
Mickey, where did
you get a chair?

01:16:50.306 --> 01:16:52.106
Oh, I don't know.

01:16:53.676 --> 01:16:56.310
Hey, bigfoot!

01:16:56.312 --> 01:16:59.146
Yippee ki-yay, motherfucker!

01:17:00.650 --> 01:17:03.918
Got him.

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:05.686
Ow! You shot me!

01:17:05.688 --> 01:17:07.722
-Oh, shit, dude.
-Why would you shoot me?

01:17:07.724 --> 01:17:09.323
- I'm an idiot, man.
- Oh, my god!

01:17:09.325 --> 01:17:12.026
-Steve, are you okay?
-No!

01:17:12.028 --> 01:17:14.629
- Oh, moose, take the camera!
-  -Okay, I'm sorry.

01:17:14.631 --> 01:17:16.964
-Mickey, help me
put pressure on it.
-No, no, thank you.

01:17:16.966 --> 01:17:18.332
-Do it!
-Okay.

01:17:18.334 --> 01:17:20.334
Oh.

01:17:20.336 --> 01:17:21.702
Moose, you are
a terrible shot.

01:17:21.704 --> 01:17:23.638
I wasn't even close to him.

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:25.973
I know, man, I'm sorry.
I had my eyes closed.

01:17:25.975 --> 01:17:28.342
-Where did he go?
-He ran right off
into the woods, Steve.

01:17:28.344 --> 01:17:30.311
But we got it right.
We got him all on tape.

01:17:30.313 --> 01:17:32.113
We got the whole thing!

01:17:32.115 --> 01:17:34.181
-Really?
-Yeah, well,
most of it, yeah.

01:17:34.183 --> 01:17:35.716
Well, that should
be fine, right?

01:17:35.718 --> 01:17:37.251
- Yeah.
- Oh, he fainted.

01:17:37.253 --> 01:17:38.786
Oh, he is out.

01:17:38.788 --> 01:17:40.888
Okay, guys, help me
get him out of here.

01:17:40.890 --> 01:17:41.956
Dibs on not carrying him.

01:17:41.958 --> 01:17:43.157
Dibs on not carrying him.

01:17:43.159 --> 01:17:44.692
I am your captain now,

01:17:44.694 --> 01:17:46.994
and you're gonna help me
get him out.

01:17:46.996 --> 01:17:48.729
I'm bleeding pretty badly,

01:17:48.731 --> 01:17:50.431
but it's all worth it.

01:17:50.433 --> 01:17:53.668
-Yeah, good, drink this.
-We found him.

01:17:53.670 --> 01:17:55.136
We found him.

01:17:55.138 --> 01:17:57.438
We have hard without
a shadow of a doubt evidence

01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:59.240
that bigfoot does exist.

01:17:59.242 --> 01:18:00.941
A mystery no more.

01:18:00.943 --> 01:18:02.343
Yeah, but you look
like shit there, dude.

01:18:02.345 --> 01:18:03.911
Steve, you're really heavy.

01:18:03.913 --> 01:18:07.114
Because of us,
myth has become truth.

01:18:07.116 --> 01:18:11.385
Because of us,
the world now knows
the secret of bigfoot.

01:18:11.387 --> 01:18:13.320
-My arms are falling asleep.
-Oh, god, mine, too.

01:18:13.322 --> 01:18:15.790
And I don't owe
this asshole any money!

01:18:15.792 --> 01:18:16.857
I'm carrying you.

01:18:16.859 --> 01:18:17.925
Hey, it's Willie ray!

01:18:17.927 --> 01:18:19.727
-What?
-Well, well, well.

01:18:19.729 --> 01:18:20.795
Looks like you found him.

01:18:20.797 --> 01:18:21.929
That we did, Willie ray.

01:18:21.931 --> 01:18:23.364
That we did.

01:18:23.366 --> 01:18:25.366
He was making love
to a lady friend.

01:18:25.368 --> 01:18:27.301
Oh, yeah, it's Friday.

01:18:27.303 --> 01:18:28.436
Goddamn, what did he do?
Shoot you?

01:18:28.438 --> 01:18:30.337
Oh, no, that was me.

01:18:30.339 --> 01:18:32.373
-Hey, guys, stop here
for a second.
-Aw, come on!

01:18:32.375 --> 01:18:37.144
Willie ray, as the majestic
monster was beating my face in--

01:18:37.146 --> 01:18:39.747
-yeah, he's gonna do it to you.
-He looked into my eyes,

01:18:39.749 --> 01:18:43.384
and it was right then and there
that I understood.

01:18:43.386 --> 01:18:45.720
He wanted me to give
this to you.

01:18:45.722 --> 01:18:48.422
Oh, see? I told you
he was good for it.

01:18:48.424 --> 01:18:50.725
-You weren't lying.
-No, sir, I wasn't.

01:18:50.727 --> 01:18:53.027
-Did he really give
that to you, Steve?
-Yeah, he did, Jamie,

01:18:53.029 --> 01:18:55.763
right after he punched me
in the face repeatedly.

01:18:55.765 --> 01:18:58.399
He put it in my pocket,
but he looked me in the eyes.

01:18:58.401 --> 01:18:59.934
Yeah, he's a good guy.

01:18:59.936 --> 01:19:01.502
Yeah, he did beat me up
pretty good though.

01:19:01.504 --> 01:19:03.804
Well, you know
he's a little rough.
A little rough.

01:19:03.806 --> 01:19:06.040
But at the end of the day,
i just think he's a little
misunderstood.

01:19:06.042 --> 01:19:07.374
I think that, too.

01:19:07.376 --> 01:19:09.510
-It's times like these--
-gosh, Jesus.

01:19:09.512 --> 01:19:13.347
That we as a people,
as human beings must look

01:19:13.349 --> 01:19:14.982
-in the mirror and truly--
-okay.

01:19:14.984 --> 01:19:16.150
- Oh!
- Oh, shit!
