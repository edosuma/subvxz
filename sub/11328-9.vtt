00:03.200 --> 00:05.500
Dad, just take a break and
go and see the house.

00:05.600 --> 00:08.000
It'll be gone if george ever
really puts it on the market.

00:08.100 --> 00:09.400
Maybe i should have dated more.

00:09.500 --> 00:10.900
You were pregnant when we broke up.

00:10.900 --> 00:13.900
Maybe i just gave in too easily
to both you and to david.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.200
I do not want adrian
living next door to amy.

00:16.300 --> 00:18.300
Why not? Afraid she'll catch you
lying about where you are?

00:18.400 --> 00:21.100
Amy thinks this whole find
something in common routine

00:21.100 --> 00:23.200
Is just a cover for your trying
to be interested in her.

00:23.200 --> 00:26.400
She's hounding me to tell her
that you had sex with some girl.

00:26.500 --> 00:28.500
- Why don't you just tell her?
- Because i didn't.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.500
Did you see madison
a lot last summer?

00:30.600 --> 00:33.300
It was nothing. We just had a few
meetings of the dead parents club.

00:33.300 --> 00:35.300
Maybe it's time you
and ricky both admit that

00:35.300 --> 00:38.000
Even though you love each other,
you cheat on each other

00:38.000 --> 00:39.800
Because you're afraid to be loved.

00:39.900 --> 00:42.700
Adrian told me that ricky
slept over a few times this summer.

00:42.700 --> 00:44.700
He promised he wouldn't
say anything to anyone.

00:45.100 --> 00:48.400
- You put him down this minute.
- Don't get upset. I was just holding him.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.700
You're never bringing
him over here again.

00:51.800 --> 00:53.200
- I don't want that--
- Slut.

00:53.300 --> 00:54.300
...touching my baby.

00:54.400 --> 00:56.400
I'm not living next door to you.

00:56.600 --> 00:59.800
I'm afraid you are. My dad called.
Your dad accepted the offer.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.099
Where's amy? We're going to be late.

01:05.099 --> 01:07.000
She'll be here. You're not that late.

01:08.800 --> 01:10.900
- Are you okay?
- No, i'm not okay.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.800
Look, i'm just going to say it.
I think you should date.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.700
Date? Who?

01:16.800 --> 01:19.200
I don't know, but there's probably
a dating service for pregnant women.

01:19.200 --> 01:22.000
Yeah, probably. It's
probably for perverts.

01:22.100 --> 01:24.600
Mom, before you let dad back in, i---

01:25.000 --> 01:26.200
I have to say something.

01:26.900 --> 01:29.100
I don't think it may be
the best idea after all.

01:29.200 --> 01:31.900
I mean, i thought it was,
but now i'm not sure.

01:31.900 --> 01:34.800
Ashley, he sold the house.
Just deal with it.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.200
You and your dad had your fun.

01:36.200 --> 01:39.400
I am dealing with it, and to be
honest, it wasn't very fun.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.700
Just spit it out, ashley.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.800
You didn't even have a
chance to get out there,

01:42.900 --> 01:45.100
And all because of dad
and his stupid vasectomy.

01:45.400 --> 01:46.700
Come on, mom. Please.

01:47.100 --> 01:49.500
Just don't go back
with him just yet.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.400
Date. I mean,
go out with someone.

01:52.500 --> 01:55.100
Don't you have an old friend to call
that you could go out with?

01:55.200 --> 01:56.100
There must be someone.

01:56.100 --> 01:58.700
I do have some old
friends, but ashley--

01:58.700 --> 02:01.000
Call them. Send them a picture.???

02:01.300 --> 02:03.900
Yeah, you're pregnant,
but you're still beautiful.

02:04.100 --> 02:06.900
Please, mom. Please. Just for fun.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.199
Just to get out of the house
before the baby comes.???

02:09.199 --> 02:12.400
You've seen what having a baby's
done to amy,??? She has no life.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.200
Is there something
you're not telling me?

02:15.300 --> 02:18.900
Are you and your sister conspiring to keep
your dad and i apart for some reason?

02:18.900 --> 02:20.500
I would never work with amy.

02:22.700 --> 02:24.100
He's dating.

02:24.700 --> 02:26.900
Or i think he's dating.

02:27.100 --> 02:29.200
Oh, is he?

02:30.200 --> 02:31.500
Well...

02:33.600 --> 02:34.800
Go get your camera.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:49.100 --> 02:50.800
- What'd you forget?
- My camera.

02:51.300 --> 02:52.300
Oh, and by the way, if we move back,

02:52.300 --> 02:54.900
I'm not taking the stinking
furniture from your store.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.900
I want something old.
Something antique.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.900
I don't care. I just borrowed
this stuff from the store anyway.

02:58.900 --> 03:00.100
I can take it back and sell it.

03:00.100 --> 03:01.700
You didn't buy it
in the first place?

03:01.800 --> 03:03.800
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.000
Hey, it's going to be fun, sunshine.
You're getting your old room back.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.700
No, i'm not. John's in it.

03:07.900 --> 03:09.800
And you don't even know if you're
getting your old room back.

03:09.900 --> 03:11.200
We could both be in the
garage for all we know,

03:11.200 --> 03:13.300
And if we are, you're taking out the urinal.

03:13.900 --> 03:15.800
Your mother asked me to take that
out the week after we left.

03:15.800 --> 03:16.600
What, you kept it?

03:16.600 --> 03:18.600
It's brand new. I got it in my car.

03:18.700 --> 03:20.400
- I'm selling it online.
- Good for you.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.000
Maybe you can trade it for a dog.

03:22.900 --> 03:23.600
I still want a dog.

03:23.600 --> 03:25.400
We're not getting a dog once
we get back in the house.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.800
Exactly. Who knows if we'll
get back in the house?

03:27.900 --> 03:29.900
Sure we will. And i've still
got our name on the list

03:29.900 --> 03:32.300
To get one of those guide
dogs if one flunks out.

03:32.500 --> 03:33.100
Swell.

03:33.100 --> 03:36.600
Hey, the ones that flunk out are
still smarter than, um, other dogs.

03:36.700 --> 03:37.800
Were you going to say amy?

03:37.800 --> 03:39.800
No i was not. Your
sister's a very smart girl.

03:39.800 --> 03:42.100
Yeah, she obviously knows
how to lay down and roll over.

03:42.100 --> 03:45.300
Hey, that is not very nice.
What is wrong with you?

03:45.400 --> 03:47.000
I heard you talking on the phone,

03:47.600 --> 03:49.000
Making a date with some woman.

03:50.500 --> 03:52.000
You really stink, you know that?

03:57.300 --> 03:58.800
All right, let's go.
I can probably get these

03:58.800 --> 04:00.800
Loaded on your computer
before i leave for school.

04:27.500 --> 04:30.000
I told mom i will do that.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.200
Oh, it's okay, buddy. I got it.

04:31.300 --> 04:32.400
I'm a little taller than you are.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.300
What are you saying? I'm too short?

04:34.400 --> 04:35.400
No, i didn't say that.

04:35.500 --> 04:36.800
I could fix that.

04:36.900 --> 04:39.000
Yeah, i'm sure you could,
but your mom asked me to.

04:39.100 --> 04:39.900
Did you get it?

04:40.100 --> 04:43.800
Did you tell mom to
ask jack to do this?

04:43.900 --> 04:45.000
Is that a problem?

04:45.100 --> 04:48.000
I'm the man of the
house. I fix things.

04:48.200 --> 04:52.100
Of course you do. But jack is very good at
carpentry, so we thought he should do it.

04:52.200 --> 04:55.200
I told you before,
keep your paws off me.

04:57.300 --> 05:00.400
No, now he's upset.
This is not good.

05:00.500 --> 05:01.400
Don't worry about it.

05:01.800 --> 05:04.400
I'll take him out and throw the ball
around with him after practice.

05:04.500 --> 05:05.800
I can get him back on my good side.

05:05.900 --> 05:08.300
I don't know. He does hold a grudge.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.000
- Tom?
- Yeah, tom.

05:10.100 --> 05:12.100
- No, he doesn't.
- Yeah, he does.

05:13.300 --> 05:14.700
Come on, we have to stop
and pick up madison.

05:14.700 --> 05:16.300
Why do we have to stop
and pick up madison?

05:16.400 --> 05:17.500
I told her we would.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.400
She feels awkward riding
with jason and lauren.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.200
We're not going to pick
her up every day, are we?

05:21.300 --> 05:22.500
No, not every day.

05:23.400 --> 05:25.900
But soon i'll have my license, so i can
stop and pick her up whenever she wants.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.600
Yeah, but you don't
want to feel obligated

05:27.600 --> 05:29.900
To pick her up every day when
you get your license, do you?

05:29.900 --> 05:32.000
I don't mind. Then we can talk.

05:32.100 --> 05:33.200
Talk about?

05:33.600 --> 05:34.700
Good morning, jack.

05:34.900 --> 05:36.600
Thank you so much for
fixing the cabinet.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.600
It seems like everything
in the house is falling apart.

05:38.600 --> 05:39.300
Anytime.

05:39.400 --> 05:43.300
Mom, i think tom's a little upset
that we asked jack to do this.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.900
- Tom's upset?
- Yeah.

05:45.300 --> 05:47.400
I didn't think about it, but
maybe it wasn't such a good idea.

05:47.400 --> 05:48.400
Oh, no.

05:48.500 --> 05:51.200
What? I've never known
tom to have a temper.

05:51.700 --> 05:53.200
I mean, he wasn't happy when we--

05:54.100 --> 05:55.200
Well.

05:55.700 --> 05:58.800
I think it's all been
building since we--

05:58.900 --> 05:59.800
Probably.

05:59.900 --> 06:02.100
No, he's over that.
I'm sure he's over that.

06:02.400 --> 06:03.500
Because he knows we're not--

06:03.800 --> 06:05.300
Well, i think he
might think we're--

06:05.300 --> 06:06.300
But you're not.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.800
No, no, never again.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.500
Not until-- Unless
we're married. Promise.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.700
I'm telling you, i'll throw
the ball around with him

06:12.700 --> 06:14.400
And he'll be fine. Tom's a cool guy.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.600
He is, but not when he's upset.

06:17.300 --> 06:19.900
I know, i'll find something he can repair
while you guys are at school.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.300
Something where he can vent.

06:21.400 --> 06:22.800
Really, i don't think
he's that upset.

06:22.900 --> 06:24.300
He doesn't get upset often,

06:24.800 --> 06:25.900
But when he does,

06:26.500 --> 06:27.200
Watch out.

06:27.200 --> 06:29.200
- Really?
- Really.

06:29.300 --> 06:30.900
And i do think this has been building.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.800
I can't believe i did this.
What was i thinking?

06:33.900 --> 06:35.700
You two make him sound like rambo.

06:35.900 --> 06:37.700
It's tom. We're pals.

06:38.300 --> 06:40.700
Mom, please, please talk to him
and see what you can do.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.300
I don't want any trouble,
and we have to go to school.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.200
All right, grace. I'll try.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.200
- I'm going to get him.
- No, you're not, tom.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.800
You are not going to get him.
That wouldn't be right.

06:55.400 --> 06:56.900
Honey, you can do a lot of things,

06:56.900 --> 06:59.200
But you don't have any
experience with carpentry.

06:59.700 --> 07:02.800
And i have other projects. I have
lots of other projects you can do.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.300
- Like?
- Well, um...

07:07.500 --> 07:09.500
To start with, the entire
house needs vacuuming.

07:09.700 --> 07:12.600
Get a housekeeper. I'm a man, damn it.

07:16.600 --> 07:17.500
See you tonight.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.000
Wait, 30 days?

07:19.200 --> 07:20.900
We actually get the keys in 30 days?

07:21.000 --> 07:24.800
We do. So you've got 30 days to get
everything straightened out with amy.

07:24.900 --> 07:27.000
Me? She called me a slut.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.200
She's a new mom. She's territorial.

07:29.300 --> 07:29.900
John is her baby.

07:29.900 --> 07:33.000
Yeah, so i was holding
the baby. So what?

07:33.200 --> 07:35.100
It's ricky's baby, too.
He let me hold him.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.400
You're a smart girl.

07:36.700 --> 07:37.900
Be smart about this.

07:38.100 --> 07:39.600
And you know what i'm talking about.

07:39.700 --> 07:40.700
No, i don't.

07:40.700 --> 07:43.300
Right or wrong, amy doesn't
want you touching her baby,

07:43.400 --> 07:47.200
So apologize to her and tell her you didn't
realize it would be so upsetting to her

07:47.300 --> 07:49.100
And that it'll never happen again,

07:49.200 --> 07:50.900
Because you really want to
be friends with her.

07:51.300 --> 07:52.900
Especially now that we're
all going to be neighbors.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
I don't do that.

07:54.300 --> 07:56.100
I don't apologize when
i haven't done anything.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.300
You did do something.
You upset amy.

07:58.400 --> 07:59.900
So take responsibility for that.

08:00.000 --> 08:04.000
She's the one who should take responsibility
for being upset about nothing.

08:04.700 --> 08:07.900
And she owes me an apology.
She called me a slut.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.200
Adrian, you're sleeping with the guy
who's the father of her child.

08:11.300 --> 08:12.000
Yeah?

08:12.100 --> 08:16.500
No matter how much amy says she doesn't care
about ricky, she cares about ricky, okay?

08:16.800 --> 08:17.800
Deal with it.

08:18.100 --> 08:21.100
On some level, she cares about
ricky, and ricky cares about her.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.300
I'm not saying they're in love,
but they have a common bond,

08:24.500 --> 08:25.900
And that common bond is the baby.

08:26.300 --> 08:27.900
And that baby's not going anywhere.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.300
So you have to figure out
how to deal with all this,

08:30.300 --> 08:32.799
In a way that allows us all
to be good neighbors.

08:32.799 --> 08:33.900
Good neighbors?

08:34.400 --> 08:36.000
I'm not concerned about
being a good neighbor.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.200
Well, get concerned,

08:37.299 --> 08:39.400
'Cause i just signed
a 30 year mortgage.

08:40.100 --> 08:41.400
Have a nice day.

08:49.600 --> 08:50.700
What's going on?

08:51.300 --> 08:52.400
I'm waiting for amy.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.700
- Because?
- Because i'm a good neighbor.

08:54.800 --> 08:55.800
What does that mean?

08:56.600 --> 08:59.600
It means that my father wants me
to apologize for upsetting amy.

09:00.700 --> 09:03.400
And i'm trying to find a way
to do that without slapping her.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.100
Nice attitude. Very neighborly.

09:05.300 --> 09:06.300
I don't think i'll stick around.

09:06.400 --> 09:09.900
Why can't you tell her that's your son too
and i can hold him if you want me to hold him?

09:10.000 --> 09:12.200
Because i'd like to
continue holding him,

09:12.400 --> 09:13.200
And that's up to amy.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.200
You can go to court and get shared custody.

09:15.300 --> 09:17.300
I do not want to get
into any of that, so--

09:17.400 --> 09:18.800
Try to see that i don't.

09:19.400 --> 09:20.800
Adrian, if i have to go to court

09:20.900 --> 09:25.900
To get rights to see john, then the court
is also going to establish child support.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.800
I wrap pork chops for a living.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.700
I can't afford child support.???

09:29.900 --> 09:31.400
I give her 50 bucks a week,

09:31.800 --> 09:34.100
But any court would make me
pay more than that,

09:34.200 --> 09:35.300
And that's all i got.

09:35.300 --> 09:36.800
You give her money?

09:40.600 --> 09:42.200
Do not make problems for me.

09:53.300 --> 09:55.000
I smell danger. Bye.

09:58.900 --> 10:00.000
You look nice this morning.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.700
- You do, too. For a--
- Slut.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.200
You're going to call me a slut again?
Is that how it's going to be?

10:06.200 --> 10:09.000
Mm-Hm. So think about that
before you move in.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.500
- If you move in.
- We're moving in, all right.

10:11.800 --> 10:13.300
And you think about this.

10:13.800 --> 10:18.800
Ricky can just pick up his son and
walk over to my house any time he wants.

10:19.100 --> 10:21.200
And then i can hold john

10:21.300 --> 10:23.500
And feed him and rock him

10:24.000 --> 10:25.500
And be like a second mom.

10:25.600 --> 10:26.900
My dad's not
out of that house yet.

10:26.900 --> 10:29.600
You mean he's not out of
that house yet, slut?

10:30.600 --> 10:36.000
30 days. I'll be there in 30 days, and then
my family's going to be there for 30 years.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.800
Not if my dad backs out of the sale.

10:38.100 --> 10:40.800
And you know, he just might,
because my mother is dating.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.700
I don't think he's going to want to
move in once he finds out she's dating.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.900
Your pregnant mother's dating?

10:47.100 --> 10:48.200
And you think i'm a slut.

10:48.200 --> 10:49.600
That is it.

10:49.700 --> 10:51.600
I don't just think
you're a slut, adrian.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.200
You are a slut.

10:53.300 --> 10:53.900
Slut.

10:53.900 --> 10:56.500
Ladies, break it up now.

10:57.500 --> 10:58.800
Amy, i'm surprised at you.

10:58.900 --> 11:01.300
Oh, but not me? Thanks.

11:03.700 --> 11:05.800
I'm not going to put up with
this the entire school year,

11:05.800 --> 11:07.300
So you two find a way to get along.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.600
And if we can't?

11:08.700 --> 11:11.000
If you can't, you're both off the team.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
I'm not on a team.

11:12.100 --> 11:13.900
The whole school is my team.

11:14.500 --> 11:15.900
I'm talking suspension.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.200
I'm talking about sending
the two of you home.

11:18.600 --> 11:20.700
And since you're going to be
living next door to each other,

11:20.700 --> 11:23.500
That suspension wouldn't be
too much fun, now would it?

11:25.400 --> 11:26.500
What's going on?

11:28.700 --> 11:30.000
Three to one says she starts crying.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.900
50 bucks says it goes the other way.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.400
She doesn't look too weepy.

11:35.700 --> 11:36.800
Look, coach.

11:38.100 --> 11:38.600
You talking to me?

11:38.600 --> 11:40.300
You're the coach, aren't you?

11:40.400 --> 11:42.900
Look, you should be
talking to her, not me.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.600
- I'm the good one.
- Watch out, now.

11:44.700 --> 11:47.400
What? Adrian called my mother a slut.

11:47.600 --> 11:48.500
She implied it, anyway.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.400
You called adrian a slut. I heard you.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.500
Yeah, but she--

11:52.500 --> 11:54.100
We were having a private conversation.

11:54.100 --> 11:56.400
There are no private
conversations in high school.

11:56.600 --> 11:57.700
And i'm warning you,

11:58.100 --> 11:59.200
Show a little respect here.

11:59.300 --> 12:02.100
I am not one of your stupid
little football players.

12:04.100 --> 12:05.400
You better get in there, benjamin.

12:08.100 --> 12:08.900
You're not my coach.

12:08.900 --> 12:10.900
Amy, are you feeling
all right this morning?

12:10.900 --> 12:12.900
Were you up all night
with the baby? No sleep?

12:13.100 --> 12:16.700
Stupid football players? I don't
have any stupid football players.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.300
The stupid football players
maintain a b average.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.800
And everyone knows how
they maintain that b average.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.100
What?

12:23.900 --> 12:27.000
- Let me tell you something, little lady.
- Little lady?

12:27.400 --> 12:29.200
Don't you mean "little mommy"?

12:29.900 --> 12:31.900
You're prejudiced against me
because i'm a teen mother.

12:31.900 --> 12:33.600
- I am not.
- Then what is it?

12:33.800 --> 12:34.500
I'm a band geek.

12:34.500 --> 12:36.700
I don't have any problems with the band.

12:36.900 --> 12:39.400
But it is the football team
that keeps this school running.

12:39.500 --> 12:43.500
The money made at the concession stands at our
games paid for the landscaping at this school.

12:43.800 --> 12:46.000
And i'm sure you're right, sir.
Amy, can i just talk--

12:46.000 --> 12:48.400
Your games? Those are
our games too, you know.

12:48.700 --> 12:50.300
Are you disparaging the band?

12:50.400 --> 12:54.200
Because our band has won state competitions.
Your football team has never won state.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.600
Your football team's
our opening act.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.700
She's on crack, or something.

12:59.100 --> 13:01.800
Raging hormones are like crack.
Or at least, that's what i understand.

13:01.900 --> 13:04.400
If that's your way of
defending me, then step aside.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.700
Why don't we both step into my office?

13:07.500 --> 13:08.600
Office?

13:08.700 --> 13:12.200
???

13:36.600 --> 13:38.100
- Hey, stranger.
- Hi.

13:38.200 --> 13:39.300
How are your new friends?

13:39.400 --> 13:40.500
They're not new.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.200
- Does she know?
- Know what?

13:42.300 --> 13:43.400
You know what.

13:43.700 --> 13:44.800
About your dates.

13:44.900 --> 13:46.600
- Meetings.
- Whatever.

13:46.700 --> 13:47.500
Does she know?

13:47.500 --> 13:50.400
- Yeah, she-- Grace knows.
- Mm-Hm.

13:51.300 --> 13:52.300
Hi, lauren.

13:52.400 --> 13:53.700
- Hi.
- Could i?

13:57.100 --> 14:00.000
Look, madison, i know you don't
want to drive to school with jason,

14:00.200 --> 14:01.500
But i need some alone time with grace.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.600
I get it. I do.

14:04.500 --> 14:05.600
She's back.

14:06.200 --> 14:07.200
I'm out.

14:08.700 --> 14:11.100
Why does every guy i know
break up with me?

14:12.200 --> 14:13.200
Every guy?

14:14.300 --> 14:16.600
Um, not every guy.

14:17.200 --> 14:19.700
Except one guy that i dated. Jason.

14:21.100 --> 14:22.200
I have to go.

14:23.900 --> 14:25.300
I have to go, too.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.400
Whoa, where are you going?

14:33.700 --> 14:36.000
I think jack did something
with madison this summer.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.100
Doubt it.

14:37.200 --> 14:38.500
Guess who's getting
suspended from school?

14:38.500 --> 14:40.600
I hope jack, or madison.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.500
- Amy.
- What?

14:42.700 --> 14:45.400
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah. For calling me a slut.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.200
- But you--
- Don't say it.

14:47.300 --> 14:48.600
Unless you want to get suspended, too.

14:48.700 --> 14:49.800
What happened?

14:49.900 --> 14:54.400
My dad asked me to apologize because we're
going to be neighbors, and i agreed.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.400
I saw her. I went up to her
and i tried to apologize.

14:58.400 --> 15:00.700
I was so nice to her, it's crazy.

15:01.100 --> 15:03.700
I extended my hand to her,
and she spit in my face.

15:04.300 --> 15:06.600
Not literally. But she
called me a low-Class whore,

15:06.600 --> 15:08.300
Which is the same
as spitting in my face.

15:08.400 --> 15:09.700
You said she called you a slut.

15:09.800 --> 15:12.200
I know. I was just embellishing.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.500
And it's what she wanted to say.

15:14.700 --> 15:16.400
All because i held that stupid baby.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.100
- Adrian.
- What?

15:18.200 --> 15:20.400
You can't let amy get
suspended from school.

15:20.500 --> 15:21.600
Well, i can't help her now.

15:21.800 --> 15:23.300
She went off on coach.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Yeah.

15:25.100 --> 15:26.600
Because you got her upset.

15:26.700 --> 15:30.700
Because i implied that
her mother is a slut.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.700
I was just one-Upping
the conversation.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.700
Everyone knows that
if you get called a slut,

15:35.800 --> 15:38.100
The next step is to call
the other person's mother a slut.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.600
??? She took it so personally.

15:39.600 --> 15:42.000
Adrian, that is wrong.

15:42.100 --> 15:44.600
Who cares? Everyone's
a slut at some point.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.600
- Except me.
- Except you?

15:46.800 --> 15:48.400
Um, hello.

15:48.500 --> 15:49.800
I am not a slut.

15:49.900 --> 15:51.300
Madison's a slut.

15:51.400 --> 15:53.000
Oh, so she did tell you.

15:53.300 --> 15:54.500
I'm surprised.

15:55.200 --> 15:59.400
That she and my brother were-- Doing it.

15:59.600 --> 16:00.700
They weren't doing it.

16:00.900 --> 16:01.800
How do you know?

16:01.900 --> 16:03.700
Because jason told me they weren't.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.200
He and i got very close
this summer at med camp.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.500
He was just trying
to sleep with you.

16:09.600 --> 16:11.400
- He told me.
- He did not.

16:11.500 --> 16:14.500
Yes, he did. That's why madison--

16:17.100 --> 16:20.800
Madison went a little
crazy with him.

16:23.300 --> 16:27.000
And i'm not going to stand here gossiping
about my best friend and my brother.

16:32.500 --> 16:35.800
Jason told me he broke up with madison
because she wasn't serious about her studies.

16:35.800 --> 16:39.100
Yeah. Lots of couples
break up over that.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.400
Why do you think they broke up?

16:40.500 --> 16:41.600
Are you kidding me?

16:41.700 --> 16:43.100
Probably because of jack.

16:46.500 --> 16:47.900
I got to go.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.100
Hold it.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.600
Oh, hi. I didn't see you.

16:52.700 --> 16:55.600
You saw me. Are you insane?
You got amy suspended.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.900
I didn't do anything.
Amy got herself suspended.

16:57.900 --> 16:59.400
Well, you get her unsuspended.

16:59.500 --> 17:00.400
How am i supposed to do that?

17:00.400 --> 17:01.400
I don't know,

17:01.800 --> 17:04.900
But if you don't, i'm never going to
be able to let you around john again.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.200
Well, that's okay.

17:06.700 --> 17:08.500
It was nice holding him,
but it's not my kid.

17:08.500 --> 17:09.200
It's my kid.

17:09.300 --> 17:10.200
I know.

17:10.300 --> 17:12.500
And every night, after you
go over to amy's to see him,

17:12.500 --> 17:15.300
Then you can come over to my house
and we can have great sex.

17:15.400 --> 17:18.300
Adrian, i thought we were
serious about each other.

17:18.500 --> 17:21.700
I thought you and i were going to
start over and try to make things work.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.099
This isn't making things work.

17:24.200 --> 17:26.400
We can't be together if
you're not friends with amy.

17:26.400 --> 17:27.500
What?

17:28.300 --> 17:30.900
How can i be friends with
amy when she called me

17:30.900 --> 17:34.100
A no-Good, lying, cheating,
two-Bit low-Class whore?

17:34.200 --> 17:37.200
- What?
- Yeah. And then she spit in my face.

17:37.900 --> 17:38.900
Practically.

17:40.300 --> 17:41.800
You have to suspend me?

17:41.900 --> 17:42.800
What do you mean, have to?

17:42.800 --> 17:44.300
You called adrian a slut.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.000
And then you disrespected me.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.500
I know, but adrian is a slut,

17:47.500 --> 17:50.100
And i didn't know you were
anything more than a coach.

17:50.200 --> 17:51.400
I thought you were just the coach.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.100
You're not helping yourself.

17:54.100 --> 17:55.500
It's probably my mom.

17:58.100 --> 17:58.700
Hello?

17:58.700 --> 17:59.700
You're getting suspended?

17:59.700 --> 18:00.800
You want to talk to the coach?

18:00.800 --> 18:01.900
I'd love to.

18:04.900 --> 18:06.000
Hi, mrs. Juergens.

18:06.100 --> 18:09.800
I just want you to know that amy made
a disparaging remark to adrian,

18:09.900 --> 18:11.500
And when i tried to
talk to her about it,

18:11.600 --> 18:14.300
She made quite a few
disrespectful remarks to me,

18:14.500 --> 18:16.600
So i'm going to have to
suspend her for one day.

18:16.700 --> 18:18.900
We don't allow that
kind of behavior at school.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.400
I don't know and i don't care

18:20.400 --> 18:22.900
What kind of behavior
you allow in your home,

18:23.300 --> 18:25.800
But i don't allow that kind of
behavior at this school.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.200
What do you mean, what kind of
behavior i allow at home?

18:29.000 --> 18:32.500
Do you think i allow amy to be disrespectful
to me or her father in our own home?

18:33.600 --> 18:35.900
If you don't mind, i'd like to
talk to my daughter alone, please.

18:35.900 --> 18:37.000
Of course.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.100
Mom, adrian implied that you're a slut.

18:44.100 --> 18:45.500
That's why i got so upset.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.200
Who cares what adrian thinks?

18:47.300 --> 18:48.400
I have a date tonight.

18:49.900 --> 18:50.900
Aren't you excited?

18:51.000 --> 18:53.100
I just got suspended from school.

18:53.100 --> 18:55.600
Don't be so dramatic.
It's just one day.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.700
Listen, i'll meet you out in front
and we'll go to the mall

18:57.700 --> 18:59.400
Before i drop you off at the church nursery.

18:59.500 --> 19:02.000
- The mall?
- Yeah, i don't have anything to wear.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.700
Or anything that fits, anyway.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.600
Okay, so here's what i want you to do.

19:05.700 --> 19:06.700
Is the coach still there?

19:06.800 --> 19:08.700
He's waiting outside the office.

19:08.700 --> 19:10.500
Perfect. When you walk out of there,

19:10.700 --> 19:13.700
Just keep your head down, look ashamed
and head straight for the door.

19:13.800 --> 19:17.200
Aren't you supposed to be yelling at me
or something? What is wrong with you?

19:17.500 --> 19:18.700
I'm excited.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.900
He's an old friend, and he
used to be really cute.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.400
Go, go. I'm on my way.

19:37.900 --> 19:40.500
Uh, she's picking me up.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.300
And i'm sorry.

19:50.500 --> 19:51.700
You should be ashamed of yourself.

19:51.800 --> 19:53.200
Yeah, that'll happen.

19:53.200 --> 19:56.600
Apologize. Apologize to amy,
or i'm never coming near you again.

19:56.700 --> 19:59.700
I'll be near you whether
you come over again or not.

20:00.953 --> 20:03.053
I mean it ***

20:09.498 --> 20:10.486
I just think
he and Madison

20:10.486 --> 20:12.942
Were a little bit closer than
either one want to tell me.

20:12.942 --> 20:15.766
Honey, I think it was such a good
idea you invited Madison over.

20:15.766 --> 20:17.598
You don't want any enemies.

20:17.598 --> 20:18.776
She seems like a nice girl.

20:18.776 --> 20:22.190
She seems like it,
but I don't know.

20:22.866 --> 20:24.871
Maybe she and Jack
took advantage of the fact

20:24.871 --> 20:26.303
That Jason and I
were gone all summer.

20:26.303 --> 20:27.768
And you and Jason?

20:28.196 --> 20:29.708
You didn't get together
and talk all summer?

20:29.708 --> 20:31.008
That's all we did,
was talk.

20:31.008 --> 20:33.433
So why do you think Jack and
Madison did more than talk?

20:33.433 --> 20:34.116
I don't know.

20:34.116 --> 20:37.038
Grace, if you're going to be
in a relationship with someone,

20:37.038 --> 20:38.181
You have to trust them.

20:38.181 --> 20:39.461
And if you can't trust them,

20:39.461 --> 20:41.349
You shouldn't be
in a relationship with them.

20:42.169 --> 20:44.811
Yeah, well,
when I cheated on George,

20:44.811 --> 20:46.731
Neither of us
trusted each other.

20:47.669 --> 20:49.432
And that's when
most people cheat.

20:49.432 --> 20:50.411
When there's no trust.

20:50.411 --> 20:52.548
- This is not helping.
- You're right.

20:52.548 --> 20:55.034
You make your own decisions
when it comes to Jack.

20:55.493 --> 20:57.981
She always has.

20:59.112 --> 21:00.900
Where's my good buddy Jack?

21:00.900 --> 21:05.716
I thought Jack wanted to throw
the ball around this afternoon.

21:05.716 --> 21:08.384
Well, I didn't know if you
really wanted to do that.

21:08.384 --> 21:10.267
I want to do that.

21:10.267 --> 21:11.183
Okay.

21:11.183 --> 21:12.159
Do you, honey?

21:12.159 --> 21:15.366
A handy guy like that?
Of course.

21:15.754 --> 21:19.230
I want to throw the ball
around with Jack.

21:19.230 --> 21:20.528
When's he coming over here?

21:20.528 --> 21:23.211
I'll text him. He'll get the message
right after football practice.

21:23.211 --> 21:24.324
Call him now.

21:24.324 --> 21:27.126
I don't want to call him in case he has
his phone on when he's around the coach,

21:27.126 --> 21:29.168
Because the coach is in
a really bad mood today.

21:29.168 --> 21:35.909
Well, I hope the coach
is not mean to my buddy Jack.

21:37.377 --> 21:38.714
Should I text Jack?

21:38.714 --> 21:40.428
Yeah, why not?

21:40.428 --> 21:43.551
Plus, it'll give you a chance
to say whatever you want to say

21:43.551 --> 21:45.087
About whether or not
you trust him.

21:45.087 --> 21:46.118
All right.

21:46.641 --> 21:48.415
But do you really think
Tom's okay with Jack?

21:48.415 --> 21:51.327
If he's not, it'll give him
a chance to communicate.

21:52.283 --> 21:54.869
That's what everyone
needs to do, is communicate.

21:54.869 --> 21:57.597
Well, Amy was doing some
communicating today with the coach.

21:57.597 --> 21:59.396
That's what got him
in a bad mood,

21:59.396 --> 22:01.755
And that's what got her
suspended.

22:02.047 --> 22:03.156
Amy?

22:03.156 --> 22:05.736
I would like to see
the look on the coach's face.

22:05.736 --> 22:07.362
So Amy didn't cry, did she?

22:07.362 --> 22:10.146
Yeah, but I'm not sure if it was real
crying or just crying for sympathy.

22:10.146 --> 22:13.010
That Amy, wow. A year ago, she never
would have stood up for herself.

22:13.010 --> 22:14.050
Good for her.

22:14.454 --> 22:15.664
I wonder why your mother
didn't call me.

22:15.664 --> 22:16.722
She doesn't tell you
everything.

22:16.722 --> 22:18.005
I don't tell her
everything, either.

22:18.005 --> 22:19.135
I don't even tell you
everything.

22:19.135 --> 22:20.855
And obviously,
I don't tell you everything.

22:20.855 --> 22:22.131
And I'm fine with that.

22:23.050 --> 22:24.881
So she's dating, huh?
Your mom's dating?

22:25.513 --> 22:26.970
Man, who would
go out with a woman

22:26.970 --> 22:28.339
Who's in
her third trimester?

22:28.339 --> 22:29.176
I don't know.

22:29.176 --> 22:31.427
You didn't have anything
to do with this, did you? ***

22:31.427 --> 22:32.594
I might have.

22:33.225 --> 22:35.422
Well, what do you care?
You're dating anyway.

22:39.209 --> 22:40.788
Man, you have to
do something about Amy.

22:40.788 --> 22:43.030
She's losing it.
She got suspended.

22:43.219 --> 22:46.269
Is this the keep your woman
in line lecture?

22:46.269 --> 22:48.694
This is something that Amy and
Adrian are going to have to settle.

22:48.694 --> 22:52.021
I told Adrian to apologize. Her
father told her to apologize.

22:52.021 --> 22:55.293
It's good to know that you
can't keep your woman in line,

22:55.293 --> 22:56.541
And neither can her father.

22:56.541 --> 22:58.936
So how do you expect me
to control Amy?

22:59.236 --> 23:01.644
Oh, please.
Do go on, gentlemen.

23:01.644 --> 23:04.603
How is the best way to
control a woman? Tell me.

23:04.603 --> 23:06.472
I didn't mean
control. I just meant--

23:06.472 --> 23:08.633
- Yeah?
- Someone has to get through to Amy.

23:08.633 --> 23:11.705
Why, because Amy doesn't
have a mind of her own?

23:11.705 --> 23:15.470
Oh, no, no, no, no. Amy has
a mind of her own. Believe me.

23:15.878 --> 23:17.745
And so does Adrian.

23:17.745 --> 23:19.956
You want some advice,
the two of you?

23:21.048 --> 23:22.386
Get to work.

23:22.386 --> 23:24.147
Bunny, there's no one in here.

23:24.147 --> 23:25.576
It's the end of the day.

23:25.794 --> 23:28.915
You, like Amy and Adrian,
are a very strong woman.

23:29.474 --> 23:31.674
Couldn't you give us
some life advice?

23:31.674 --> 23:36.708
People who don't understand
cows shouldn't handle beef.

23:39.053 --> 23:45.457
Free range cattle are happy,
and provide a more tender cut.

23:51.030 --> 23:56.056
There's an old Yiddish saying which
I've changed a bit because I'm Irish.

23:56.380 --> 24:00.904
Whoever needs meat
is a slave to the cow.

24:03.117 --> 24:04.896
What are you, vegetarian?

24:06.909 --> 24:08.729
Good job asking Bunny for advice.

24:08.729 --> 24:09.905
Look, we got to do something.

24:09.905 --> 24:11.835
I don't want Amy and Adrian
to be enemies.

24:11.835 --> 24:13.172
It's going to make
our lives hell.

24:13.172 --> 24:14.723
How is it going to make
my life hell?

24:14.723 --> 24:16.931
If Amy won't let me
take John out of the house,

24:16.931 --> 24:20.274
Or if I can't baby-Sit because
she's afraid Adrian might come over,

24:20.274 --> 24:22.530
How are you ever
going to have sex with Amy?

24:22.998 --> 24:23.984
I'm not.

24:24.500 --> 24:25.712
I've given up on that.

24:26.148 --> 24:29.358
Yeah. Question is, why
have you given up on that?

24:36.754 --> 24:37.588
Why are you home so early?

24:37.588 --> 24:40.541
Oh, I got out of court early.

24:40.692 --> 24:43.544
Your mom's not coming in till
around 9, and I'm starving.

24:43.544 --> 24:44.713
Want to get
something to eat?

24:44.713 --> 24:47.226
Yeah, great. I'm starving too.

24:47.226 --> 24:50.354
How'd it go, at school?
How's it going with Amy?

24:50.354 --> 24:53.362
Just so you know,
I tried to apologize to her,

24:53.362 --> 24:56.018
And then she called me
some really terrible names

24:56.018 --> 24:59.316
That I won't repeat because I
know you hate words like that.

24:59.316 --> 25:01.550
And then, she mouthed off
to the football coach,

25:01.550 --> 25:03.677
Who is also the counselor,

25:03.677 --> 25:05.959
And he suspended her.

25:05.959 --> 25:08.156
But hey, you know what? I tried.

25:09.542 --> 25:12.448
Well, after we get
something to eat,

25:12.448 --> 25:15.132
Maybe we could go by her house
and you could try again.

25:15.132 --> 25:16.517
- What?
- Yeah.

25:16.517 --> 25:18.045
Coach called.

25:18.045 --> 25:20.044
He said in talking
to Amy and her mother,

25:20.044 --> 25:22.621
He felt that he had just heard
the end of the conversation,

25:22.621 --> 25:25.575
And that perhaps you
had instigated the problem.

25:25.575 --> 25:26.897
And he wasn't
going to suspend you,

25:26.897 --> 25:28.658
But he doesn't want
any more trouble at school.

25:28.658 --> 25:29.701
I'm not hungry.

25:29.701 --> 25:32.387
Okay. Well, we could
go by Amy's first,

25:32.387 --> 25:35.405
And then maybe after
you've cleared the air,

25:35.405 --> 25:37.162
You'll feel more like
a bite to eat.

25:37.162 --> 25:38.370
Or not.

25:38.370 --> 25:39.827
How'd you let this
happen, huh?

25:39.902 --> 25:41.345
You want to be
a prosecutor one day?

25:41.345 --> 25:42.544
You want to do what I do?

25:42.646 --> 25:45.222
Then you have to learn
to keep a public face.

25:45.222 --> 25:46.522
You get along with everyone,

25:46.522 --> 25:48.545
Because getting along
is to your benefit.

25:48.545 --> 25:49.921
Then I'll do something else.

25:49.921 --> 25:51.274
I don't have to do
what you do.

25:51.274 --> 25:52.737
What are you going to do
that doesn't require

25:52.737 --> 25:53.985
Getting along
with other people?

25:53.985 --> 25:55.274
Undertaker?

25:55.704 --> 25:58.184
Look, I can't, okay?
I just can't.

25:58.184 --> 26:00.649
I'm not good at getting along
with people I don't like.

26:00.649 --> 26:02.236
You've got to change
your attitude.

26:02.236 --> 26:03.453
To what?

26:03.453 --> 26:05.348
We'll discuss it over food.

26:05.380 --> 26:06.549
Let's go.

26:11.807 --> 26:13.120
Look, I'm sorry
about this morning.

26:13.120 --> 26:14.847
I didn't know you wanted
to fix the cabinet.

26:16.090 --> 26:17.505
I didn't mean to step
on your toes, buddy.

26:17.505 --> 26:18.475
Sure.

26:18.475 --> 26:20.043
Okay. Let's play some ball.

26:20.043 --> 26:22.188
Now the most important thing
when throwing a football

26:22.188 --> 26:23.536
Is the follow through.

26:23.877 --> 26:26.388
You have to shift your weight
from the back to the front

26:26.388 --> 26:27.912
And follow through
on the release.

26:27.912 --> 26:29.237
So shift your weight,

26:29.389 --> 26:31.015
Release, and follow through.

26:31.015 --> 26:33.091
You need to release
and follow through like this.

26:34.308 --> 26:36.988
All right, now there's no such
thing as too much follow through.

26:36.988 --> 26:38.655
Release and follow through.

26:38.655 --> 26:39.745
I got it.

26:39.745 --> 26:41.696
- Release and follow through.
- I got it.

26:41.696 --> 26:42.872
Just making sure, buddy.

26:42.872 --> 26:45.376
Yeah. Thanks, buddy.

26:45.376 --> 26:47.408
- Fingers on laces.
- Okay.

26:47.408 --> 26:48.835
Release and follow through.

26:48.835 --> 26:49.714
Okay.

26:52.698 --> 26:54.235
Think fast.

27:06.668 --> 27:09.251
Groin injury. Get the ice.

27:09.323 --> 27:11.327
I don't think so.

27:13.272 --> 27:16.857
How was that, buddy?
Enough follow through?

27:48.553 --> 27:50.618
Maybe he needs
to go to the hospital.

27:53.710 --> 27:54.834
Maybe.

27:59.314 --> 28:00.492
How do I look?

28:01.417 --> 28:03.003
You look nice.

28:03.003 --> 28:06.707
You look very pregnant.

28:07.143 --> 28:08.705
Did Amy pick that?

28:08.705 --> 28:10.881
Ashley, I don't think that I
could look anything but pregnant.

28:10.881 --> 28:13.105
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

28:13.372 --> 28:14.662
You want me to go with you?

28:14.662 --> 28:15.863
On my date?

28:15.863 --> 28:16.959
Well, I could.

28:16.959 --> 28:20.391
You were the one who said I should
get out more before the baby gets here.

28:20.391 --> 28:22.826
You're the who said that I
should call an old friend.

28:22.826 --> 28:25.887
You're right. I did say that.

28:26.321 --> 28:29.560
But-- Okay, just remember
to bring your cell phone

28:29.560 --> 28:32.666
So you can call in case
your friend's some weirdo.

28:32.666 --> 28:35.107
And who am I going to call
if he ends up being a weirdo?

28:35.107 --> 28:37.979
Your dad? Won't he be out
on his own date?

28:37.979 --> 28:40.547
Yeah, I guess, but you know
Amy and I can't drive.

28:40.547 --> 28:41.454
I'll be fine.

28:41.454 --> 28:43.509
Did you Google
this old friend of yours?

28:43.509 --> 28:45.804
No, I didn't Google him.

28:45.804 --> 28:47.593
I just want to have
a meal with him.

28:47.740 --> 28:49.045
I talked to him
on the phone,

28:49.045 --> 28:51.366
And he still has
that same sense of humor

28:51.366 --> 28:53.346
That he had when we were
in school together.

28:54.121 --> 28:56.942
A little juvenile,
but he's a fun guy.

28:58.025 --> 28:59.011
Good night.

28:59.011 --> 29:01.853
Good night, John.
Good night.

29:05.964 --> 29:07.647
Why would my mother
listen to me?

29:09.682 --> 29:13.115
Right. No one listens to me.

29:21.631 --> 29:23.764
You better hurry up.
That kid's getting hungry.

29:24.394 --> 29:25.942
I've had a bad day,
all right?

29:26.186 --> 29:27.617
Yeah, it's all right
with me.

29:30.133 --> 29:32.847
You know what? I hope Mom
has a great time on her date,

29:32.847 --> 29:35.199
And I hope Dad has a great
time on his date, too.

29:35.199 --> 29:39.666
And I hope that you realize
that you're responsible

29:39.666 --> 29:41.181
If our parents
don't get back together,

29:41.181 --> 29:42.712
Even though
they're having a baby.

29:43.301 --> 29:44.343
What were you thinking?

29:44.343 --> 29:45.673
What are you
yelling at me for?

29:45.673 --> 29:47.688
I know you don't want us
to move back in here.

29:47.688 --> 29:51.572
No, I don't, because I don't want
that slut to move in next door.

29:58.984 --> 30:00.367
Hi. Can I come in?

30:00.367 --> 30:02.209
I don't know. What do you want?

30:02.209 --> 30:03.633
I want to apologize
to you again.

30:03.633 --> 30:06.168
Go ahead. Hope you do a better
job than you did last time.

30:06.168 --> 30:07.505
Me too.

30:08.161 --> 30:09.049
All right, look, Amy.

30:09.049 --> 30:11.200
I'm really sorry
you called me a slut

30:11.200 --> 30:12.537
And got suspended
from school.

30:12.537 --> 30:14.361
That's your idea
of an apology?

30:14.361 --> 30:15.844
I'm not finished.

30:15.844 --> 30:18.205
I'm also really sorry
that you're totally insecure,

30:18.205 --> 30:19.507
Selfish and naive.

30:19.507 --> 30:20.799
Is that right?

30:21.172 --> 30:24.388
Well, I'm sorry
that you're a slut,

30:24.388 --> 30:27.270
A slut and a slut.

30:27.270 --> 30:29.240
I'm not, because being a slut

30:29.240 --> 30:31.640
Is going to keep Ricky
interested in me and not you.

30:31.640 --> 30:34.019
Aren't you being insecure?

30:34.659 --> 30:36.543
If sex is so great with you,

30:36.543 --> 30:37.723
Then why are you so afraid

30:37.723 --> 30:39.417
That Ricky
will be interested in me?

30:40.124 --> 30:42.312
Maybe having a baby together

30:42.312 --> 30:43.635
Gives Ricky and I
a deeper bond

30:43.635 --> 30:44.869
Than you'll ever have
with him,

30:44.869 --> 30:46.687
Just because the two of you
are having sex.

30:46.687 --> 30:48.262
That's an interesting point.

30:48.262 --> 30:50.666
I think I might discuss that
with my friend Ben.

30:51.346 --> 30:52.467
You know, in the long run,

30:52.467 --> 30:55.604
While Ricky may love his son, he's
probably never going to love you,

30:55.604 --> 30:58.508
Because you ruined his life.

30:59.318 --> 31:00.448
Good night.

31:01.017 --> 31:05.235
Oh, and again, I'm sorry.

31:11.309 --> 31:12.550
Way to go.

31:13.130 --> 31:14.604
You told her off.

31:14.604 --> 31:15.398
I hate her.

31:15.398 --> 31:16.950
I think she hates you, too.

31:16.950 --> 31:19.121
Ashley, we cannot let her
family move into Dad's house.

31:19.121 --> 31:20.881
What are we
supposed to do, Amy?

31:20.881 --> 31:23.249
He can't take the house back
now. She's already moving in.

31:23.249 --> 31:25.728
He can't move over here.
He's dating.

31:25.728 --> 31:26.961
So is Mom.

31:28.108 --> 31:29.910
I thought it would help
even things out.

31:31.553 --> 31:33.310
You know, I think maybe
they should get back together

31:33.310 --> 31:35.190
Before the baby comes,
or the baby will just be--

31:35.190 --> 31:36.881
The baby will just
be what, Ashley?

31:36.881 --> 31:37.850
Nothing.

31:39.381 --> 31:40.921
Look, I'm really sorry.

31:41.700 --> 31:45.280
I almost attached some stigma to the
baby not having parents who were married.

31:45.280 --> 31:47.912
And of course,
the baby can't help that.

31:47.912 --> 31:50.260
But maybe the parents can.

31:51.395 --> 31:52.453
I really am sorry.

31:52.453 --> 31:53.685
No, you're right.

31:54.420 --> 31:55.891
I do get that a lot.

31:56.352 --> 31:58.203
People ask me
if I'm married all the time.

31:58.788 --> 32:00.380
And I have to say no.

32:00.380 --> 32:02.194
I'm just a teenager.

32:03.131 --> 32:06.890
But the looks on their faces
are always the same.

32:07.263 --> 32:08.526
Poor baby.

32:08.526 --> 32:09.437
Amy.

32:09.437 --> 32:10.673
I wish I could get married.

32:10.673 --> 32:12.280
To Ben, right?

32:13.564 --> 32:14.734
I'm going to take
this opportunity

32:14.734 --> 32:16.063
While Betty's
in the ladies' room

32:16.063 --> 32:18.546
To tell you you got
some mail today.

32:21.463 --> 32:24.384
Uh, I don't even read
or speak Italian.

32:24.384 --> 32:26.299
Are you telling me
you learned nothing over there?

32:26.299 --> 32:27.890
Are you still referring
to the language?

32:27.890 --> 32:31.427
Yeah, because if you learned
anything about sex over there,

32:31.427 --> 32:32.450
I don't want to know about it.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.338
And you know who else
doesn't want to know about it?

32:34.338 --> 32:35.370
Amy.

32:35.370 --> 32:36.992
So if you had sex this summer,

32:36.992 --> 32:38.637
That's your little secret,

32:38.637 --> 32:40.353
And you don't want
to tell anyone.

32:40.353 --> 32:41.706
Not anyone.

32:41.706 --> 32:45.212
I haven't told anything
to anyone about anything.

32:45.212 --> 32:46.308
Good.

32:46.308 --> 32:48.507
Someone didn't happen to say
that I had sex with them

32:48.507 --> 32:51.059
-This sumer in the postcard, did they?
- No.

32:51.059 --> 32:53.918
All right, well then,
could you possibly read this

32:53.918 --> 32:55.321
And tell me what it says?

32:55.866 --> 32:56.816
Later.

32:59.784 --> 33:02.187
Oh, I love the restrooms here.

33:02.572 --> 33:05.462
The cloth towels
are so classy.

33:06.126 --> 33:07.918
Hey, Betty. Leo.

33:07.918 --> 33:08.814
Hi.

33:10.538 --> 33:11.916
We're regulars.

33:11.916 --> 33:14.108
I've never been regular.

33:14.383 --> 33:15.898
Makes me feel so special.

33:15.898 --> 33:17.298
You are special.

33:17.298 --> 33:19.226
And you're special too.

33:23.448 --> 33:24.674
And you're a special kid.

33:24.674 --> 33:25.922
Thanks, Betty.

33:31.495 --> 33:32.481
Ben.

33:33.404 --> 33:35.399
Did you want to tell me
that I'm special?

33:35.399 --> 33:36.591
Oh, of course.

33:36.987 --> 33:40.772
And you're a very special
stepmother.

33:40.772 --> 33:43.668
I don't know if I'm
comfortable with that term.

33:44.068 --> 33:45.779
Stepmother.

33:46.152 --> 33:48.474
I don't think
it really suits me.

33:48.970 --> 33:50.121
Do you think?

33:53.498 --> 33:57.713
Uh, maybe I could call you Mom.

33:58.017 --> 34:01.148
I don't think my mother
would mind if I called you Mom.

34:01.148 --> 34:03.091
I'd do that, if that's
what you and Dad want.

34:03.091 --> 34:08.507
Oh, yeah, I don't know if I'm
comfortable with Mom, either.

34:08.896 --> 34:10.994
I don't like labels.

34:11.495 --> 34:13.074
I know.

34:13.074 --> 34:16.003
How about you call me Betty?

34:16.737 --> 34:18.400
I can do that, Betty.

34:18.670 --> 34:21.744
But I mean,
you're not just that.

34:21.744 --> 34:25.194
You're Betty,
the woman my dad adores.

34:25.194 --> 34:28.339
You know, I can tell you
learned something in Bologna.

34:30.010 --> 34:31.402
Uh, I guess.

34:31.402 --> 34:33.027
You learned
how to talk to women.

34:33.187 --> 34:33.967
I can tell.

34:33.967 --> 34:35.991
-You can?
-Yeah.

34:36.942 --> 34:39.710
And I can tell you learned
when not to talk,

34:40.101 --> 34:42.590
And that is very important.

34:43.147 --> 34:44.958
You're a real gentleman.

34:46.369 --> 34:49.588
A woman doesn't always need
to know every little thing.

34:50.170 --> 34:51.650
You know what I'm saying?

34:51.650 --> 34:52.884
I do.

34:54.483 --> 34:58.090
Some things are just
between friends.

35:04.787 --> 35:05.777
Yeah.

35:05.777 --> 35:08.882
I guess apologizing to Amy
really did make you feel better.

35:08.882 --> 35:12.277
Yeah. It made me feel inspired.

35:12.277 --> 35:13.733
You did apologize?

35:13.733 --> 35:15.989
I said I'm sorry over and over,

35:15.989 --> 35:19.109
And we came to a new
understanding, Amy and I.

35:19.109 --> 35:21.004
Well, good.
Thank you, Adrian.

35:21.004 --> 35:22.908
No. Thank you.

35:22.908 --> 35:26.038
Of course, now I'm too
tired to go over there.

35:26.038 --> 35:26.902
Sorry.

35:27.645 --> 35:30.437
It's okay. I rarely miss going
over there. She'll understand.

35:30.437 --> 35:31.758
Of course she will.

35:31.758 --> 35:35.513
Tell me the truth. Did Ben
tell you he had sex this summer?

35:37.797 --> 35:38.612
Did he?

35:38.612 --> 35:40.764
I'm asking you.
He didn't tell me if he did.

35:40.764 --> 35:41.957
I don't know.

35:42.828 --> 35:44.021
You wouldn't lie to me?

35:44.021 --> 35:45.124
Would you lie to me?

35:45.124 --> 35:47.436
One step forward,
two steps back.

35:47.436 --> 35:49.245
- Why two--
- Nothing.

35:49.245 --> 35:51.900
Something my shrink
says to me once in a while.

35:56.105 --> 35:57.068
Amy.

35:57.084 --> 35:58.971
I'll just get this
over with.

36:01.235 --> 36:02.170
Hi, Amy.

36:02.170 --> 36:03.987
You don't have to come over.

36:03.987 --> 36:06.874
Ashley put John to bed
earlier, and he's fine.

36:06.874 --> 36:09.810
You can come over if you want,
but you don't have to.

36:09.810 --> 36:12.610
I want to, but I've got
a test to study for,

36:12.610 --> 36:14.537
<i>So thanks, Amy,
thanks for letting me know.</i>

36:14.537 --> 36:16.410
What test are you
studying for?

36:16.410 --> 36:17.865
Just a test.

36:17.865 --> 36:20.786
By the way, I'm really sorry about
what happened at school today.

36:20.786 --> 36:22.540
Adrian told me
she apologized.

36:22.540 --> 36:23.813
Adrian told you that when?

36:23.813 --> 36:25.831
-When?
-Yeah, when?

36:25.831 --> 36:28.904
She apologized at school and
then she apologized again tonight.

36:28.904 --> 36:31.832
<i>The second apology was no
better than the first apology.</i>

36:31.832 --> 36:32.839
What?

36:32.839 --> 36:35.494
I don't want Adrian
anywhere near John.

36:35.494 --> 36:38.904
And if you're going
to stay around Adrian,

36:38.904 --> 36:41.540
Then I'm afraid I don't
want you around John.

36:41.540 --> 36:44.879
Well, Amy, I could get a lawyer
and establish my rights in court.

36:44.879 --> 36:46.859
That's right, I have rights
as John's father.

36:46.859 --> 36:49.810
It's not fair.
It's not fair.

36:49.810 --> 36:51.993
I'm his mother.
I do all the hard stuff.

36:51.993 --> 36:54.508
I don't want you and Adrian
just to take our son out

36:54.508 --> 36:57.044
And have a good time while I'm
at home doing all the hard work.

36:57.044 --> 36:59.523
Is that it, Amy, or is there
something else going on here?

36:59.523 --> 37:00.803
I don't know.

37:01.587 --> 37:03.293
What do you mean,
something else?

37:03.293 --> 37:07.357
I mean, if Adrian was not
around and Ben was not around,

37:07.357 --> 37:09.735
Do you think we might ever
have a shot at a relationship?

37:09.735 --> 37:10.681
I love Ben.

37:10.681 --> 37:11.627
I love Adrian.

37:11.627 --> 37:13.205
I don't tell her that,
but I do.

37:13.205 --> 37:14.415
I can trust Ben.

37:14.415 --> 37:15.941
Are you saying
you can't trust me?

37:15.941 --> 37:18.564
Yeah. I would never want
to be with a guy

37:18.564 --> 37:20.741
Who cannot
be faithful to me.

37:21.606 --> 37:24.901
So maybe Ben
is the right person for me,

37:24.901 --> 37:27.324
And Adrian
is the right person for you.

37:27.324 --> 37:28.371
Maybe.

37:29.485 --> 37:31.301
People aren't perfect, Amy.

37:31.301 --> 37:33.144
- Good night, Ricky.
- ***

37:50.608 --> 37:52.531
I hope you've been
at Amy's all this time.

37:52.858 --> 37:55.098
Not all this time,
but yes, I was at Amy's.

37:55.098 --> 37:56.339
Adrian, it's a school night.

37:56.339 --> 37:58.130
You don't need to be out
this late on a school night.

37:58.130 --> 38:00.826
When we move into our new
house and Ricky comes to see me,

38:00.826 --> 38:02.049
Then I won't be out
this late.

38:02.049 --> 38:03.105
So you were at Ricky's?

38:03.105 --> 38:04.338
After I was at Amy's.

38:04.338 --> 38:06.464
So I take it that
if you're still seeing Ricky,

38:06.464 --> 38:08.286
That everything
went well at Amy's?

38:08.950 --> 38:11.603
Or you lied about
how things went at Amy's.

38:11.603 --> 38:12.990
You are good.

38:12.990 --> 38:14.384
And you are bad.

38:14.384 --> 38:15.555
What happened at Amy's?

38:15.555 --> 38:16.890
Why can't you just
take my side?

38:16.890 --> 38:17.908
Oh, Adrian.

38:17.908 --> 38:18.927
You're my dad.

38:18.927 --> 38:21.005
That's what I need you for,
to stand by me.

38:21.005 --> 38:23.381
I'll do that when you're right
and everybody else is wrong.

38:23.381 --> 38:24.437
What does that mean?

38:24.437 --> 38:25.792
That means that until then,

38:25.792 --> 38:27.424
I'm not going
to just stand by you

38:27.424 --> 38:29.080
When you keep doing
the wrong thing.

38:29.080 --> 38:31.415
I'm trying to get you
to do the right thing.

38:31.415 --> 38:32.496
All right.

38:32.496 --> 38:33.550
All right what?

38:33.550 --> 38:35.335
I didn't do anything wrong.

38:35.335 --> 38:37.554
At least, not until you
tried to make me apologize.

38:37.554 --> 38:40.179
The bigger picture, Adrian.
Look at the bigger picture.

38:40.179 --> 38:43.530
You're about to move in next door to
the mother of your boyfriend's child.

38:43.530 --> 38:46.217
Now, it is important
that everyone gets along.

38:46.217 --> 38:47.986
That's the bigger picture.

38:47.986 --> 38:49.363
Not who's right
and who's wrong,

38:49.363 --> 38:51.040
But that everyone
get along.

38:51.040 --> 38:52.441
You've made a career

38:52.441 --> 38:54.931
Out of who's right and
who's wrong, haven't you?

38:55.463 --> 38:57.351
You ever tell a guy
that got mugged

38:57.351 --> 39:00.955
That it was his fault and he just
has to get along with the mugger?

39:01.913 --> 39:04.191
No. Of course not.

39:06.721 --> 39:08.432
Wow, I'm going to be a really
good attorney, aren't I?

39:08.432 --> 39:10.754
I want you to be
a really good person first,

39:10.754 --> 39:11.833
And then a good attorney.

39:11.833 --> 39:13.594
I am a really good person.

39:13.926 --> 39:15.952
I just hate Amy Juergens.

39:16.337 --> 39:17.728
And you know what else?

39:18.059 --> 39:20.227
I'm an honest person
for saying that.

39:21.839 --> 39:22.784
Good night.

39:25.699 --> 39:27.991
If I had any hair,
it'd be grey by now.

39:27.991 --> 39:29.167
Love you.

39:30.194 --> 39:32.749
Yeah. Love you, too.

39:34.560 --> 39:36.608
Now, if you're still in the
fetal position in the morning,

39:36.608 --> 39:39.571
I'm going to have to insist
you go to the emergency room.

39:39.632 --> 39:40.699
I'll be okay.

39:40.699 --> 39:41.970
I hope so.

39:41.970 --> 39:43.730
And I hope we're okay.

39:44.970 --> 39:48.642
Even if you did have some
momentary indiscretion

39:48.642 --> 39:52.154
With Madison last summer,
I'll get over it.

39:52.154 --> 39:55.364
And even if you have some sort
of future physical dysfunction

39:55.364 --> 39:57.140
Because of this little
football mishap,

39:57.140 --> 39:59.107
I'll still marry you, Jack.

39:59.107 --> 39:59.727
Promise.

39:59.727 --> 40:02.026
Is that a possibility?
Dysfunction?

40:02.026 --> 40:05.032
As your future doctor, I just have to
inform you of the worst case scenario.

40:05.032 --> 40:06.946
But hey,
you'll probably be fine.

40:08.189 --> 40:09.136
Good night.

40:10.407 --> 40:11.448
I love you.

40:17.884 --> 40:21.616
And remember,
if you marry Grace,

40:21.616 --> 40:24.337
You marry me, buddy.

40:28.964 --> 40:31.895
I just want to say that I didn't
handle things well in the hallway today.

40:31.895 --> 40:34.274
I was just so afraid
for you to get in trouble,

40:34.274 --> 40:35.820
But you know what?

40:35.820 --> 40:36.952
You were amazing,

40:36.952 --> 40:38.711
Standing up for yourself
like that.

40:38.711 --> 40:41.335
Oh, thanks.

40:41.865 --> 40:43.853
I thought I made a complete
idiot out of myself.

40:43.853 --> 40:45.669
No. Are you kidding?

40:45.669 --> 40:47.966
You were a force of nature.

40:48.426 --> 40:50.331
-You think?
-Yeah, sure.

40:50.331 --> 40:51.191
I cried.

40:51.191 --> 40:53.159
Everyone thinks
you did that on purpose.

40:53.159 --> 40:54.543
- Really?
- Really.

40:54.543 --> 40:56.160
-Well, I didn't.
-Doesn't matter.

40:56.160 --> 40:57.243
That's what people think.

40:57.243 --> 40:58.386
What else do people think?

40:58.386 --> 40:59.330
About you?

41:00.002 --> 41:02.130
Well, they think
you're pretty amazing.

41:02.994 --> 41:04.304
I mean, you stayed in school.

41:04.635 --> 41:06.552
You didn't run away
when you got pregnant.

41:06.552 --> 41:09.767
You just held your head
up high and stuck it out,

41:09.767 --> 41:13.513
And now you're managing to work
and go to school and be a mom.

41:13.513 --> 41:14.697
Oh, speaking of which,

41:14.697 --> 41:16.761
I love the way
you're so protective of John.

41:16.761 --> 41:19.024
Not that Adrian
would really hurt him.

41:19.024 --> 41:20.294
What does that mean?

41:20.294 --> 41:24.631
It means that you're
such an amazing person

41:24.631 --> 41:27.495
That I bet you'll find a way
to work things out with Adrian.

41:27.495 --> 41:29.271
Just because
you're a better person.

41:29.271 --> 41:30.466
I hate Adrian.

41:30.466 --> 41:32.514
Come on, Amy,
you don't hate anybody.

41:32.514 --> 41:34.034
Yes, I do. I hate Adrian.

41:34.034 --> 41:36.041
And I hate
that you talk to her.

41:36.320 --> 41:37.834
What, were you just
buttering me up

41:37.834 --> 41:39.369
So I'd be friends
with your new friend?

41:39.369 --> 41:40.849
Is that why I'm so amazing?

41:40.849 --> 41:43.328
No, that's not why.

41:43.473 --> 41:45.020
And I'm sorry
if I said anything wrong.

41:45.020 --> 41:47.423
I just wanted to tell you
how wonderful you are

41:47.423 --> 41:49.032
Before I went to sleep.

41:49.566 --> 41:50.491
I love you.

41:50.491 --> 41:53.404
Thanks. Love you too.
Good night.

42:03.780 --> 42:05.256
So you going
to invite me in, milady?

42:05.256 --> 42:07.689
A little spot of tea
and thee, perhaps?

42:07.689 --> 42:09.181
I don't think so,

42:09.421 --> 42:11.688
But I did have
a really great time.

42:15.012 --> 42:15.782
Hi.

42:17.657 --> 42:19.621
Surprise.

42:20.577 --> 42:21.698
What were you doing up?

42:21.698 --> 42:22.900
Were you waiting up for me?

42:22.900 --> 42:26.607
I just wanted to see
how your date went.

42:27.434 --> 42:29.053
Dad, is your--

42:30.016 --> 42:31.470
You're his date?

42:31.470 --> 42:33.422
Yeah, and it went
really well.

42:33.422 --> 42:34.655
Think I might get lucky.

42:34.655 --> 42:36.712
I don't think so.

42:36.712 --> 42:38.659
Don't talk that way
in front of your daughter.

42:38.659 --> 42:39.990
What about
in front of my son?

42:39.990 --> 42:40.984
Son?

42:41.579 --> 42:42.740
So we're getting a brother?

42:42.740 --> 42:44.973
Yup. It's a boy.

42:44.973 --> 42:46.388
We have
two perfect daughters,

42:46.388 --> 42:49.203
And now we're having a son.

42:51.998 --> 42:53.052
What did I miss?

42:54.212 --> 42:55.080
Nothing.
