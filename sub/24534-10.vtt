02:12.250 --> 02:13.706
Anybody home?

08:11.740 --> 08:13.776
Whoever's in here,

08:15.910 --> 08:18.231
get the hell out, or I'll kill you.

08:23.330 --> 08:24.740
You got one chance.

08:33.470 --> 08:34.539
Okay.

08:39.970 --> 08:42.018
I just wanted to be left alone.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.470
You should have left me alone.

09:06.210 --> 09:07.666
Why are you here?

09:10.630 --> 09:12.757
Did you follow me?

09:17.430 --> 09:19.466
You can't be here.

09:20.180 --> 09:21.511
You can't be here.

10:01.850 --> 10:03.511
No! No!

10:04.220 --> 10:05.676
No!

11:01.700 --> 11:04.908
Why did you bring me back here?
Why did you do that?

11:06.910 --> 11:08.241
I know you're in there!

11:09.330 --> 11:11.628
Why won't you just say something?

11:18.380 --> 11:21.122
All right. If you're not gonna talk,
then listen.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.170
My mom died saving me.

11:31.690 --> 11:34.397
Saving Nick, saving everyone.

11:37.900 --> 11:40.949
Because you led Mel and Ennis
to the place we built.

11:42.570 --> 11:44.231
Because you lied to us.

11:51.420 --> 11:53.206
And then you shot my brother.

11:57.670 --> 12:00.002
And I watched him bleed to death.

12:01.470 --> 12:02.539
And I...

12:04.090 --> 12:06.638
I couldn't do anything but watch him die.

12:08.850 --> 12:11.136
Watch him realize he was going to die.

12:14.060 --> 12:15.607
And it didn't happen fast.

12:16.440 --> 12:18.647
He was aware. He was in pain.

12:18.730 --> 12:20.561
He knew you did it.

12:22.450 --> 12:26.773
He knew the person
he tried to save killed him.

12:27.910 --> 12:32.028
And maybe that made him feel like
his life didn't mean anything.

12:36.420 --> 12:38.741
I can't send you out there!

12:40.210 --> 12:42.417
But if you're in this house with me,

12:42.510 --> 12:43.966
then I'll probably kill you.

12:45.340 --> 12:46.887
I don't know if I want to kill you.

12:46.970 --> 12:49.302
I just know I probably will.

12:56.520 --> 12:57.896
I'm trying to be like my mom.

12:57.980 --> 13:02.064
I'm trying to believe what she believed,
do what she did.

13:02.150 --> 13:04.277
Because that's all I have left of her.

13:04.360 --> 13:07.238
That's the only thing
that keeps her alive.

13:09.910 --> 13:10.786
IfI kill...

13:11.500 --> 13:12.944
IfI kill you...

13:17.000 --> 13:19.798
I won't let you take that
away from me again.

13:35.810 --> 13:37.550
You may be a kid, Charlie.

13:41.110 --> 13:42.816
But you know what you did.

13:45.030 --> 13:46.770
And that makes you garbage.

13:48.200 --> 13:51.021
It makes you a waste of a person.

13:53.040 --> 13:58.034
Worse than something stumbling around
out there tearing into people.

13:59.460 --> 14:02.702
See, I hope you live to a ripe old age

14:03.880 --> 14:06.622
so you have to remember what you did.

14:09.640 --> 14:12.052
What you did, who you are...

14:13.930 --> 14:16.888
And how you can never, ever...

14:19.650 --> 14:21.561
make up for it.

16:27.610 --> 16:29.100
Why did you cover them?

16:31.700 --> 16:33.486
Why won't you say anything?

16:42.410 --> 16:44.287
Did you know these people or something?

16:47.420 --> 16:49.741
I put them out there for a reason.

16:49.840 --> 16:52.502
Come downstairs. Grab your coat.

17:02.680 --> 17:03.886
Hold steady!

17:08.480 --> 17:09.606
Good.

17:09.690 --> 17:11.100
Next one.

17:31.210 --> 17:32.837
We're making too much noise.

17:38.430 --> 17:39.545
Get inside.

17:51.820 --> 17:56.234
We'll try again later,
when there's a break in the storm.

17:57.070 --> 17:59.197
When the dead start to clear out.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.137
Give me your coat.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.050
I'm trying to do the right thing here.

18:25.390 --> 18:27.597
Once I get this started,
I can use the fire to dry it.

18:32.900 --> 18:36.438
Give me your coat.
Then you can go upstairs.

18:45.410 --> 18:47.037
Give me your coat.

18:48.080 --> 18:49.820
Give me your coat!

19:09.480 --> 19:11.095
Is this the same gun you...

19:26.120 --> 19:28.076
I told you you couldn't be here.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.206
I told you I didn't want to be around you.

19:38.340 --> 19:40.080
Did you come here to kill me?

19:41.090 --> 19:42.330
Is that it?

19:42.890 --> 19:44.596
Get me before I could get you?

19:45.220 --> 19:47.176
You expect me to believe that?

19:53.100 --> 19:54.647
Get out of here. Go.

20:32.810 --> 20:34.391
I'm sorry.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.309
I'm trying.

22:06.610 --> 22:07.736
Charlie!

22:22.880 --> 22:24.416
This wasn't for me, was it?

22:25.920 --> 22:27.217
It was for you.

22:35.390 --> 22:37.881
Everyone's telling me
all the reasons to keep going.

22:39.020 --> 22:41.762
But I think you and I both know
that's not the deal.

22:44.070 --> 22:46.061
There are no good reasons.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.270
I think you might've had the right idea.

22:55.950 --> 22:58.453
But that doesn't mean
I'm gonna let you do It.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.456
Why did you save me?

23:11.680 --> 23:13.750
Was it because you wanted me
to live with it?

23:15.100 --> 23:16.306
What I did?

23:18.020 --> 23:19.226
I don't know.

23:21.020 --> 23:23.056
But yeah, you're gonna
have to live with it.

23:24.480 --> 23:26.436
You don't get off the hook that easy.

23:27.990 --> 23:29.696
What did you think I was gonna say?

23:29.780 --> 23:32.271
I saved you because
I see something in you?

23:33.950 --> 23:36.783
Because I forgive you
for what you did to my family?

23:36.870 --> 23:39.077
I'm not gonna say that. It's not true.

23:40.750 --> 23:42.286
I can't help you.

23:43.540 --> 23:46.122
So whatever it is you're looking for,
you're not gonna get it.

23:46.210 --> 23:47.700
Not from me.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.886
You have to live with what you've done.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.919
Just like I have.

24:00.100 --> 24:02.182
Even if all that's waiting for you
on the other end

24:02.270 --> 24:03.976
is being out on that porch just like them.

24:19.330 --> 24:21.457
How long do you think
the storm is gonna last?

24:22.370 --> 24:24.031
Hell ifI know.

24:24.920 --> 24:27.036
I'm from California.

24:31.380 --> 24:33.086
Get up. We're gonna eat.

25:16.340 --> 25:17.796
Did you live near a beach?

25:18.760 --> 25:20.057
Mmm?

25:21.310 --> 25:22.516
No.

25:25.270 --> 25:27.352
You said you were from California.

25:27.440 --> 25:28.555
It's a big state.

25:31.650 --> 25:34.448
I lived close enough.

25:37.110 --> 25:38.270
What was it like?

25:39.740 --> 25:41.480
What does it matter, Charlie?

25:45.330 --> 25:46.490
It doesn't.

26:02.010 --> 26:03.807
You've never been, have you?

26:06.480 --> 26:07.686
To California?

26:08.600 --> 26:09.931
To the beach.

26:18.910 --> 26:23.119
I was supposed to go to Galveston
with my mom and dad.

26:25.080 --> 26:26.650
We had it all planned.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.127
Well, they did.

26:32.840 --> 26:34.910
We were gonna spend the day
on the beach...

26:36.590 --> 26:38.672
Go to the boardwalk at night.

26:40.260 --> 26:43.923
Maybe even go on the roller coaster
at the end of the pier.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.397
But then everything changed.

26:52.770 --> 26:54.021
And...

27:00.700 --> 27:02.520
We all missed out on things, Charlie.

27:10.460 --> 27:12.337
Sometimes when I'm reading,

27:14.500 --> 27:17.958
I just like to close my eyes,

27:20.430 --> 27:22.250
and try to see what I just read about.

27:25.850 --> 27:28.091
But I haven't been able to find
any books about Galveston.

27:38.990 --> 27:40.696
The last time I was at a beach,

27:42.870 --> 27:44.269
it was just like everywhere else.

27:45.530 --> 27:46.940
Filled with the dead.

27:53.040 --> 27:54.996
Just another place that kept you running.

28:08.470 --> 28:09.971
Go get some sleep.

28:45.590 --> 28:46.750
Charlie?

28:53.980 --> 28:55.140
Charlie?

29:11.200 --> 29:12.701
- You can't be in here.
- No.

29:15.120 --> 29:16.280
Get up.

29:16.380 --> 29:17.995
No. No! Someone might come back for them!

29:18.090 --> 29:19.830
- Someone might try to find them.
- Who? Who?

29:19.920 --> 29:21.046
Someone!

29:21.840 --> 29:25.253
Anyone who gave a shit
about these people is dead.

29:25.340 --> 29:26.546
You don't know that!

29:27.550 --> 29:29.882
Look, I'm not trying to
make up for what I did.

29:30.100 --> 29:31.510
Okay? I know that I can't.

29:31.600 --> 29:33.670
I know I'm garbage. But I'm doing this.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.147
Do whatever you want.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.277
It's not gonna make you
feel better about any of it.

30:13.930 --> 30:15.761
The wind's getting stronger.

30:24.530 --> 30:26.987
Charlie. Charlie, look.

30:28.530 --> 30:29.986
I know what you're trying to do.

30:30.910 --> 30:32.537
No one's gone until they're gone.

30:35.120 --> 30:36.747
I've been trying to believe it, too,

30:36.830 --> 30:38.786
to feel better about what I've done,
but I can't.

30:38.870 --> 30:43.125
Because sometimes when you're gone,
you're just gone.

30:44.760 --> 30:49.424
Okay? And these people
are definitely gone.

30:54.270 --> 30:55.885
These pictures aren't gonna change that.

31:02.270 --> 31:03.817
Why do you care?

31:15.490 --> 31:16.696
The basement.

31:32.050 --> 31:33.381
Come on.

32:02.420 --> 32:03.876
We're not getting out, are we?

32:06.590 --> 32:07.955
Not through there.

32:09.050 --> 32:10.506
What do we do?

32:19.060 --> 32:20.049
There.

32:22.440 --> 32:24.260
That's our way out.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.057
Charlie, over here.

33:15.860 --> 33:17.566
We're just gonna have to wait it out.

33:21.290 --> 33:22.609
We'll get out.

33:42.180 --> 33:43.886
I don't want to die!

33:48.940 --> 33:50.430
I know.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.100
I don't want to become one of them.

34:01.040 --> 34:04.191
I saw my parents after they turned.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.536
I didn't think it was real.

34:11.960 --> 34:13.791
And they came back.

34:17.930 --> 34:19.295
Like that.

34:25.100 --> 34:26.385
I'm sorry.

34:29.100 --> 34:32.558
I try to remember
what they looked like before, but...

34:35.360 --> 34:36.645
I can't.

34:37.820 --> 34:39.151
I just can't.

34:42.580 --> 34:44.445
I wish I had a picture of them.

34:52.500 --> 34:54.240
Do you still have the gun?

34:58.840 --> 35:02.799
No. No. I can't. I can't.

35:02.890 --> 35:06.599
No, Alicia. I can't end up
like them! I can't.

35:06.680 --> 35:08.341
I don't want to end up like them!

35:09.140 --> 35:11.188
- I can't.
- Your mom, your brother...

35:11.270 --> 35:13.010
- They're all gone because of me!
- Stop it!

35:13.110 --> 35:15.066
- I took them away from you!
- Stop it! Charlie!

35:15.150 --> 35:17.061
No! I'm not doing it!

35:20.570 --> 35:22.197
We're not gonna make it.

35:23.410 --> 35:25.822
We're gonna make it out.
We're going to make it out.

35:25.910 --> 35:27.446
- We're not. And you know that.
- We are.

35:27.540 --> 35:31.203
We won't! You know _that!
So please just do It!

35:31.960 --> 35:33.370
Just do it!

35:35.300 --> 35:37.006
I know that you want to.

35:37.090 --> 35:40.173
I can't end up like them! I just can't.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.299
I can't!

36:37.770 --> 36:39.067
I can't!

36:39.150 --> 36:41.607
I'm sorry. I can't.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.816
I can't. I can't.

37:02.550 --> 37:03.676
What was that?

37:03.760 --> 37:05.751
Something fell on the door.

37:16.900 --> 37:18.219
Charlie, push!

37:56.310 --> 37:57.800
Alicia, look.

38:00.820 --> 38:02.105
He fell on the door.

38:05.110 --> 38:06.441
He saved us.

39:00.420 --> 39:02.285
Did you do that for me or you?

39:04.460 --> 39:06.758
I did it for the people
who could come back.

39:13.010 --> 39:14.637
I found this in the house.

39:24.730 --> 39:25.890
You keep it.

39:35.620 --> 39:38.362
So, you're good at finding things?

40:17.330 --> 40:18.945
I can see her in you.

40:20.160 --> 40:21.570
Even if you can't.

40:23.250 --> 40:24.569
She's there.

40:36.850 --> 40:38.761
I left Morgan alone in the storm.

40:40.430 --> 40:42.227
I walked away from him.

40:46.060 --> 40:47.891
I walked away from all of them.

40:51.650 --> 40:53.060
I'm good at finding things.

41:09.750 --> 41:10.830
Close your eyes.

41:14.340 --> 41:15.420
Why?

41:18.470 --> 41:19.801
I'm gonna take you to the beach.

41:23.520 --> 41:26.307
I didn't say it before, but it's one of
my favourite places to go.

41:33.530 --> 41:37.022
You're in the car. The windows are down.

41:39.740 --> 41:42.152
You can feel the air. It's soft.

41:44.500 --> 41:45.785
It smells like salt.

41:47.540 --> 41:49.121
That's how you know you're close.

41:51.800 --> 41:53.415
Then you hear the waves.

41:55.590 --> 41:57.137
And you see the beach.

41:59.100 --> 42:01.056
You take off your shoes.

42:01.140 --> 42:02.516
Put your feet on the sand.

42:03.180 --> 42:06.559
You can feel the sand in between your toes
as you walk towards the water.

42:09.400 --> 42:11.777
And when you go in, it's cold at first.

42:13.110 --> 42:14.987
But the longer you stay in,

42:17.910 --> 42:19.775
the more you don't want to get out.

42:23.620 --> 42:25.110
And you float.

42:30.210 --> 42:32.872
And you look back at all
the people on the beach.

42:36.970 --> 42:38.176
Are you there?

42:39.800 --> 42:41.290
I'm in the water.

42:43.100 --> 42:44.556
It's really blue.

42:47.140 --> 42:48.767
I'm looking back to shore and...

42:51.860 --> 42:53.066
And what?

42:59.910 --> 43:01.366
I can see them.

43:03.660 --> 43:05.446
My mom and dad. I can...

43:06.410 --> 43:08.037
I can see them again.

43:33.980 --> 43:35.470
Strand?

43:37.900 --> 43:39.140
Luciana?

43:39.990 --> 43:41.275
Luci?

43:46.240 --> 43:47.320
Strand?

44:01.720 --> 44:03.130
Alicia!

44:19.900 --> 44:21.231
We have to find them.

44:21.860 --> 44:22.986
- Charlie.
- No.

44:23.070 --> 44:25.777
We have to find them and help them.

44:27.540 --> 44:29.246
We don't know if they're alive.

44:35.960 --> 44:37.336
They're gone.

44:42.220 --> 44:43.505
Charlie...

44:47.640 --> 44:49.176
Things don't get better.

44:51.020 --> 44:52.556
And they're not going to.

44:54.810 --> 44:56.186
They're only gonna get worse.

44:58.900 --> 45:01.778
Though we're not around to see
how bad they can get.

45:48.910 --> 45:50.286
Come on.
