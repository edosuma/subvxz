[dramatic music playing]

01:27.240 --> 01:28.520
Hasan, you with us?

01:29.520 --> 01:32.960
Here we go. Elias Mannix, 15 years old.

01:33.040 --> 01:34.880
Hasan, briefing please.

01:34.960 --> 01:37.320
Mannix was placed into the system
when he was four,

01:37.400 --> 01:40.600
and he wound up
in the same care home as Syed Tahir.

01:40.680 --> 01:43.600
Care homeowners say,
wherever Mannix went, Syed followed.

01:43.680 --> 01:45.160
Then three years ago,

01:45.240 --> 01:48.920
Mannix got adopted
by Andrew and Elaine Morley.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.600
-He's an ex-copper. She's a Reiki healer.
-Oh, love Reiki.

01:53.640 --> 01:55.560
This CCTV footage was taken

01:55.640 --> 01:58.200
ten minutes before
the Longharvest Lane body was found.

02:00.160 --> 02:03.600
So you think Mannix is the killer?
And that Syed took the blame?

02:03.680 --> 02:05.640
I had Syed right in front of me.

02:05.720 --> 02:09.120
All he had to do was talk and he couldn't.

02:09.200 --> 02:12.200
Echo Tango 1 to Echo Tango 2,
approaching location.

02:13.160 --> 02:14.040

02:28.480 --> 02:31.640
[officer 2] Armed police, get down!
Get down on your knees!

02:31.720 --> 02:35.400
-Put your hands where I can see them.
-[officer 3] Where's your son Elias?

02:35.480 --> 02:36.560
[officer 4] Check upstairs.

02:36.640 --> 02:39.040
-[officer 5] Stay down!
-[officer 6] Where's Mannix?

02:39.120 --> 02:41.120
-[Andrew] Need some help?
-[officer 6] Armed police!

02:41.200 --> 02:43.800
-Against the wall! Against the wall!
-Okay! Okay!

02:43.880 --> 02:46.760
[officer 5] Show me your hands!
Armed police!

02:47.280 --> 02:48.760
[officer 2] Clear downstairs.

02:58.080 --> 03:00.080
[suspenseful music playing]

03:11.120 --> 03:12.240
[Hasan] What the fuck?

03:19.120 --> 03:19.960
[Barber] Jesus.

03:25.120 --> 03:27.880
So you're saying
you haven't seen Elias in two days?

03:27.960 --> 03:30.160
-That's right.
-And when he last walked out the door,

03:30.240 --> 03:32.120
he didn't say where he was going?

03:32.200 --> 03:33.240
-[Andrew] Mm.
-[Elaine] No.

03:33.320 --> 03:35.920
-[Barber] You didn't ask him?
-[Andrew scoffs] He's 15.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.920
I mean, lads that age,
they're out the door, slam.

03:39.920 --> 03:43.280
Look, what's going on?
We're really starting to worry.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.840
-[intriguing music playing]
-[plastic crinkling]

03:46.720 --> 03:48.960
[Hasan] I just found these
in Elias' bedroom.

03:49.760 --> 03:52.400
That's me picking up my son
from school last Friday.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.840
Can you think
why your son is following me?

03:56.920 --> 03:58.720
-Taking pictures?
-[Elaine] What?

03:58.800 --> 04:00.720
-Putting me on his wall?
-[Elaine] No.

04:04.280 --> 04:05.920
[Hasan] Have you ever seen
this boy before?

04:07.240 --> 04:09.720
-[Elaine] No.
-[Hasan] His name is Syed Tahir.

04:09.800 --> 04:12.520
He was in the same care home as Elias.
They were close.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.240
[Elaine] No.

04:16.160 --> 04:18.520
We've never seen him.
Elias has never mentioned him.

04:18.600 --> 04:21.000
Syed was our main suspect in a murder.

04:21.080 --> 04:23.080
Before he killed himself.

04:26.120 --> 04:28.920
That's Elias with Syed, holding the gun

04:29.000 --> 04:30.800
Syed later used to take his own life.

04:30.880 --> 04:32.560
Yeah. You okay? You all right?

04:32.640 --> 04:34.640
-There's the victim we believe Syed…
-[Elaine gasps]

04:34.720 --> 04:37.000
…may or may not have murdered
with the same gun.

04:38.400 --> 04:39.600
[patting back]

04:39.680 --> 04:41.000
-You all right?
-Mm.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.800
Andrew, you're ex-job, right?

04:42.880 --> 04:44.120
[Andrew] Mm.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.040
Sergeant, 20 years, armed police.

04:46.640 --> 04:50.240
You're the adoptive parent
of a psychologically troubled kid

04:50.320 --> 04:51.920
with a history of misdemeanors.

04:52.440 --> 04:53.440
Didn't it cross your mind

04:53.520 --> 04:56.040
to notify the police he's missing
and you don't know where he was?

04:56.120 --> 04:56.960
[Barber] Hasan!

04:59.080 --> 04:59.920
[Andrew sighs]

05:00.000 --> 05:03.080
If we're knocking on his door every day
and checking his search history,

05:03.160 --> 05:06.440
and asking where he's going,
we're just another institution to him.

05:07.560 --> 05:08.400
I don't know

05:09.520 --> 05:11.320
why he's got you on his wall.

05:11.400 --> 05:12.960
And I don't know what this is,

05:13.040 --> 05:15.440
but don't make your mind up
on him too fast, eh?

05:17.240 --> 05:18.520
He's a good kid.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.840
He'll have nothing to do
with your dead body.

05:22.280 --> 05:25.000
And we'll do everything we can
to help find him.

05:54.200 --> 05:55.520
What a community.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.920
Safety, family, well-being, body and mind.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.440
You got me.

06:03.520 --> 06:04.480
I've got you.

06:05.280 --> 06:06.400
We've got each other.

06:07.600 --> 06:08.720
United Britain.

06:18.120 --> 06:19.200
[grunts softly]

06:20.880 --> 06:21.960

06:23.640 --> 06:24.640
Mm.

06:28.360 --> 06:29.200
Cheer me up.

[male voice] Your neighbor,
Dunnet, Lorna, is at your door.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.960
I slept through the minute's silence.
Can you believe that?

06:58.040 --> 07:01.240
Lorna, listen, it's-- it's been
really intense today.

07:01.320 --> 07:02.680
-Oops!
-[cat meows]

07:03.320 --> 07:06.480
Oh, come on.
You can tell me all about your bad day.

Jesus, Lorn.

08:16.400 --> 08:17.560
But a dead body?

08:21.440 --> 08:24.280
Actually, I think I saved his life.

08:30.320 --> 08:31.160
Well…

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
I'll drink to that.

08:52.520 --> 08:53.880
We were on the Tube.

We just heard this boom,
like the whole world shook.

[intriguing music playing]

09:00.240 --> 09:02.320
Then darkness and screams.

The light, uh, burned my eyes.

I-- I couldn't see for three days.

everything had changed.

What I remember most, though,
was how the country came together.

We were one again.

gathered in front of the London memorial,

remembering the tragic day 30 years ago,

09:30.680 --> 09:32.560
but also celebrating the new beginning…

09:32.640 --> 09:35.240
-[Lorna coughs, sobs softly]
-…and order that we have now.

09:35.320 --> 09:37.800
[man] After the attack,
when we rebuilt our city,

09:39.000 --> 09:40.760
we all shared a dream…

09:40.840 --> 09:43.800
-[Maplewood] Hey. It's okay.
-…of community where no one's left behind.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.360
Citizens of the new Britain,
we've come so far.

09:48.440 --> 09:49.920
[Lorna] Did you lose someone?

09:50.880 --> 09:51.920
[man] It's no dream.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.440
It's our world.

09:54.520 --> 09:57.000
My dad died, in the blast.

09:57.080 --> 09:58.000
[man] We built it.

09:58.080 --> 09:59.840
[tense music playing]

09:59.920 --> 10:01.200
It took our mom too.

10:02.640 --> 10:03.480
Eventually.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.520
-[man] And this is just the beginning.
-It's just me.

looking out for one another.

We're stronger together.

Stronger than ever.

at Memorial Park in London

10:26.320 --> 10:29.040
were honored to be led
by a very special guest,

the founder of The Executive,
our beloved commander in chief.

10:34.680 --> 10:36.560

The Chief Inspector is ready for you.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.160
[indistinct conversations]

11:10.000 --> 11:13.240
And there was no murder weapon
discovered near the body?

11:14.560 --> 11:15.480
Correct, sir.

11:16.400 --> 11:17.400
Well then, Inspector.

11:17.480 --> 11:21.000
Since the Longharvest corpse
has yet to be identified,

11:21.080 --> 11:24.280
do you believe you've exhausted
all further avenues of, um…

11:24.360 --> 11:25.280
[inhales]

11:25.360 --> 11:27.000
…legitimate enquiry?

11:28.200 --> 11:30.360

Yes, sir, I do.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.440
You did the right thing, lad.

There's no need to rock the boat.

[Charlotte] Oh, the success
is going to her head already.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.600
She won't listen to a word I say.

…fuddy-duddy.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.840
She taught you everything you know,
pay her heed.

12:55.920 --> 12:57.360
I will, Pa.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.800
But her fingers are old.

-They click like castanets.
-Oh, you--

[Ladbroke] Burn it, Hillinghead.
No good will come of it.

13:41.840 --> 13:43.840
[Hillinghead] I'll take it
to the highest authority.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.320
[Ladbroke] Then you're dead already.

you were expecting company.

29:46.560 --> 29:48.120
[chuckles]

29:48.200 --> 29:51.360
[Ashe] I was just informing your wife
that I'm here to pick up some evidence

29:51.440 --> 29:52.760
from the Longharvest murder.

29:52.840 --> 29:55.680
She kindly invited me in
whilst you finished your breakfast.

29:58.120 --> 29:59.080
[Charlotte] Alfred?

30:00.160 --> 30:02.120
Charlotte, this man
has no business in this house.

30:02.200 --> 30:03.200
He's a journalist.

How dare you think
that you can just waltz into my house?

30:38.160 --> 30:40.760

30:44.800 --> 30:49.040
You have the only remaining copy
of the photograph of the murder suspect.

30:49.120 --> 30:51.080
Since you intend to do nothing with it…

Without it, he wins.

I just hope for your sake
that your wife doesn't crack first.

32:10.680 --> 32:13.680
You know from Elias' file
it's easy to make assumptions.

32:15.440 --> 32:18.560
I was wondering
why you'd want to adopt a kid like that.

32:20.520 --> 32:22.760
I watched one of his social worker tapes.

32:23.800 --> 32:26.400
He's telling them
about his re-occurring nightmare.

32:28.120 --> 32:30.800
Where he's holding a little boy

32:31.600 --> 32:32.960
that he has to kill.

32:34.320 --> 32:35.800

32:37.760 --> 32:39.640
It's the sort you never forget.

32:40.920 --> 32:45.200
But I saw how those thoughts tortured him.

32:45.280 --> 32:49.640
That he wanted to get dug out
from wherever he was.

32:58.760 --> 33:02.080
There's been a murder. This is serious.

No. You got Elaine on the ropes.

40:11.560 --> 40:14.360
You're a journalist. And a socialist.

So do you seek merely to roast the police
and further your agenda,

for the Longharvest murder?

I need someone I can trust.

45:57.480 --> 45:58.560
A bloodhound.

46:03.320 --> 46:05.720
I'd be honored, sir.

46:11.680 --> 46:14.360
If you find yourself in danger…

46:17.400 --> 46:18.640
act accordingly.

46:22.320 --> 46:24.680
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

46:28.000 --> 46:28.880
Detective.

46:34.560 --> 46:35.520
Know you are loved.

46:43.480 --> 46:45.480
[dramatic music playing]

46:53.240 --> 46:55.600
[sirens wailing]

47:07.120 --> 47:10.320
-Have they found him yet?
-[Hasan] They're just at the campsite.

47:10.400 --> 47:11.720
[shuddering]

47:15.760 --> 47:22.000
[male presenter] …the credit crunch.
89.5 billion pound sterling will--

47:22.080 --> 47:24.240
15th of September 2008,

47:24.920 --> 47:26.280
the credit crunch…

47:26.360 --> 47:30.040
-What is this?
-…89.5 billion pound sterling…

47:30.120 --> 47:31.760
-[eerie sting]
-[inhales]

47:34.280 --> 47:36.640
It's your turn with Elias, now.

47:37.680 --> 47:39.360
Promise me.

47:39.440 --> 47:41.720
You'll let him know he is loved.

47:41.800 --> 47:43.320
Why do you say that?

47:43.400 --> 47:45.480
-[eerie music playing]
-[laughing]

47:49.400 --> 47:51.400
I just can't anymore.

47:52.160 --> 47:53.680
-[man] What's going on?
-What--

47:54.520 --> 47:55.640
Who the fuck are you?

47:55.720 --> 47:59.320
-Eighty-nine point five billion pound…
-I'm the manager.

47:59.400 --> 48:02.280
-15th September 2008.
-[suspenseful music playing]

48:02.360 --> 48:07.760
The credit crunch.
89.5 billion pound sterling…

48:08.920 --> 48:09.840
You know,

48:11.240 --> 48:16.440
even I started to doubt
what we were doing.

48:17.880 --> 48:20.320
I was worried we were going mad.

48:20.400 --> 48:23.760
Until yesterday,
when you walked into our house,

48:23.840 --> 48:26.000
just like they said you would be.

48:26.920 --> 48:27.920
Who?

48:28.000 --> 48:30.800
[exhales] I want to offer you

48:32.040 --> 48:34.840
my heartfelt thanks

48:35.600 --> 48:37.760
for what you are about to do for Elias.

48:38.800 --> 48:44.160
And my deepest condolences
for Jawad's sacrifice.

48:44.720 --> 48:47.120
-How do you know my kid's name?
-Let him know…

48:47.200 --> 48:50.280
-What do you mean, sacrifice?
-…he will be loved.

48:50.360 --> 48:54.080
-How the fuck do you even know his name?
-I can see it in you. I can feel it.

48:54.800 --> 48:58.960
-[music intensifies]
-You're going to be so important to Elias,

48:59.040 --> 49:00.840
and you have no idea, do you?

49:00.920 --> 49:02.680
[Elaine breathes deeply]

49:02.760 --> 49:05.840
They should be there by now,
shouldn't they?

49:05.920 --> 49:08.200
-Has it happened yet?
-Has what happened yet?

49:08.280 --> 49:09.800
Oh!

49:09.880 --> 49:11.640
[sucks air over teeth]

49:11.720 --> 49:13.240
I've said too much, haven't I?

49:13.320 --> 49:15.440
[sucks air over teeth] The-- Shh.

49:15.520 --> 49:17.240
[inhales] I think so.

49:17.320 --> 49:19.640
[sucks air over teeth] I think I have.

49:19.720 --> 49:24.360
[sucks air over teeth] Shh.

49:24.440 --> 49:25.720
[gags]

49:25.800 --> 49:28.360

49:31.240 --> 49:32.200

49:33.320 --> 49:34.240
-[thuds]
-[gasps]

49:34.320 --> 49:35.920
[dramatic music playing]

49:36.000 --> 49:37.600
[alarm blaring]

49:37.680 --> 49:39.000
[Hasan] Help!

49:42.200 --> 49:44.360
Barber. Tell me you've got him.

49:44.440 --> 49:47.800
Elias isn't in the campervan.
Manager says he's never seen him.

49:47.880 --> 49:49.880
It was Elaine who hired the pitch.

49:49.960 --> 49:51.400
Elaine's lost it.

49:52.240 --> 49:55.440
-She just bit her own fucking tongue off.
-She what?

49:55.520 --> 49:59.040
Morley's a cop. He knew we'd work it out.
He wanted us to get there.

49:59.920 --> 50:03.000
-You're not in the campervan, are you?
-No. Rick is.

50:03.080 --> 50:04.320
It's a trap.

50:05.120 --> 50:06.400
Get him out of there!

50:06.480 --> 50:08.480
[suspenseful music playing]

50:08.560 --> 50:12.640
…15th of September 2008,
the credit crunch.

50:13.400 --> 50:17.240
-89.5 billion pound sterling will--
-[phone ringing]

50:17.320 --> 50:20.240
15th of September 2008…

50:20.320 --> 50:23.920
-Rick, get out of the campervan!
-[chuckling] Are you hearing this?

50:24.520 --> 50:26.440
Some spooky old guy on a record.

50:26.520 --> 50:27.600
Now!

50:31.840 --> 50:34.320
-[imperceptible]
-[dramatic synth music playing]

50:45.520 --> 50:47.120
[music fades]

50:50.280 --> 50:52.920
[male voice] You have arrived,
Greenwich Park University.

50:54.360 --> 50:58.320
[female voice over PA] Faculty of Physics,
specializing in quantum building.

50:58.800 --> 51:02.000
Head of Department
Professor Gabriel Defoe.

51:02.080 --> 51:05.640
-Directive Research, Colin Chapsworth.
-[people conversing indistinctly]

51:06.320 --> 51:08.560
-Senior Research fellow…
-[Maplewood] Hi.

51:12.560 --> 51:14.520
[woman] Hope no one's
in any trouble, officer.

51:14.600 --> 51:16.520
I need to speak to your Head of Faculty.

51:17.520 --> 51:19.760
-[woman] Professor McCabe?
-May I help you?

51:21.280 --> 51:22.120
Yeah.

51:22.960 --> 51:24.320
One of your lecturers,

51:24.400 --> 51:28.880
Professor Defoe, was found shot
in Whitechapel the day before last.

51:28.960 --> 51:29.800
My God.

51:31.520 --> 51:32.400
Is he alive?

51:32.480 --> 51:35.280
Professor, if-- if we could go
somewhere quieter to--

51:35.360 --> 51:36.480
Is this a joke?

51:36.560 --> 51:37.920
[Defoe] I wish!

51:38.000 --> 51:40.320
Some idiot pulls out in front of me.

51:40.400 --> 51:41.760
The driver's fine.

51:41.840 --> 51:42.680
[pants]

51:42.760 --> 51:43.800
The bike isn't.

51:44.320 --> 51:46.600
And I end up needing bloody stitches.
How's your morning?

51:46.680 --> 51:48.240
-Hands up! Now!
-[people screaming]

51:48.320 --> 51:52.120
-Whoa! Me? I haven't done anything.
-Shut up! Hands where I can see them.

51:55.920 --> 51:56.800
This you?

51:59.480 --> 52:00.400
Yes.

52:00.480 --> 52:02.480
You got a twin or something?

52:03.200 --> 52:04.360
No.

52:06.560 --> 52:09.680
I'm bringing you in
for questioning about an attempted murder.

52:10.480 --> 52:11.320
Murder?

52:12.440 --> 52:13.480
Whose?

52:13.560 --> 52:14.600
Yours.
