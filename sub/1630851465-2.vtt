"Notorious Queen"...

00:12.722 --> 00:14.555
-What up, though,
My name is La'Britney.

00:14.556 --> 00:16.432
I am a music artist, actress.

00:16.433 --> 00:19.977
-I'm Mehgan James.
I'm an social media influencer.

00:19.978 --> 00:21.353
-My name is Stormey Ramdhan.

00:21.354 --> 00:24.982
I'm most known for being
an ex-fiancee of Suge Knight.

00:24.983 --> 00:26.859
-My name is Tonesa Welch,

00:26.860 --> 00:28.736
a.k.a. First Lady of BMF.

00:28.737 --> 00:30.988
I went to prison in 2008,

00:30.989 --> 00:32.740
and I was charged
with money laundering.

00:32.741 --> 00:35.743
-Before prison, I didn't realize
that was living life selfishly.

00:35.744 --> 00:37.286
-I want to do something
for my mom.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.496
My mom has just been recently
released from prison.

00:39.497 --> 00:42.541
She was accused of hiring
someone to kill her husband.

00:42.542 --> 00:45.461
She's released. We have to
make up for a lot of lost time.

00:45.462 --> 00:47.838
What has she talked about
with you that she may want?

00:47.839 --> 00:49.339
- Some lobster.
- You know she fancy.

00:49.340 --> 00:51.967
[Chuckles] Also,
I got a girls night plan.

00:51.968 --> 00:54.011
I'm trying to just
gather strong women,

00:54.012 --> 00:56.638
just to create
a good support system.

00:56.639 --> 00:57.765
-I met Stormey...

00:57.766 --> 00:59.516
I've known her
about four years now.

00:59.517 --> 01:02.811
I think having Stormey in LA
is gonna be great,

01:02.812 --> 01:04.521
'cause we have
so much in common.

01:04.522 --> 01:07.316
I'm calling you because
I just ran into an old friend.

01:07.317 --> 01:08.984
She having a wine party
at her house,

01:08.985 --> 01:10.944
so I thought,
let me call La'Britney.

01:10.945 --> 01:13.155
I've known La'Britney
a while know.

01:13.156 --> 01:15.783
The last time I seen La'Britney
back in Detroit,

01:15.784 --> 01:18.243
something happened,
and it didn't sit right with me.

01:18.244 --> 01:20.621
I've been wanting to talk to her
about it

01:20.622 --> 01:21.663
ever since it happened.

01:21.664 --> 01:22.748
- Ahh!
- Hello!

01:22.749 --> 01:24.458
-La'Britney introduces Toni

01:24.459 --> 01:26.293
and Stormey as her friends,
and I'm like,

01:26.294 --> 01:28.629
"Sis, are you sure these
aren't your auntie?"

01:28.630 --> 01:30.839
I've never had family support.

01:30.840 --> 01:33.258
They don't understand,
like, my hustle.

01:33.259 --> 01:35.219
Hearing Mehgan's situation,
I couldn't imagine

01:35.220 --> 01:37.137
not feeling supported
or not feeling love.

01:37.138 --> 01:38.764
I think, deep down inside,
she's hurting.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.891
-Are you... Are you, like,
into, like, spirituality and...

01:40.892 --> 01:43.060
- I am. I love crystals.
- Later on in the week,

01:43.061 --> 01:45.354
I'm having a little
spirituality party.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.648
-Like, I need this so they
can tell me all their tea,

01:47.649 --> 01:51.443
because I feel like some people
are hiding a few things,

01:51.444 --> 01:54.696
and I definitely need
to know what's up.

Last week, La'Britney introduced
me to Toni and Stormey.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.037
They're not usually the type

02:44.038 --> 02:45.455
of girls that I would
hang out with.

02:45.456 --> 02:47.374
So, I have to tell
my best friend Demarcus

02:47.375 --> 02:49.960
about this new group of ladies
and see what he thinks.

02:49.961 --> 02:52.045
I had pulled up to this little

02:52.046 --> 02:54.173
video set thing for this girl.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.508
Her name was La'Britney,
and she's a singer.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.552
And then I meet two other women.

02:58.553 --> 03:01.096
One of them wh...
Her name was Stormey.

03:01.097 --> 03:03.473
Stormey about 46.

03:03.474 --> 03:07.102
Supposedly she was married
to Suge Knight.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.729
- Interesting.
- So... So, yeah.

03:08.730 --> 03:12.316
The other lady's name
was Tonesa.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.109
Tonesa about 56.

03:14.110 --> 03:15.694
La'Britney introduced me
to them.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.613
I didn't know
they were gonna be old.

03:17.614 --> 03:18.864
Like...

03:18.865 --> 03:21.325
They're fucking old.

03:21.326 --> 03:24.328
Toni's man is some

03:24.329 --> 03:28.081
big drug dealer cousin...
Sister, brother, baby daddy.

03:28.082 --> 03:29.374
-Oh.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.418
Like, real life drug dealer?
- Like, real life drug dealer.

03:31.419 --> 03:33.629
Toni said she had went to jail.
- Oh.

03:33.630 --> 03:36.131
-Mm-hmm. She said it was like
"Orange Is The New Black."

03:36.132 --> 03:39.009
- So, she's wearing jumpsuits.
- She's wearing jumpsuits.

03:39.010 --> 03:43.055
And then, Stormey, obviously,
Suge Knight is in jail, too.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.933
-So you hanging out with a whole
bunch of convict girlfriends.

03:45.934 --> 03:48.352
- [Laughs] Convict queens, right?
- Yeah, basically.

03:48.353 --> 03:49.978
-Basically, and I'm just like,

03:49.979 --> 03:52.189
I don't even know how I fit
in this real situation

03:52.190 --> 03:53.357
because I never been to jail.

03:53.358 --> 03:54.816
My baby daddy never
been to jail.

03:54.817 --> 03:56.193
I ain't even got no baby daddy.

03:56.194 --> 03:57.819
- You still working on that.
- We working on that.

03:57.820 --> 03:59.321
Maybe I should have
older friends,

03:59.322 --> 04:01.073
because then, like, you know,
like, the guys that

04:01.074 --> 04:02.741
I'm, like, talking to probably
wouldn't want to date them.

04:02.742 --> 04:05.285
So that cancels that out,
and then, like,

04:05.286 --> 04:06.995
there probably
won't be as much drama

04:06.996 --> 04:08.622
because, like,
what they gonna do?

04:08.623 --> 04:10.916
Like, they're not gonna want
to fight me or anything.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.501
So maybe I should stick
to older friends.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.378
Maybe that's why La'Britney
has older friends,

04:14.379 --> 04:16.338
because it's just less drama.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.840
Oh and then,
everybody was talking

04:18.841 --> 04:21.593
about they family this,
they family that.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.720
My mom this, my mom that.
- Oh, Lord.

04:23.721 --> 04:25.389
And I was like, I don't know
what y'all talking about

04:25.390 --> 04:27.266
because I don't rock
with my family like that.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.768
Like, I'm out here solo
motherfuckin' dolo.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.770
I don't care.
- You not really, but okay.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.522
-Okay, then.
Yes, really.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.440
- You have a family.
- I don't have a family.

04:35.441 --> 04:37.025
-You was blessed
with two mothers.

04:37.026 --> 04:38.527
-No, I was blessed
with zero mothers

04:38.528 --> 04:41.488
and one grandmother
that raised me as her own.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.115
-That's 'cause
of those two mothers.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.158
- One mother.
- Okay?

04:45.159 --> 04:47.369
And they were like, oh,
my mom this, my mom that.

04:47.370 --> 04:48.996
I was like, I'm sorry.
I'm not close to my family.

04:48.997 --> 04:51.581
I'm not close to my mom.
I don't talk to her, period.

04:51.582 --> 04:53.375
And it's none of they business,
really.

04:53.376 --> 04:55.252
-Yeah, so it needs to be
discussed with the family.

04:55.253 --> 04:57.254
That's all.
- Nothing needs to be discussed

04:57.255 --> 04:58.630
because I'm at peace, okay?

04:58.631 --> 05:01.675
The ladies that I met are
very, very family orientated.

05:01.676 --> 05:04.052
And, you know, I'm
the black sheep of my family,

05:04.053 --> 05:05.345
and I'm not close to my mother.

05:05.346 --> 05:06.763
So it makes me feel
a bit uncomfortable

05:06.764 --> 05:08.557
when they get to talking
about their family.

05:08.558 --> 05:12.269
We was talking about, you know,
relationships and stuff.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.187
And I told them cheating,
for me,

05:14.188 --> 05:15.689
wasn't a deal breaker.
- Yeah.

05:15.690 --> 05:18.358
And I was like, as long
as my nigga cheat respectfully.

05:18.359 --> 05:19.735
And then La'Britney
was just like,

05:19.736 --> 05:21.695
"Well, I'm not staying
with no cheating man.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.739
I'm gonna leave.
I know my worth."

05:23.740 --> 05:25.615
That's probably why she single.

05:25.616 --> 05:28.952
What else happened? Oh.
Miss Stormey don't even drink.

05:28.953 --> 05:32.414
Like, how you married to
a mob boss music executive,

05:32.415 --> 05:34.041
and you don't drink? Like...

05:34.042 --> 05:36.126
She gave me, like,
goody two shoes vibes.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.377

05:37.378 --> 05:39.212
behind her little
goody two shoes vibe.

05:39.213 --> 05:41.381

05:53.227 --> 05:55.604

08:40.561 --> 08:42.938
night and day.
- Yeah, absolutely.

08:42.939 --> 08:47.526
We would pay $1,200
for a crib at home,

08:47.527 --> 08:49.486
and that same house out here

08:49.487 --> 08:53.114
gonna run you about four bands.
- Right. That's crazy.

08:53.115 --> 08:54.991
That's what's gonna keep
my ass at home, honestly.

08:54.992 --> 08:56.535
-[Laughs] No, no, no, no.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.411
I'm trying
to not think about that

08:58.412 --> 09:00.789
because California is worth it,
bro.

09:00.790 --> 09:03.667
-When I first started
coming out here

09:03.668 --> 09:05.585
when I was younger.

09:05.586 --> 09:07.295
It changed my life,
just me taking

09:07.296 --> 09:09.839
that leap of faith,
coming from home to California.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.841
You seen the opportunities
I've been able to do

09:11.842 --> 09:14.219
that I would've never been
able to do at home.

09:14.220 --> 09:17.430
I've always traveled
from Detroit to LA for work.

09:17.431 --> 09:20.267
I've come here to record music,
shoot videos.

09:20.268 --> 09:23.019
But, like, now I'm ready
to make this transition

09:23.020 --> 09:25.105
from Detroit to California
permanently

09:25.106 --> 09:27.607
because there's a lot
of opportunity here

09:27.608 --> 09:30.068
for not only myself,
but also my children.

09:30.069 --> 09:34.739
And I'm ready to really take
my career to the next level.

09:34.740 --> 09:37.993
So if I put this music out
and it fails,

09:37.994 --> 09:39.869
I'm doing all this for nothing.

09:39.870 --> 09:41.079
-So you met the girls?

09:41.080 --> 09:42.581
- Yeah.
- What's that like? They cool?

09:42.582 --> 09:44.583
-Yeah, I met... Well, you know,

09:44.584 --> 09:46.334
I-I've known Toni for a while.

09:46.335 --> 09:48.336
Ashley,
she introduced me to Mehgan

09:48.337 --> 09:50.463
the other day at the shoot.
- Okay. How was that...

09:50.464 --> 09:52.632
And then I met Stormey
for the first time,

09:52.633 --> 09:54.175
and we all linked up yesterday.

09:54.176 --> 09:56.303
It was cool.
It was a really dope vibes.

09:56.304 --> 09:57.637
Everybody told they stories,

09:57.638 --> 10:01.016
but I was really inspired
by Toni's story.

10:01.017 --> 10:05.729
I've known Toni for at least
like five years now.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.981
We actually met
at home in Detroit,

10:07.982 --> 10:09.858
and I've been rocking with Toni
ever since.

10:09.859 --> 10:12.527
She talked about
how she went to prison.

10:12.528 --> 10:13.778
You know, when BMF,

10:13.779 --> 10:15.739
when that whole operation
got set down,

10:15.740 --> 10:17.365
she did, too, her whole family.

10:17.366 --> 10:18.992
So I talked to her
and asked her...

10:18.993 --> 10:21.202
You know, like,
I know that was hard,

10:21.203 --> 10:22.662
being away from her children.

10:22.663 --> 10:24.914
What I admire most about Toni
is her strength.

10:24.915 --> 10:26.833
She's been through a lot
of things in her past,

10:26.834 --> 10:29.586
you know, her going to prison,
being away from her family.

10:29.587 --> 10:33.840
I know that she has dealt with
and endured a lot of things,

10:33.841 --> 10:36.092
and to see her still
wake up every day

10:36.093 --> 10:38.803
with a smile on her face,
I really admire that.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.680
I admire her strength
as a woman.

10:40.681 --> 10:42.223
So I'm looking forward
to becoming

10:42.224 --> 10:43.642
better friends with her.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.602
Strong women, but Mehgan,

10:45.603 --> 10:47.646
she seem like Hollywood girl,
you know.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.564
Like... Like, she was
talking about,

10:49.565 --> 10:51.399
she don't care if her man cheat.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.859
- What?!
- Mm-hmm.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.819
-I believe in cheating
respectfully.

10:54.820 --> 10:57.280
I'm like... not me.

10:57.281 --> 10:59.574
Can't let my nigga think
that I'm okay with that.

10:59.575 --> 11:00.825
- Nah. Yeah.
- Not me.

11:00.826 --> 11:02.077
That's a no, no.
- I said,

11:02.078 --> 11:03.995
I'm the catch in this bitch.
- Absolutely.

11:03.996 --> 11:05.747
You cannot let a man think

11:05.748 --> 11:07.582
you're okay with him cheating.
- No.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.125
-I understand there
ain't nobody perfect.

11:09.126 --> 11:11.378
And shit gonna happen
in a relationship.

11:11.379 --> 11:14.297
But I'll never be okay saying,
like, "Oh, I mean,

11:14.298 --> 11:15.674
I know my man's gonna cheat.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.467
Like, if he cheats,
that's okay."

11:17.468 --> 11:19.469
Hell nah. Fuck that.

11:19.470 --> 11:21.388
- [Sighs]
- Right. Just woosa.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.598
- I know.
- Take a couple deep breaths.

11:23.599 --> 11:25.392
Don't be stressing yourself out.

11:25.393 --> 11:27.769
- I need to go to the dispensary.
- That too.

11:27.770 --> 11:30.271

11:46.247 --> 11:48.665
- Let me come over there.
- Yeah, you're a little too far.

11:48.666 --> 11:51.292
And, you know, we've been
too far for too long.

11:51.293 --> 11:53.169
-For 24 years story, Stormey.

11:53.170 --> 11:55.171
-That's enough.
[Both laugh]

11:55.172 --> 11:56.756
The coaster right here for you.
- Okay.

11:56.757 --> 11:59.509
-How, you know...
How's it feel to be back home?

11:59.510 --> 12:01.594
-Oh, I just feel so good.

12:01.595 --> 12:03.263
It was really hard for me.

12:03.264 --> 12:05.890
Every day was a lonely day.

12:05.891 --> 12:08.143
-It's only been a few days
since my mom's been home,

12:08.144 --> 12:10.937
but my mom had been
sent to prison

12:10.938 --> 12:12.731
when I was in my early 20s.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.482
She was arrested at my house.

12:14.483 --> 12:16.693
The police was outside
of my house for a few days,

12:16.694 --> 12:19.028
and they came in,
and my mom was so gracious.

12:19.029 --> 12:20.697
She just told them,
she says, you know,

12:20.698 --> 12:22.115
"This is my daughter's home,

12:22.116 --> 12:25.702
but when you walk me out,
can you cover my handcuffs?

12:25.703 --> 12:27.454
Because I don't want
my daughter's neighbors

12:27.455 --> 12:28.830
to see this."

12:28.831 --> 12:31.291
And I'm just really lucky
to have a mother like that.

12:31.292 --> 12:33.710
Oh, Stormey,
after seeing everybody...

12:33.711 --> 12:37.005
Seeing my five children,
my five heartbeats.

12:37.006 --> 12:39.299
Oh, Stormey, it's wonderful.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.635
Before I got arrested,
I only had one grandchild.

12:42.636 --> 12:44.095
Now I have eight.
- I know.

12:44.096 --> 12:46.014
- Eight grandchildren.
- See how your family has grown.

12:46.015 --> 12:49.142
So, now that's something that
we got in common again now.

12:49.143 --> 12:50.143
I'm a granny.

12:50.144 --> 12:53.772
After doing 24 years
in state prison,

12:53.773 --> 12:55.148
she definitely needs me here.

12:55.149 --> 12:56.232
We're very close,

12:56.233 --> 12:58.943
and with all
what we have been through,

12:58.944 --> 13:00.361
we know how to stick together,

13:00.362 --> 13:02.614
and we're gonna go...
Go through the ups and downs,

13:02.615 --> 13:04.824
but we know how
to get through it.

13:04.825 --> 13:09.329
-There wasn't a day that went by
that I didn't miss you all,

13:09.330 --> 13:10.789
struggled to get out of there.

13:10.790 --> 13:14.667
I appreciate everybody was there
at the gate When I get out.

13:14.668 --> 13:16.294
-I'm glad that
the prison officials

13:16.295 --> 13:17.837
allowed us to be out there,
because they said

13:17.838 --> 13:19.589
that was the first time
that they allowed...

13:19.590 --> 13:21.007
- They allowed that.
- so many people

13:21.008 --> 13:22.550
to be out there, you know?

13:22.551 --> 13:25.553
You seen... When we seen you
hit that gate, we was all, aah!

13:25.554 --> 13:26.679
[Laughs]

13:26.680 --> 13:28.640
-All that love...
It just meant so much for us.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.183
-It was important
for us to be there.

13:30.184 --> 13:32.685
We wanted you to know
that you was supported,

13:32.686 --> 13:35.271
loved, and missed every day.

13:35.272 --> 13:39.734
Not having my mother
for 24 years, um...

13:39.735 --> 13:43.238
it's very... it was
very devastating experience.

13:43.239 --> 13:46.574
Every day she complained of,
she just wanted to come home,

13:46.575 --> 13:47.951
and that's really
heart wrenching,

13:47.952 --> 13:49.911
and it tears on your soul
and your spirit

13:49.912 --> 13:52.705
when you know that you would
do anything for somebody,

13:52.706 --> 13:55.041
especially your mother,
and you can't.

13:55.042 --> 13:57.919
She left behind all
of her children.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.046
I felt very, very alone.

14:00.047 --> 14:02.006
I never want to think
about jail for her again.

14:02.007 --> 14:04.509
Well, we got you now,
got you back home.

14:04.510 --> 14:07.303
-Now I just have to learn
to use those phones

14:07.304 --> 14:08.471
that you can see through.

14:08.472 --> 14:10.890
I can actually see you all
on the phone.

14:10.891 --> 14:12.976
-So... So you come home,
and it's like the Jetsons,

14:12.977 --> 14:14.644
right?
- Yeah.

14:14.645 --> 14:17.272
And what's the lady's name
in the phone?

14:17.273 --> 14:18.398
Sierra?

14:18.399 --> 14:20.316
-No, her name is Siri.

14:20.317 --> 14:21.568
- Siri.
- [Laughs]

14:21.569 --> 14:23.903
- And what's the other one?
- Which one?

14:23.904 --> 14:25.405
- Erica.
- Oh, no.

14:25.406 --> 14:27.740
It's not Erica, Mommy.
It's Alexis.

14:27.741 --> 14:28.950
-Oh...
-Alexa!

14:28.951 --> 14:31.035
You got me mixing it up now.

14:31.036 --> 14:33.830
[Laughs]

14:33.831 --> 14:35.915
Now, see, when I went in,

14:35.916 --> 14:37.917
they had beepers.

14:37.918 --> 14:39.752
-[Chuckles] We did have beepers.

14:39.753 --> 14:41.504
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

14:41.505 --> 14:44.632
-I'm 69 years old.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.593
What about my 40s?

14:46.594 --> 14:48.177
- That's right.
- Where did they go?

14:48.178 --> 14:50.221
-'Cause you went in at 42.

14:50.222 --> 14:53.558
That's the same age I am now.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.143
I couldn't imagine my life

14:55.144 --> 14:58.396
being taken right now from me.

14:58.397 --> 14:59.856
- Yeah.
- You know that?

14:59.857 --> 15:02.692
♪♪

15:02.693 --> 15:04.068
- Yeah.
- I thought about that,

15:04.069 --> 15:06.112
and you missed out on so much,
you know,

15:06.113 --> 15:09.824
'cause I still see so much
future ahead of me, you know,

15:09.825 --> 15:11.743
and... and...
And I would just...

15:11.744 --> 15:15.997
I-I-I don't know how I could,
you know, deal with that,

15:15.998 --> 15:18.583
knowing that my life
would be taken from me...

15:18.584 --> 15:21.377
Or... Or yours was
taken from you

15:21.378 --> 15:23.755
at this point at where
I'm at in my life.

15:23.756 --> 15:27.091
20 years ago, I didn't realize
it because I was so young.

15:27.092 --> 15:31.012
But now, since I've lived life
and I'm still living life,

15:31.013 --> 15:34.223
I couldn't imagine it being
taken away from me right now.

15:34.224 --> 15:36.517
I couldn't imagine being
away from my family,

15:36.518 --> 15:38.686
not being able
to see my kids grow

15:38.687 --> 15:40.688
and don't even want to think
about it.

15:40.689 --> 15:44.609
-Every time they diagnosed me
with another cancer, I fought.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.820
I asked God,
"Don't let me die in prison."

15:47.821 --> 15:48.905
-I promised to God,

15:48.906 --> 15:50.740
you a walking miracle.
- Yeah.

15:50.741 --> 15:53.743
Breast cancer,
ovarian cancer, brain cancer,

15:53.744 --> 15:56.913
you know, liver cancer,
still standing,

15:56.914 --> 15:58.122
-Still standing.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.083
I'm so inspired by my mom.

16:00.084 --> 16:01.960
I think she's one
of the most courageous

16:01.961 --> 16:04.587
and strongest women
that I would ever know.

16:04.588 --> 16:08.216
Her fighting her cancer
definitely keeps me motivated.

16:08.217 --> 16:11.511
The days that I want to feel bad
and feel sorry for myself,

16:11.512 --> 16:13.137
I have it in me to keep fighting

16:13.138 --> 16:14.764
and just know that I can always,

16:14.765 --> 16:17.016
you know, pull myself together
and push through.

16:17.017 --> 16:19.644
You beat it. You beat it down.
You stomped it.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.062
And you're gonna
continue to do it.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.480
- Yes.
- So we got so much more

16:22.481 --> 16:24.482
to make up for
during all that time.

16:24.483 --> 16:26.067
- Yeah.
- Whatever you want,

16:26.068 --> 16:29.028
we're gonna do it.
- I'm want to go to, um...

16:29.029 --> 16:30.989
back to Laurie's,
like we used to do.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.198
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, I want to go

16:32.199 --> 16:33.992
to those restaurants,
eat lobster,

16:33.993 --> 16:35.410
like we used to do, Stormey.

16:35.411 --> 16:38.329
-You and this lobster, girl.
You've been so expensive,

16:38.330 --> 16:39.497
-Yeah!
[Both laugh]

16:39.498 --> 16:41.040
-Don't get her
no turkey burgers.

16:41.041 --> 16:42.458
Lobster!

16:42.459 --> 16:43.793
You missed out on a lot.

16:43.794 --> 16:46.671
-I did miss out. Yeah.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.423
- We all missed out.
- We all missed out.

16:48.424 --> 16:52.135

watching her raise two kids

32:23.775 --> 32:27.235

I was different.

32:27.236 --> 32:29.571
The least my mom could've done
is been there.

32:29.572 --> 32:30.989
Like, it's okay, like,
if you didn't have

32:30.990 --> 32:33.659
enough money to raise me
or it was a bad time,

32:33.660 --> 32:35.369
but you could have, like,
popped in and out

32:35.370 --> 32:37.329
while living with
my grandparents

32:37.330 --> 32:39.081
to, like, at least
to be in my life.

But I continuously try

32:41.334 --> 32:43.377
to forgive and forgive
and forgive,

32:43.378 --> 32:45.170
and every year,
it's something different.

32:45.171 --> 32:46.588
So, at this point in my life,

32:46.589 --> 32:48.674
like, I'm at peace with
never talking to her again.

it kind of motivates me

she actually may
be dealing with.

33:11.698 --> 33:14.449
I do feel that people,
you know, say things

33:14.450 --> 33:15.659
because they do want help

33:15.660 --> 33:18.036
and they do want someone
to lean on

33:18.037 --> 33:19.454
and to give them their support,

33:19.455 --> 33:21.832
to let them know that it's okay
to feel these things

33:21.833 --> 33:23.750
about how somebody
had made you feel.

33:23.751 --> 33:27.254
But it's also important
to fix those relationships

33:27.255 --> 33:28.588
and to reconcile
with your family,

33:28.589 --> 33:30.382
because at the end of the day,
your family

33:30.383 --> 33:32.050
is sometimes all you have.

33:32.051 --> 33:33.385
Well, I don't know if you know.

33:33.386 --> 33:36.471
My mom has been...
My mom actually went to jail

33:36.472 --> 33:39.224
from my house 24 years ago.

33:39.225 --> 33:41.101
And so I just understand
when it's hard

33:41.102 --> 33:43.311
to not have someone
to feel supporting.

33:43.312 --> 33:45.731
And I didn't feel supported
because my mom wasn't there.

33:45.732 --> 33:47.399
My father's in
a different country

33:47.400 --> 33:49.568
and then my kid's dad
went to jail.

33:49.569 --> 33:51.528
- So, you was on my own.
- So, I was on my own.

33:51.529 --> 33:53.905
Yeah, and when...
When I was on my own, girl,

33:53.906 --> 33:55.824
I mean, all the mess
was coming at me.

33:55.825 --> 33:58.493
I was getting talked about
in the streets totally bad.

33:58.494 --> 34:02.330
It was a mess, and I built
this wall up around myself.

34:02.331 --> 34:05.250
So sometimes, I come off
a little bit defensive

34:05.251 --> 34:07.002
and not very friendly,

34:07.003 --> 34:08.462
and that's because
I'm protecting myself.

34:08.463 --> 34:10.797
I'm so guarded,
and when I do find good people,

34:10.798 --> 34:13.633
I really grasp on to them,
and I open up to them.

34:13.634 --> 34:15.469
And I... I want to trust people

34:15.470 --> 34:18.638
and I really want to overcome
this little niche that I'm in

34:18.639 --> 34:21.683
that does not allow me
to make connections with people.

34:21.684 --> 34:23.727
-Right.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.312
-And I... I know
I struggle with that.

34:25.313 --> 34:26.730
- Mm-hmm.
- And, um...

34:26.731 --> 34:28.148
And that could be from the fact

34:28.149 --> 34:29.691
that I felt like everyone
that I loved

34:29.692 --> 34:33.028
and I care most to my heart
was taken away from me.

34:33.029 --> 34:34.780
-Right.
Yeah.

34:34.781 --> 34:37.491
It means a lot to me
that Stormey's opening up

34:37.492 --> 34:38.909
to me about her own mom,

34:38.910 --> 34:41.703
and I'm starting to see the type
of person that she really is.

34:41.704 --> 34:43.121
My initial impressions
of Stormey

34:43.122 --> 34:44.164
are kind of starting to change.

34:44.165 --> 34:45.457
Maybe she's one of those ladies

34:45.458 --> 34:47.042
that have been through a lot,

34:47.043 --> 34:49.252
and now she's, like, nicer.

34:49.253 --> 34:51.630
Like, it's probably shaped her
into being a better person.

34:51.631 --> 34:54.132

but, like, still yet

34:54.133 --> 34:55.093

34:56.095 --> 34:57.844

35:00.431 --> 35:02.057
about like everything
and everyone.

35:02.058 --> 35:04.017
-Yeah, everyone's...
Everyone's really great.

35:04.018 --> 35:06.269
La'Britney, she's... she's
just such a sweetheart.

35:06.270 --> 35:08.647
She has such a pretty face
to me. [Laughs]

35:08.648 --> 35:12.484
And with Tonesa,
I'm still, you know...

35:12.485 --> 35:15.695
We have this relationship
where we hung out once

35:15.696 --> 35:19.616
and then, you know,
there was a social media post,

35:19.617 --> 35:22.327
and, you know, and that...
And this is when I was

35:22.328 --> 35:25.455
perhaps maybe assuming
or overthinking things,

35:25.456 --> 35:27.249
and I just felt like
a post or comment

35:27.250 --> 35:28.625
was kind of subbing me.

35:28.626 --> 35:31.253
And so I just kind of backed off
from her.

35:31.254 --> 35:33.171
Toni and I had just formed
a new friendship,

35:33.172 --> 35:35.632
and we had just started
hanging out and going out.

35:35.633 --> 35:38.009
And at this particular time,
we had went out to a club.

35:38.010 --> 35:40.220
I want to say the next two days
after or something,

35:40.221 --> 35:44.015
there was a post that she made
and the caption had read

35:44.016 --> 35:45.892
something about
riding her coattails.

35:45.893 --> 35:48.603
And I'm like, well,
the new friend.

35:48.604 --> 35:49.980
Is she talking to me?

35:49.981 --> 35:53.775
So I do think that she...
She made that post towards me.

35:53.776 --> 35:56.486
And I don't know what she may
have been feeling at a time

35:56.487 --> 35:58.613
because it was such
a new friendship.

35:58.614 --> 36:01.074
I'm... I'm still open
to relationships, you know?

36:01.075 --> 36:02.617
And I can admit when I'm wrong,

36:02.618 --> 36:04.202
and I can admit when
I assume something

36:04.203 --> 36:07.080
that probably was incorrect,
so now we're just getting warmed

36:07.081 --> 36:08.206
back up to each other here.
- Rebuilding.

36:08.207 --> 36:09.457
-Yeah. So we're just rebuilding.

36:09.458 --> 36:11.126
-Um, have you guys had
that conversation

36:11.127 --> 36:12.335
We haven't. Yeah.
- Mm.

36:12.336 --> 36:13.837
We haven't.
- Okay.

36:13.838 --> 36:16.131
So I may not have gotten any tea

36:16.132 --> 36:18.675
from Corey's whack ass reading,

36:18.676 --> 36:21.261
but Stormey just poured
some tea, and it's hot.

36:21.262 --> 36:26.433
If Stormey's having some issues
with her "friend"

36:26.434 --> 36:29.019
why is she telling me about it
instead of telling Toni.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.187
That's kind of messy.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.731
Can't wait to see
how this turns out.

36:32.732 --> 36:34.482
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

36:46.954 --> 36:48.914
-What up?
What's the deal?

36:48.915 --> 36:51.583
You look good.
- Thank you. So do you.

36:51.584 --> 36:53.126
- Thank you.
- As usual.

36:53.127 --> 36:54.961
-I ordered for you.

36:54.962 --> 36:56.421
- Chai latte.
- Yes.

36:56.422 --> 36:58.131
- Period.
- Period, right.

36:58.132 --> 37:01.259
-Toni and I run in the same
circles back at home in Detroit.

37:01.260 --> 37:03.803
So we'll see each other
at parties, link up,

37:03.804 --> 37:05.430
and always have a good time.

37:05.431 --> 37:08.141
Before wine night,
the last time I seen Toni

37:08.142 --> 37:09.559
was back home in Detroit.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.770
So I'm excited that
we're both here in LA

37:11.771 --> 37:13.188
and we're able to catch up

37:13.189 --> 37:15.398
and, you know, continue
to build onto our friendship.

37:15.399 --> 37:17.817
- What's going on, girl?
- Oh, man.

37:17.818 --> 37:20.153
Just out here,
running these LA streets.

37:20.154 --> 37:21.947
-Right. Right.

37:21.948 --> 37:23.240
I've been wanting to speak

37:23.241 --> 37:25.742
to La'Britney alone
for a while now.

37:25.743 --> 37:28.286
There's something that
she did back in Detroit

37:28.287 --> 37:30.205
that hadn't sat well with me.

37:30.206 --> 37:31.790
And I'm hoping
when I bring it up,

37:31.791 --> 37:33.541
she can explain herself to me.

37:33.542 --> 37:36.086
If she can't,
we may have a problem...

37:36.087 --> 37:37.212
A big problem.

37:37.213 --> 37:38.672
Still looking for a crib.

37:38.673 --> 37:40.465
Be so happy when
I finally find a place

37:40.466 --> 37:42.050
so I can bring my boys out here,

37:42.051 --> 37:43.885
and it can really feel
like home, you know?

37:43.886 --> 37:46.054
-Like, when mine came out here,
they was like,

37:46.055 --> 37:47.138
"Oh, we don't want to go back."

37:47.139 --> 37:48.515
- See.
- It was over with.

37:48.516 --> 37:49.724
-And then I thought that

37:49.725 --> 37:51.977
I would never
go back to Detroit.

37:51.978 --> 37:52.937
Last year,

37:52.938 --> 37:54.854
I had an extended stay.
- Yeah.

37:54.855 --> 37:58.525
- You know, from my mom passing.
- Sorry to hear that.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.777
-And then the whole
COVID situation.

38:00.778 --> 38:03.989
Then T came home.
It just got kind of caught up.

38:03.990 --> 38:06.574
I was like, oh, I could do this.
I can move back.

38:06.575 --> 38:10.245
And then I thought that this...
This is where I belong.

38:10.246 --> 38:11.538
- Yeah.
- So...

38:11.539 --> 38:12.747
I went home...

38:12.748 --> 38:14.582
I was here in March

38:14.583 --> 38:16.501
right before
they shut down everything.

38:16.502 --> 38:19.296
I was literally here, getting
ready to shoot music videos.

38:19.297 --> 38:22.173
But then everything shut down,
so I went back to Detroit, too.

38:22.174 --> 38:24.384
That was like five, six,
seven months almost.

38:24.385 --> 38:27.470
-Because when I seen you...
[Tense music plays]

38:27.471 --> 38:28.555
I pulled up

38:28.556 --> 38:30.640
to pick up my man...
- Uh-huh.

38:30.641 --> 38:34.144
and your whole titties
was hanging out.

38:34.145 --> 38:36.354
- Oh, they weren't hanging out.
- Not hanging out.

38:36.355 --> 38:37.647
- I can see 'em.
- Yeah.

38:37.648 --> 38:39.941
I had just left a photo shoot,
and I had...

38:39.942 --> 38:40.942
It was a white T-shirt

38:40.943 --> 38:42.485
with no bra vibe.
- Right.

38:42.486 --> 38:45.280
-Toni's got to be kidding me
right now.

38:45.281 --> 38:49.451
The fact that she thinks
I'm trying to flirt with her man

38:49.452 --> 38:51.036
because of what I woke up

38:51.037 --> 38:53.413
and decided to put on
in the morning...

38:53.414 --> 38:54.539
Girl, come on now.

38:54.540 --> 38:57.125
It wasn't to be showy
or, you know,

38:57.126 --> 38:58.918
to be promiscuous or anything.

38:58.919 --> 39:01.046
-I can see your nipples
from the car.

39:01.047 --> 39:01.964
This is my man.

39:01.965 --> 39:03.506
Why are you talking to my man

39:03.507 --> 39:04.716
with a sheer top on.

39:04.717 --> 39:06.051
-But, you know, as a woman,

39:06.052 --> 39:08.345
I'm pulling up
on an attractive girl.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.555
You know, like you said,
they was out,

39:10.556 --> 39:11.890
and I know you.
- Yeah.

39:11.891 --> 39:14.100
-And so I'm like, well,
she know that's my nigga.

39:14.101 --> 39:16.311
-Oh, no, but it was never
about your nigga.

39:16.312 --> 39:17.520
You know what I'm saying?

39:17.521 --> 39:19.147
-No, this...
You not gonna be doing this.

39:19.148 --> 39:20.440
This is not what you gonna do.

39:20.441 --> 39:22.400
This is totally disrespectful.

39:22.401 --> 39:24.152
Totally disrespectful.

39:24.153 --> 39:25.195
This is my girl.

39:25.196 --> 39:28.239
This is somebody
that I want to mentor,

39:28.240 --> 39:29.699
that she can come under me,

39:29.700 --> 39:31.451
'cause I didn't even know
you were there.

39:31.452 --> 39:33.703
- Yeah.
- I'm thinking you still here.

39:33.704 --> 39:36.581
-I have no idea why Toni wants
to bring this up.

39:36.582 --> 39:40.085
At the time, she did rudely
tell me how she felt

39:40.086 --> 39:42.587
about what I was wearing,
but you know what?

39:42.588 --> 39:44.839
I just ignored it 'cause
I ain't want to get into it.

39:44.840 --> 39:47.675
You feel me, but now she want
to bring it up again.

39:47.676 --> 39:50.804
Look, I don't got time
for this at all.

39:50.805 --> 39:51.846
-It took me to a whole

39:51.847 --> 39:53.098
nother level.
- Yeah, right.

39:53.099 --> 39:55.100
So when I said
what I said to you,

39:55.101 --> 39:56.935
it might have came off rough.

39:56.936 --> 39:58.686
What I said to La'Britney is,

39:58.687 --> 40:01.272
"I know,"
pointing at her titties,

40:01.273 --> 40:03.233
"that you are not up here

40:03.234 --> 40:05.693
with your titties out
in front of my man."

40:05.694 --> 40:08.655
It caught me off guard that
I even said it like that

40:08.656 --> 40:10.281
because I said it aggressively,

40:10.282 --> 40:13.993
and her son was there,
but I was so angry at the time.

40:13.994 --> 40:15.120
Really angry.

40:15.121 --> 40:16.871
-I mean,
at the end of the day, like,

40:16.872 --> 40:18.331
I don't know what your...

40:18.332 --> 40:20.166
relationship is like with him,
you know,

40:20.167 --> 40:23.169
and when I get dressed,
I get fresh as hell,

40:23.170 --> 40:25.088
and I'm not thinking
about nobody else.

40:25.089 --> 40:26.923
And they feelings
and how they gonna perceive.

40:26.924 --> 40:29.968
You know what I'm saying?
'Cause I know who I am,

40:29.969 --> 40:31.845
and I know what
my intentions are.

40:31.846 --> 40:33.054
- Right.
- But with you,

40:33.055 --> 40:35.974
I did feel like,
I hope me and her can

40:35.975 --> 40:37.934
have a conversation about this.
- Right.

40:37.935 --> 40:39.686
'Cause I look up
to you as a woman.

40:39.687 --> 40:42.605
Like, I would never want you
to feel disrespected.

40:42.606 --> 40:46.276
-I'm a person that has to say
what's on they mind.

40:46.277 --> 40:49.237
So if we're both
gonna be here in LA,

40:49.238 --> 40:51.406
I want to clear the air
with La'Britney.

40:51.407 --> 40:53.783
Now I'm good,
and I hope she's good,

40:53.784 --> 40:55.160
and there's no hard feelings
from it.

40:55.161 --> 40:57.787
So I'm glad we got to talk,
just me and you.

40:57.788 --> 41:00.957
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Not in front of nobody else.

41:00.958 --> 41:03.918
-This definitely made me feel
some type of way about Toni,

41:03.919 --> 41:07.088
'cause out of nowhere, she just
came at me the wrong way,

41:07.089 --> 41:08.423
and I ain't like that.

41:08.424 --> 41:11.384
I let it slide, get away
with it this one time,

41:11.385 --> 41:13.553
but twice, nah, sis.

41:13.554 --> 41:15.346
We're not gonna
play those games.
