Phew!

01:53.405 --> 01:55.695
[Robin] Where are we?
[Madalyn] I don't know.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.703
[Garth grunts]

01:57.785 --> 01:58.785
[Robin] Grandma?

01:59.787 --> 02:02.827
[Madalyn] It's all right, Red.
We're gonna get out of this.

02:02.915 --> 02:05.285
- Garth?
- [Garth] Yes, Mother.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.495
Did you get a good look at anybody?
Recognize anyone?

02:07.585 --> 02:09.835
- [Garth] No, Mother.
- [Madalyn sighs]

02:09.922 --> 02:11.802
[Robin] Shh.
I think someone's coming.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.804
Check their restraints.

02:15.886 --> 02:17.822
[Madalyn] You wanna tell us
what the hell we're doin' here?

02:17.846 --> 02:18.846
[man] Shut up.

02:18.931 --> 02:20.158
[Madalyn] You're tellin' me to shut up?

02:20.182 --> 02:23.062
I don't think you know whose weeds
you're pissing in, buddy.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.537
- I said shut up.
- [Madalyn] I heard you.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.561
I chose to ignore you.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.397
Who are you working for, huh?

02:28.481 --> 02:32.491
Did Jerry Falwell put you up to this, huh?
The Baptists, that it?

02:32.569 --> 02:34.588
- [Garth whispers] Mother, please.
- I think we're good.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.202
All right, let's go.

02:36.281 --> 02:39.241
[Madalyn] Cocksuckers,
you're not gonna get away with this!

02:41.787 --> 02:44.077
[shouting] Don't you know who I am?

02:49.627 --> 02:51.497
[softly] God damn it.

02:51.588 --> 02:54.218
- [dogs barking]
- [indistinct radio chatter]

02:57.219 --> 02:59.389
So, Mr. Collier,
you say the cars are gone now.

02:59.471 --> 03:00.573
Shouldn't they just be in them?

03:00.597 --> 03:03.177
[Roy] The door was open,
breakfast on the table,

03:03.266 --> 03:05.586
- and they'd never leave without the dogs.
- [man] Mmm-hmm.

03:06.770 --> 03:09.940
And you say that this lady lives here
with her son and his daughter?

03:10.023 --> 03:13.653
Yes. Uh, no.
The granddaughter's from her other son.

03:14.820 --> 03:16.820
It's an interesting living arrangement.

03:18.323 --> 03:19.533
Wait a minute.

03:19.616 --> 03:22.156
Madalyn Murray O'Hair.
That's who we're talking about here?

03:24.121 --> 03:27.371
Are you sure that this isn't just another
one of her publicity stunts?

03:28.583 --> 03:31.173
Aren't you even gonna take
any fingerprints, sir?

03:33.171 --> 03:36.011
[smacks lips] Mr. Collier, this is Texas.

03:37.175 --> 03:39.255
Not against the law to go missing here.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.532
[Madalyn] Garth, I loosened it.
I loosened it.

03:43.556 --> 03:45.451
Come here. Give me your hands.
Give me your hands.

03:45.475 --> 03:46.870
- [Garth] What are you...
- Give me your hands.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.524
Just get it untied. That's...

03:48.603 --> 03:50.164
[Garth] I... I can't.
[Madalyn] You can do it.

03:50.188 --> 03:52.375
- [Garth] Oh, my God. It's really...
- That's it. That's it.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.710
[Garth] What kind of knot is that?

03:53.734 --> 03:55.404
[Madalyn] Come on.
You can do it.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.315
[Garth] Well, get closer to me, then.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.084
- [Madalyn] Oh, all right.
- [Garth grunts]

03:59.114 --> 04:00.454
[Garth] Jesus!
[Madalyn] Come on.

04:00.532 --> 04:01.952
[Garth] Oh. Almost.
I almost got...

04:02.034 --> 04:04.294
[Madalyn] Come on.
[Garth pants] No, I... No, it's not...

04:04.369 --> 04:06.806
- It's useless. It's not gonna happen.
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

04:06.830 --> 04:09.460
I knew I should have sent you
to fucking Boy Scouts.

04:09.541 --> 04:11.310
[Garth] I don't know what you think
you're gonna do anyway.

04:11.334 --> 04:12.344
They both have guns.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.629
[Madalyn sighs]
If we could get these hoods off,

04:14.712 --> 04:17.382
we might have a better idea
of what we're dealing with.

04:17.464 --> 04:18.505
[Garth grunts]

04:18.591 --> 04:20.011
- Come on. Try again.
- [Garth] No.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.821
- [Madalyn] Come on, Garthy...
- No, stop it.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.715
[Madalyn] Don't you disobey your mother!

04:23.806 --> 04:25.574
[Garth] Or what, you're gonna
take me over your knee?

04:25.598 --> 04:27.827
[Madalyn] Yes, I just might...
[Robin] Stop it, both of you!

04:27.851 --> 04:29.481
[Madalyn sighing]

04:31.980 --> 04:34.650
[Madalyn softly]
God damn it, I have to pee.

04:34.732 --> 04:35.982
Hey, people!

04:36.068 --> 04:40.658
If you don't let me out of here,
I'm gonna piss all over your floor!

04:45.577 --> 04:48.037
[sighs] Lady, you're gonna
need to calm down.

04:48.121 --> 04:51.251
[Madalyn] Calm down?
You want me to calm down, shit for brains?

04:51.333 --> 04:53.561
In case you hadn't noticed,
we've got bags over our heads,

04:53.585 --> 04:56.545
we're all tied up and I gotta pee!

04:56.629 --> 04:59.969
You do what we say and everyone
gets out of here safe and sound.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.470
[Madalyn] Oh, now that sounds
like the big man in charge.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.012
Is that the big man in charge?

05:04.096 --> 05:07.056
Get this goddamn thing off of my head
and show me who you are.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.480
You think you got
the balls to take me on?

05:09.559 --> 05:10.599
[softly] Jesus Christ.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.523
[Madalyn] What?
What's going on?

05:14.606 --> 05:16.206
- Garth, what's going on?
- [Garth sighs]

05:16.274 --> 05:18.154
- Oh, my God.
- Robin.

05:18.235 --> 05:20.235
[Madalyn] Oh, my God,
is that who I think it is?

05:21.488 --> 05:22.698
Fuck.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.070
[sighs]

05:29.371 --> 05:30.831
Hello, Madalyn.

05:31.915 --> 05:34.455
- [line ringing]
- [indistinct chatter]

05:36.419 --> 05:40.049
- [Bill] <i>This is Bill Murray.</i>
- Bill, it's Roy. Roy Collier.

05:40.132 --> 05:41.172
What do you want?

05:42.092 --> 05:44.302
<i>It's your mom... and Robin and Garth.</i>

05:45.220 --> 05:46.390
<i>They've disappeared.</i>

05:47.305 --> 05:48.595
I just saw them in Dallas.

05:48.681 --> 05:49.721
<i>I'm not kidding.</i>

05:49.807 --> 05:52.977
<i>The police said that in order for somebody
to officially be considered missing,</i>

05:53.061 --> 05:55.941
<i>they need somebody in the family
to file a report.</i>

05:56.023 --> 05:57.363
Why would I do that?

05:57.440 --> 06:00.360
Besides, they're probably off
on some crazy trip again.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.703
<i>- No, this is different, Bill.</i>
- Roy...

06:02.779 --> 06:04.859
you know they're not in my life anymore.

06:04.948 --> 06:07.408
And, frankly,
I'd like to keep it that way.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.542
Okay?

06:08.618 --> 06:09.828
<i>Bill...</i>

06:24.801 --> 06:25.931
Ferguson...

06:26.594 --> 06:29.394
I need those 600 words
on the Alamo anniversary by 5:00.

06:29.472 --> 06:33.522
Relax, man. It's the same story I wrote
last year and the year before that.

06:33.601 --> 06:35.914
Well, can't help it
if nothing ever happens in San Antonio.

06:35.938 --> 06:39.478
No, plenty happens in San Antonio.
I just don't get to write about it.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.816
- Where you going?
- [phone ringing]

06:42.735 --> 06:44.315
[sighs] Shit.

06:47.032 --> 06:49.742
- Jack Ferguson.
- [Roy] <i>This is the reporter?</i>

06:49.826 --> 06:51.076
On a good day.

06:51.161 --> 06:54.501
<i>You know Madalyn Murray O'Hair?
She's disappeared.</i>

06:54.581 --> 06:55.831
Madalyn Murray O'Hair?

06:55.915 --> 06:57.825
<i>The damn cops won't do anything.</i>

06:57.917 --> 07:00.337
<i>Only thing I could think to do
was call a reporter.</i>

07:00.420 --> 07:02.710
- Who's this?
<i>- Name's Roy. But I gotta go.</i>

07:02.797 --> 07:06.297
<i>If you wanna know more,
come by 1682 Greystone Drive tonight.</i>

07:06.384 --> 07:08.014
- What...
<i>- I'll be there.</i>

07:08.095 --> 07:09.465
- [dial tone]
- Hello?

07:37.749 --> 07:39.919
[gospel music playing faintly on radio]

07:40.002 --> 07:41.132
[Pup] Madalyn?

07:42.879 --> 07:45.719
Bless this food to our use...

07:45.798 --> 07:47.378
and us to thy service.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.797
- Amen.
- [Mrs. Murray] Amen.

07:50.095 --> 07:53.215
Now, I don't suppose
you found a job today?

07:53.306 --> 07:54.466
[Madalyn] I had an interview.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.885
But I didn't get a law degree
to be a damn receptionist.

07:57.978 --> 08:01.358
[chuckles] You'd be lucky
to be someone's receptionist.

08:01.439 --> 08:03.109
If I were you, I'd start praying.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.731
How do you put up with him, Mother?

08:04.817 --> 08:07.277
The question is, how do I tolerate you?

08:08.196 --> 08:10.116
Living here for free.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.078
- Bringing a bastard into my house.
- Pup!

08:12.617 --> 08:14.787
Don't you ever call my son that.

08:15.870 --> 08:20.250
Sweetie, why don't you just take
your dinner and go on to our room? Hmm?

08:21.334 --> 08:22.884
[Pup] I am sorry, Billy Boy.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.710
I was just trying to make a point
about your momma, huh?

08:31.178 --> 08:33.217
I've got a point I'd like to make.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.345
What else is new?

08:34.431 --> 08:36.471
No, this is important.

08:36.558 --> 08:37.928
Got an announcement.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.602
Getting another grandchild.

08:41.688 --> 08:44.478
That's right. Your precious daughter's
got herself knocked up again.

08:44.566 --> 08:46.026
- Oh, honey, no.
- Yeah.

08:46.109 --> 08:48.989
And the guy's kicked me to the curb again,
saying it's not his,

08:49.071 --> 08:52.661
when I know for a fact
it absolutely is his.

08:52.740 --> 08:53.950
You're an embarrassment.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.911
That's right.
That's right.

08:56.994 --> 08:58.124
Walk away.

08:59.289 --> 09:00.539
Just like they did.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.708
[door opens and slams]

09:08.256 --> 09:09.296
[sighs]

09:09.382 --> 09:10.842
I'm sorry, Mother.

09:10.925 --> 09:15.675
- You wanna tell me what happened?
- I don't know. Condom broke?

09:15.763 --> 09:17.313
You sure you wanna keep it?

09:18.225 --> 09:21.885
I mean, I can take care of Pup,
and you know how he loves little Bill,

09:21.978 --> 09:24.308
and hopefully he'll come around.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.517
He's right.

09:26.691 --> 09:29.531
I got a law degree and no job,
and a kid and no husband.

09:29.611 --> 09:32.661
The only thing I do have is judgment.
I get plenty of that.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.529
Maddy, you made a couple of mistakes,
that's all.

09:35.617 --> 09:39.327
You know, I see these housewives
in their identical homes

09:39.412 --> 09:41.752
with their identical lives, and...

09:43.375 --> 09:46.125
They disgust me, but sometimes I...

09:47.337 --> 09:50.797
I wish I could be like that,
wish I could live like that.

09:50.882 --> 09:52.472
But I can't.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.220
I don't know what to tell you.

09:54.302 --> 09:55.512
Mom, just lie to me.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.555
- Tell me everything's gonna be all right.
- Oh...

10:03.019 --> 10:05.899
Well, I could be a secretary.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.150
[scoffs]

10:07.232 --> 10:08.982
Telephone operator.

10:09.066 --> 10:11.186
You could sell Avon like Ms. Wright.

10:11.903 --> 10:14.453
- [chuckles]
- [protestors chanting indistinctly]

10:14.531 --> 10:17.241
We're just too damn smart for these hicks.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.785
- [chanting] We will fight!
- [young Bill] What's going on?

10:21.538 --> 10:24.248
I'll bet they're going
to the White Tower restaurant.

10:24.332 --> 10:25.382
Why?

10:26.626 --> 10:28.666
Well, Billy Boy... [sighs]

10:29.712 --> 10:32.262
not all people are treated the same
in this world.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.050
Because they're non...

10:34.134 --> 10:36.224
- Noncon...
- Nonconformist?

10:36.303 --> 10:39.143
- Yeah.
- Well, you could say that, I guess.

10:39.222 --> 10:44.142
White Tower won't serve Negroes...
so they're protesting.

10:44.227 --> 10:47.307
And if they protest, will that make
the White Tower serve them?

10:47.397 --> 10:48.977
[scoffing]

10:49.899 --> 10:52.239
No, the owners of that place
are damn racists.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.949
Makes me so mad.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.948
I bet they call themselves
Christians, too.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.176
Grandpa says you might find a job
if you were more Christian.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.030
Ah, your grandpa's full of crap.

11:00.117 --> 11:01.947
Grandpa says you're the one full of crap.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.036
Excuse me?

11:03.120 --> 11:05.474
Well, you're always going on
about what's wrong with people,

11:05.498 --> 11:07.668
but you don't do anything about it.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.500
You just complain.

11:12.129 --> 11:14.129
[news theme playing]

11:20.555 --> 11:22.115
[newscaster] <i>Close to 100 demonstrators</i>

11:25.184 --> 11:28.314
<i>of the White Tower restaurant
in downtown Baltimore.</i>

11:28.396 --> 11:30.476
<i>The activists were met
with some resistance</i>

11:30.565 --> 11:32.645
<i>from supporters of segregation.</i>

11:32.734 --> 11:37.534
[woman] <i>I think that, uh, as much</i>
<i>as we regret it, integration is here,</i>

11:37.614 --> 11:42.584
<i>and I would like to be able to do
as much as I can to prevent it coming.</i>

11:42.660 --> 11:45.250
[newscaster] <i>But one white woman</i>
<i>and her son actually showed up</i>

11:45.330 --> 11:47.210
<i>to march with the Negroes.</i>

11:47.290 --> 11:50.840
<i>The owners of the White Tower restaurant
should be ashamed of themselves.</i>

11:50.918 --> 11:53.628
<i>This is Baltimore, not Nazi Germany.</i>

11:53.713 --> 11:56.173
[newscaster] <i>And what about you,</i>
<i>young man? Why are you here?</i>

11:56.258 --> 11:58.258
[young Bill] <i>I'm here</i>
<i>because I don't like racists,</i>

11:58.343 --> 12:00.433
<i>and because I'm a nonconformist
like my mom.</i>

12:00.512 --> 12:02.142
That's my boy.

12:02.221 --> 12:04.271
What were you thinking?

12:04.349 --> 12:06.109
I was trying to teach
your grandson a lesson.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.272
"Judge not, lest ye be judged."

12:08.353 --> 12:10.313
What about the neighbors?

12:10.397 --> 12:13.477
What do you care
what nosy old Mrs. Mosley thinks?

12:13.566 --> 12:16.566
You really are one selfish SOB.

12:16.653 --> 12:19.703
Just 'cause you read
the goddamn Bible every night,

12:19.781 --> 12:22.991
you think you're
so high and mighty and moral,

12:23.075 --> 12:24.825
when there are people out there

12:24.911 --> 12:27.201
who are actually,
really, truly suffering...

12:27.289 --> 12:29.517
- You know, I've got some cold cuts...
- Mother, it's all...

12:29.541 --> 12:33.251
You have no right
to lecture me about morality.

12:33.336 --> 12:37.086
You can take your morals
and shove them up your ass.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.223
May the Lord have mercy
on your soul, Madalyn.

12:39.301 --> 12:42.141
Ooh, the Lord.
I'm quaking in my boots.

12:42.219 --> 12:44.809
Where was the Lord
when I got knocked up, huh?

12:44.889 --> 12:46.679
Where is the Lord now?

12:49.226 --> 12:51.686
[newscaster continues indistinctly]

12:53.731 --> 12:54.861
[Madalyn] What, Mother?

12:59.362 --> 13:03.032
<i>I believe we need
a spiritual revolution in America.</i>

13:03.115 --> 13:06.035
<i>We need a revolt against materialism,</i>

13:06.118 --> 13:08.198
<i>a revolt against crime,</i>

13:08.287 --> 13:11.417
<i>a revolt against the emphasis on sex,</i>

13:11.499 --> 13:12.879
<i>a revolt against the sins...</i>

13:12.959 --> 13:16.049
[Madalyn] It's like I keep telling you,
it's just case after case down there.

13:16.128 --> 13:17.189
[Mrs. Murray] Such a shame.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.763
And then I've got
this Negro girl with a baby,

13:19.841 --> 13:22.551
who got thrown out of her home,
and there is no place to put her.

13:22.635 --> 13:23.755
I mean, no place whatsoever.

13:23.845 --> 13:24.905
- We have looked...
- [Bill] Mom.

13:24.929 --> 13:27.059
Just a sec, Bill.

13:27.139 --> 13:29.929
No idea why I went into social work.

13:30.017 --> 13:31.887
I thought I could help people.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.608
But I can't.
There's too much red tape...

13:33.688 --> 13:35.207
- [Bill] Mom!
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.691
I said, "Just a sec."

13:38.150 --> 13:40.610
Now you be good for Grandma, right, Garth?

13:41.488 --> 13:44.948
[Billy Graham] <i>You can find everything</i>
<i>that you've been searching for in Christ.</i>

13:45.032 --> 13:49.122
And I'd better not come home and find
my son watching that claptrap with you.

13:49.203 --> 13:51.413
I don't want him getting any ideas.

14:00.297 --> 14:01.917
I'm gonna get in trouble again.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.088
Well, it's not my fault
you missed the bus.

14:06.095 --> 14:09.965
Okay. All right, I'll talk to the teacher
if I have to, okay?

14:11.058 --> 14:14.898
[students] Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name...

14:14.979 --> 14:16.979
- We are not making a habit of this.
- I know.

14:17.064 --> 14:18.542
- You've gotta start getting up earlier.
- I know.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.226
What the hell is that?

14:20.317 --> 14:21.997
Oh, don't tell me
that's the Lord's Prayer.

14:22.069 --> 14:23.409
- Yeah.
- What are you...

14:23.488 --> 14:26.658
- You gotta be kidding me.
- They make us say it every day.

14:26.741 --> 14:28.541
- They make you read the Bible, too?
- Uh-huh.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.971
I told the teacher I don't believe
in prayer and asked to be excused.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.035
And what did she say?

14:32.121 --> 14:33.961
She said we all
have to bow our heads and pray.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.038
[groans] Oh...

14:35.124 --> 14:37.754
[all] ...and the power and the glory.

14:37.835 --> 14:39.915
- Amen.
- What the hell's going on in here?

14:40.004 --> 14:41.134
Excuse me?

14:41.213 --> 14:43.473
If I wanted my son
to learn the Lord's Prayer,

14:43.550 --> 14:45.510
I would've sent him
to goddamn Catholic school.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.473
- Mrs. Murray...
- Ms. Murray.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.564
Ms. Murray...

14:50.598 --> 14:52.138
this is our morning devotion.

14:52.224 --> 14:56.104
Well, I would like my son excused
from the morning devotion.

14:56.187 --> 14:58.187
- You don't want him to...
- Mmm-mmm.

14:58.272 --> 15:00.322
I've never heard of anything
like this in my life.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.940
Well, Mrs.... uh, Lutz, is it?

15:03.945 --> 15:06.315
My son, like myself, is an atheist.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.576
- Isn't that right, Bill?
- Uh-huh.

15:08.658 --> 15:11.868
I cannot excuse your son
from the morning devotion.

15:11.953 --> 15:15.123
It is required by the board,
and it is the law.

15:15.206 --> 15:16.536
The law?

15:16.624 --> 15:19.214
Have you heard about the Constitution,
by any chance?

15:19.293 --> 15:21.133
Kids, I hope
she's not teaching you history,

15:21.212 --> 15:23.672
because, apparently,
she flunked that class.

15:23.756 --> 15:27.046
In the Constitution, there is something
called the First Amendment.

15:27.134 --> 15:30.394
And that protects
the freedom of speech and religion.

15:30.472 --> 15:32.012
Are there any Jews in the class?

15:33.140 --> 15:36.140
Do your parents know
that you are being forced to recite

15:36.227 --> 15:38.097
- this archaic drivel?
- Ms. Murray!

15:38.187 --> 15:40.267
- I'm just trying to make a point.
- Obviously.

15:40.356 --> 15:44.896
The school board cannot force my son
to pray, or anyone else for that matter.

15:44.986 --> 15:46.856
So... sue them.

15:53.828 --> 15:58.288
First of all, can I just say,
it is wonderful to see you all again.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.627
Garth. [chuckles]

16:01.711 --> 16:03.461
Lose a few pounds?
You're looking good.

16:05.089 --> 16:07.259
Robin... did you miss me?

16:08.300 --> 16:10.890
- For fuck's sake, David, get to the point.
- Hey, I'm with you.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.390
I wanna keep this reunion
as brief as possible.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.273
So here's the deal.

16:15.349 --> 16:17.389
- Tomorrow...
- Wait, tomorrow?

16:17.477 --> 16:19.727
- What about the dogs?
- Don't worry, sweetie.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.272
Tomorrow...

16:22.273 --> 16:24.783
you're gonna write us a little check,
and then we will be happy

16:24.859 --> 16:26.859
to get you the hell out of this place.

16:26.944 --> 16:29.114
A check?
[scoffs]

16:29.196 --> 16:31.116
I'm gonna make this easy on you, Madalyn.

16:31.198 --> 16:33.488
What we want is just a drop in the bucket.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.616
[Madalyn] And what is that?

16:35.703 --> 16:36.930
- A million dollars.
- [Madalyn laughs]

16:36.954 --> 16:39.374
For fuck's sake...

16:39.456 --> 16:42.456
- It's not a fucking joke, lady.
- Uh, listen...

16:42.544 --> 16:44.384
I don't know what this guy's told you,

16:44.461 --> 16:47.841
but my organization
is a nonprofit organization.

16:47.924 --> 16:49.514
- There's no money...
- In theory,

16:49.592 --> 16:53.102
American Atheists is a nonprofit, but...
[scoffs]

16:53.179 --> 16:56.179
but we both know that there are
a few offshore accounts

16:56.265 --> 16:58.095
that will not bear that out.

17:01.145 --> 17:03.225
New Zealand, for example.

17:06.943 --> 17:08.532
[sighs heavily]

17:12.156 --> 17:14.906
- [Roy grunts] What is this shit?
- [indistinct rustling]

17:14.992 --> 17:16.742
[dog barking]

17:16.828 --> 17:18.448
- Hello?
- [knocks on door]

17:20.915 --> 17:22.244
Hello?

17:22.333 --> 17:23.383
[dogs barking loudly]

17:23.459 --> 17:24.499
Jesus.

17:27.755 --> 17:31.465
Mr. Ferguson, Roy Collier.
I work for Madalyn.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.601
Where did you get my name?

17:33.678 --> 17:37.178
You covered our protests of the courthouse
nativity scene last Christmas.

17:37.264 --> 17:38.314
[papers rustling]

17:38.390 --> 17:40.430
Thought you could use
a real story for once.

17:40.517 --> 17:42.727
And all three of them, they lived here?

17:42.812 --> 17:44.312
They were inseparable.

17:45.272 --> 17:47.192
Nobody thought that was kind of weird?

17:47.274 --> 17:50.954
Trust me, there's a lot of weird shit
going on in this family.

17:51.696 --> 17:53.446
- Mr. Ferguson...
- Call me Jack.

17:53.530 --> 17:54.820
Jack.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.867
I think something
really bad's happened here,

17:56.951 --> 17:58.751
but nobody seems to believe me.

17:58.828 --> 18:02.538
- Not even the people at American Atheists?
- [sighs] No, she's done this before.

18:02.624 --> 18:05.844
Disappeared for a few weeks,
popped up in Mexico.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.708
They think this may be
another one of her fundraising ploys.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.296
I'd be inclined to believe 'em.

18:10.381 --> 18:12.761
No, she would have left me instructions.

18:12.842 --> 18:14.972
And she never would've left
the dogs behind.

18:15.052 --> 18:18.472
Okay, look, Roy.
This isn't really my area of expertise.

18:18.555 --> 18:19.765
Then why did you come?

18:19.849 --> 18:22.059
Well, I thought
there might be a story here.

18:23.811 --> 18:24.811
Jackpot.

18:29.734 --> 18:31.114
Passports.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.871
Still doesn't prove
that they're not just out of town.

18:41.663 --> 18:44.083
Okay, let's say you're right.
Let's say they were kidnapped.

18:44.165 --> 18:45.825
- Or worse.
- What about Robin's father?

18:45.917 --> 18:46.917
- Bill Jr.?
- Yeah.

18:47.001 --> 18:49.211
He hasn't spoken to his family in years.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.705
His ass won't even
file a missing person's report.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.651
Well, then he should be
at the top of your list.

18:53.675 --> 18:54.795
No. No.

18:54.884 --> 18:59.184
Bill and his mom may have had some issues,
but he would never do anything like this.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.103
Well, then, who would?

19:03.017 --> 19:04.477
Are you kidding?

19:04.560 --> 19:08.060
Do you know how many death threats
this woman would receive in a day?

19:09.398 --> 19:10.438
No.

19:12.276 --> 19:14.566
[woman speaking indistinctly on phone]

19:15.697 --> 19:16.817
Sure.

19:16.906 --> 19:18.826
No. Right.
Uh, no, I know.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.028
Well, I...

19:21.160 --> 19:25.330
Oh. Yeah. No, I... I do know Mr. Epstein
from the Austin branch, right?

19:25.414 --> 19:26.714
Garth, come on.

19:26.791 --> 19:28.671
[Madalyn] Good morning.

19:28.751 --> 19:30.291
Okay.
Uh-huh.

19:30.377 --> 19:33.257
[stammers] Yup. Right, we'll talk then.
Bye-bye. Mmm-hmm.

19:36.383 --> 19:38.013
So... [sighs]

19:40.262 --> 19:42.432
I can only get $600,000.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.684
That's what's in our personal account.

19:44.767 --> 19:45.807
What?

19:46.602 --> 19:47.942
Where is the rest of it?

19:48.020 --> 19:49.770
It's in dummy trusts.

19:50.732 --> 19:52.692
It's in dummy what now?

19:53.693 --> 19:57.113
They have to wire it here, the 600 grand,
from New Zealand next week.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.196
Next week?

19:58.280 --> 20:00.410
And I have to sign for it in person.

20:00.491 --> 20:01.491
[Gary] Hey...

20:03.327 --> 20:04.327
Are you lying?

20:05.079 --> 20:06.749
Gary, calm down.

20:06.831 --> 20:09.211
I'm calm.
He's a big boy.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.591
You didn't plan this very well,
did you, David?

20:12.169 --> 20:14.589
I am in no mood for a jerk-off contest.

20:15.172 --> 20:17.592
Do I need to remind you
who's holding the guns here?

20:19.676 --> 20:24.016
Everybody just needs to settle in...
and try and get along.

20:24.098 --> 20:26.768
Looks like we're gonna be
roommates for a few days.

20:27.351 --> 20:28.391
[Garth sighs]

20:28.477 --> 20:31.397
You don't think
the police are gonna be looking for me?

20:31.480 --> 20:34.860
No, Madalyn, I don't think
anyone's gonna be looking for you.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.282
[Madalyn sighs]

20:39.238 --> 20:40.778
[phone ringing]

20:42.867 --> 20:43.987
William Murray Jr.

20:44.076 --> 20:47.196
Mr. Murray, Jack Ferguson,
<i>San Antonio Daily Journal.</i>

20:47.288 --> 20:49.668
I don't give quotes on my mother,
Mr. Ferguson.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.879
<i>- I assume that's what you're after.</i>
- Uh, sort of.

20:51.959 --> 20:54.129
I'm looking into
your family's disappearance.

20:54.211 --> 20:55.301
<i>Roy Collier call you?</i>

20:56.005 --> 20:57.705
Let me give you some advice, Mr. Ferguson.

20:57.799 --> 20:58.799
<i>Don't waste your time.</i>

20:58.883 --> 21:00.986
<i>You don't wanna look like a fool
when they suddenly show up.</i>

21:01.010 --> 21:02.445
Roy seems to think this is different.

21:02.469 --> 21:05.559
Well, I guess it's possible
they finally left the country for good.

21:05.639 --> 21:08.519
<i>They've been putting money
from American Atheists</i>

21:08.600 --> 21:09.920
<i>into offshore accounts for years.</i>

21:09.977 --> 21:11.307
Embezzlement?

21:11.395 --> 21:13.555
<i>My mother prefers to call it
"creative accounting."</i>

21:13.647 --> 21:15.000
<i>Now, if you'll excuse me, Mr. Ferguson...</i>

21:15.024 --> 21:16.324
Uh, one question.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.530
The dogs...

21:18.610 --> 21:20.530
Roy said that they took them everywhere.

21:20.612 --> 21:22.674
Sure, she treats those things
better than her own family.

21:22.698 --> 21:26.198
<i>Well, that's why he's so worried.
They left them behind.</i>

21:28.245 --> 21:29.575
Goodbye, Mr. Ferguson.

21:35.502 --> 21:38.842

<i>Skirmishes such as this

21:41.175 --> 21:42.610
[Mrs. Murray] Madalyn,
I just don't get this.

21:42.634 --> 21:46.394
I still can't understand why those
children can't say one little prayer.

21:46.472 --> 21:49.182
They can pray all they want to.

21:49.266 --> 21:52.016
- School can't force 'em to.
- Okay, Maddy.

21:52.103 --> 21:53.563
But can't somebody else fight this?

21:53.645 --> 21:55.265
Why does it always have to be you?

21:55.356 --> 21:56.976
Why not me?

21:57.066 --> 21:58.896
- [sighs]
- This is important.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.735
I'm just so worried about Pup.

22:00.820 --> 22:03.200
His health isn't what it used to be.

22:03.280 --> 22:05.660
Well, he better start a-goddamn prayin',

22:05.741 --> 22:08.791
'cause we're gonna take this all the way
to the Supreme Court if we have to.

22:08.870 --> 22:10.513
- [man] Your mother's a whore!
- [glass shattering]

22:10.537 --> 22:12.182
- [Bill] Get the hell off of me!
- [door opens]

22:12.206 --> 22:14.036

22:14.125 --> 22:16.625

No one wants you.

22:16.710 --> 22:18.920
- You go to hell!
- Go, go, go!

22:19.005 --> 22:20.045
[Pup] Madalyn!

22:24.176 --> 22:25.506
[Madalyn sighs]

22:38.357 --> 22:40.187
Come on. [sighs]

22:41.110 --> 22:42.440
Why didn't you tell me?

22:42.528 --> 22:43.568
The kids at school?

22:43.654 --> 22:45.414
- Mmm.
- I can handle it.

22:45.489 --> 22:48.159
- Oh, you think so?
- Yeah, they ambushed me.

22:49.618 --> 22:51.868
Still got a few good elbows
in there, though.

22:53.580 --> 22:55.210
What about the teachers?

22:56.292 --> 22:58.462
- They're ignoring me.
- [scoffs]

22:58.544 --> 23:00.214
They won't call on me anymore.

23:04.425 --> 23:07.255
I don't know, Billy Boy.
Maybe we oughta drop this.

Hmm?

25:58.307 --> 26:00.097

that your sole purpose in life might be
to serve as an argument for birth control?

29:06.828 --> 29:08.788

Just ignore her.

29:08.872 --> 29:10.292
There you are.

29:10.374 --> 29:14.424
A little overcooked,
just like you like them.

29:14.503 --> 29:16.213
[Madalyn] You remembered.

29:16.297 --> 29:19.507
I figured the least we could do
if we're all stuck here together

29:19.591 --> 29:20.631
is be civil.

29:20.717 --> 29:23.297
I wouldn't spit in your ass
if your guts were on fire.

29:23.387 --> 29:25.807
- That civil enough for you?
- [David] Oh, come on.

29:25.889 --> 29:28.479
I'm having a good time.
Who else is having a good time?

29:28.559 --> 29:30.809
- Uh, yeah, sure. I guess.
- Garth.

29:30.894 --> 29:32.774
I mean, he got us video games.

29:32.854 --> 29:36.784
He's right. I brought your medicine,
I got you a change of clothes.

29:36.858 --> 29:41.488
I... I'd say for kidnappers,
we are damn near hospitable.

29:41.572 --> 29:43.952
This is much better than prison, trust me.

29:44.032 --> 29:47.242
[scoffs] Gary was in prison.
How come I didn't see that coming?

29:48.244 --> 29:50.584
You know, you just can't seem
to shut the fuck up.

29:50.664 --> 29:54.544
I bet you saw more cock in the slammer
than a urinal at the Astrodome.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.187
- [David] Hey, hey, hey!
- Oh, go ahead and shoot me.

29:56.211 --> 29:58.131
I'm an awfully big body to hide.

29:58.213 --> 29:59.973
- Gary, put the gun away.
- Open up, Grandma!

30:00.048 --> 30:01.718
- Keep talking.
- [Robin] Gary...

30:01.800 --> 30:05.100
- No, be funny, fucking Grandma. Do it!
- [Robin] Please!

30:05.178 --> 30:06.508
[Robin] Gary, please.

30:11.685 --> 30:14.355

You're gonna owe me.

- Come on. Come on.

30:23.238 --> 30:24.408
[knock on door]

30:28.327 --> 30:30.537
Dave, we need to talk.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.082
- [whispers] Mother.
- What?

30:35.166 --> 30:36.706
- Mother.
- What?

30:36.793 --> 30:37.843
Do you ever stop to think

30:37.919 --> 30:39.939
that if they kill one of us,
they have to kill us all?

30:39.963 --> 30:43.173
This is bullshit, Garth.
And I'm not letting them get away with it.

30:43.258 --> 30:47.348
I know, but if we get the police involved,
you know that the IRS is gonna follow.

30:47.429 --> 30:49.309
And what they want, it's nothing.

30:49.390 --> 30:51.100
So let's just play their game for now,

30:51.182 --> 30:52.952
and we'll figure out a way
to nail them later.

30:52.976 --> 30:54.686
Yeah.
Yeah, he's right, Grandma.

30:54.770 --> 30:56.900
- Yeah, he's right.
- [Garth chuckles]

30:56.980 --> 30:59.150
This one time.
Stop gloating.

31:05.531 --> 31:06.821
That's not good.

31:08.909 --> 31:10.039
It's fine.

31:10.118 --> 31:11.471
They think they're in New Zealand.

31:11.495 --> 31:14.035
You said two days, tops.

31:14.122 --> 31:17.462
And that woman,
she's wound so goddamn tight.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.253
How the fuck we supposed to keep 'em here?

31:19.335 --> 31:21.665
Madalyn's a cripple.
She's not going anywhere.

31:22.673 --> 31:24.433
Robin would never leave her.

31:25.426 --> 31:27.546
And Garth?
[scoffs]

31:27.636 --> 31:31.256
Yeah, Garth can't piss
without his mom holding his dick.

31:33.016 --> 31:34.136
Four days.

31:35.143 --> 31:37.903
We get the money.
We get out of town.

31:40.441 --> 31:41.531
Here.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.528
Get rid of the cars.

31:44.611 --> 31:45.951
Just to be safe.

31:52.828 --> 31:53.998
David...

31:56.122 --> 31:57.332
When this thing comes through,

31:57.416 --> 32:00.166
you're not really serious
about letting them go, right?

32:09.135 --> 32:11.595
[scoffs] He wants you to drop the story?

32:11.680 --> 32:13.600
Well, he doesn't think
there's much more to tell.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.702
Everybody seems to believe
they took off for New Zealand.

32:15.726 --> 32:17.096
I told you, they'd never leave

32:17.185 --> 32:18.287
- without the dogs.
- "Without the dogs"?

32:18.311 --> 32:20.401
Yeah, you may have mentioned that before.

32:20.481 --> 32:21.521
You know...

32:23.108 --> 32:24.988
I don't get it, Roy.

32:25.068 --> 32:26.448
What?

32:26.528 --> 32:28.881
Well, her own son doesn't seem to care
that they're missing.

32:28.905 --> 32:32.985
Everybody else at American Atheists
are pretending like nothing's happened.

32:33.910 --> 32:35.290
What makes you different?

32:36.287 --> 32:40.497
You have any idea what it's like
to grow up black and gay in Texas?

32:40.584 --> 32:42.254
Um, no.

32:42.335 --> 32:43.995
Neither did Madalyn.

32:44.087 --> 32:46.047
But it didn't matter.

32:46.131 --> 32:48.631
When my parents kicked me out...

32:49.635 --> 32:51.425
she was there to take me in.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.020
All right, look.

32:57.017 --> 32:59.937
- I have a PI, owes me a favor, uh...
- [sighs]

33:00.020 --> 33:03.110
Not promising anything,
but I'll see if he can't dig something up.

33:04.608 --> 33:06.228
Thanks.

33:06.317 --> 33:09.277
- [newscaster speaking indistinctly on TV]
- [David whistling]

33:14.117 --> 33:15.447
[humming]

33:22.250 --> 33:24.170
[Madalyn] Jesus, David.

33:24.252 --> 33:27.342
Just as vain as ever, huh?
[laughs]

33:27.422 --> 33:30.052
You sure you're not a homo?
[laughs]

33:30.133 --> 33:33.263
You are the last person
who should be lecturing me about vanity.

33:33.344 --> 33:36.934
I'll lecture you about whatever
I goddamn well please.

33:37.015 --> 33:39.935
I don't know how you expect
to pull this off, David.

33:40.936 --> 33:44.936
I am willing to bet
that after we get our money...

33:45.023 --> 33:47.283
you won't be calling the police.

33:47.358 --> 33:50.318
You wouldn't want to expose
those hidden accounts of yours.

33:51.196 --> 33:54.946
In the meantime, why don't you
take these next few days here

33:55.033 --> 33:58.543
as your own dark night of the soul?

33:58.620 --> 34:00.910
Time for a little self-reflection.

34:00.997 --> 34:04.957
If anyone's in need of self-reflection,
David, that'd be you.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.630
I bet Bill Jr. would beg to differ.

34:22.643 --> 34:25.404
Our guest tonight
is Madalyn Murray O'Hair,

34:25.480 --> 34:28.980
the American Atheist
who removed the Bible from public schools.

34:29.067 --> 34:32.027
She's at the university
for a speaking engagement.

34:32.112 --> 34:34.032
O'Hair, that's new for you, isn't it?

34:34.114 --> 34:38.664
Oh, yeah, I guess we all knew

34:38.744 --> 34:43.164

Uh, we've opened our lines to callers.

34:49.588 --> 34:52.217
Right now we have Charles from Sacramento.
Go ahead, Charles.

34:52.297 --> 34:54.318
- [Charles] <i>Yeah, I wanna ask Mrs. Murray...</i>
- Uh, Murray O'Hair.

34:54.342 --> 34:56.601
<i>How can you look at yourself
in the mirror every day?</i>

34:56.678 --> 34:59.928

<i>Thanks to you, this country's

35:08.481 --> 35:11.231
[Madalyn] Don't these people
have anything more to worry about?

35:11.317 --> 35:17.237
I mean, people are dying every day in
this unholy war we're waging in Vietnam.

35:17.323 --> 35:22.293
And, apparently, this guy's more concerned
with masturbating to my corpse.

35:22.370 --> 35:24.830
Next up, we have Barbara from Mill Valley.

[Barbara] <i>Ms. O'Hair,</i>
<i>if you don't believe in God,</i>

35:27.292 --> 35:29.092

[laughing]

35:31.087 --> 35:35.257
Lady, have I gotta explain
the damn birds and the bees for ya?

35:35.341 --> 35:36.931
It's called sex.

35:37.010 --> 35:40.470
And you can bet
the Virgin Mary was all for it.

35:40.555 --> 35:42.595
Virgin birth, my ass.

35:42.683 --> 35:45.103
[protestors shouting indistinctly]

35:50.649 --> 35:52.109
Jesus loves you, Madalyn.

35:52.776 --> 35:54.316
Aw, and so does Santa Claus.

35:54.402 --> 35:57.112
- [gunshot]

36:02.493 --> 36:04.963
Can you believe it?
Jesus shot at me.

36:05.038 --> 36:07.788
- Goddamn Jesus Christ.
- Uh, Mother.

36:07.874 --> 36:11.094
Oh. Oh, all right. Well, I'm sorry
I used that language again, Susan.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.459
I'll try to clean it up a little bit.

- Susan and I have been talking.
- Bill, no.

36:26.768 --> 36:29.058
Well, I haven't even said
what I'm gonna ask yet.

36:29.145 --> 36:30.475
You wanna abandon me.

36:31.397 --> 36:32.567
Please.

36:33.566 --> 36:36.526
Bill, look at me.
Some freak put me in the hospital.

36:36.611 --> 36:38.241
You're fine.

36:38.321 --> 36:40.451

I... I understand.

36:48.623 --> 36:50.173
Probably very frightening for you,

36:50.250 --> 36:52.644
and we shouldn't have dragged Robin
and Susan through all this.

36:52.668 --> 36:56.668
When we get down to LA, I'm gonna
get you a really nice hotel suite.

36:56.757 --> 36:58.525
- They can stay there...
- No, Mother... Mother!

36:58.549 --> 37:01.089
I have a wife and a child now.

37:02.012 --> 37:04.452

37:06.641 --> 37:09.481
- Right, that's your decision.
- All right.

37:09.560 --> 37:13.730
Mmm-hmm. I just don't know if I can
keep up what I'm doing without you.

37:13.815 --> 37:15.065
[sighs] Oh.

37:15.150 --> 37:18.240
- Well, you got Richard now.
- All he's good for is fucking.

37:18.862 --> 37:19.992
Mom.

37:24.200 --> 37:26.450
Remember that protest at White Tower?

37:28.997 --> 37:30.997
You couldn't have been more than ten.

37:31.917 --> 37:34.497
And that day you said to me,

37:34.585 --> 37:36.165
"If something makes you really mad,

37:36.254 --> 37:39.384
you've gotta go out there
and do something about it."

37:42.260 --> 37:44.100
All my life...

37:44.179 --> 37:48.639
I just wanted one person somewhere,
sometime, to understand me.

37:50.643 --> 37:54.363
And that person turned out to be you.
Hmm?

37:56.107 --> 37:57.567
We're in this together.

37:59.444 --> 38:00.534

46:06.263 --> 46:09.143
I do. Why don't you let me see
how the numbers are here?

46:10.560 --> 46:13.400
Oh, not bad.
We'll do better in Kansas City.

46:13.479 --> 46:15.819
I'll burn the goddamn book in Kansas City.

46:15.898 --> 46:18.188
- Oh, Praise the Lord!
- [laughing]

46:18.275 --> 46:20.105
Thank you, Garth. [chuckles]

46:20.194 --> 46:22.074
I'll keep praying for your soul, Madalyn.

46:22.154 --> 46:24.034
I'll keep cursing yours.

46:24.114 --> 46:26.084
You think we won anyone over?

46:26.867 --> 46:28.697
Oh, I don't know, honey.

46:31.080 --> 46:32.670
Did you hear from your father?

46:34.166 --> 46:39.336
Oh, he'll be back when he's shitfaced
and needs his ass wiped. [chuckles]

46:41.298 --> 46:44.968
He just needed a little break.
We'll see him again soon enough.

46:45.886 --> 46:49.596
Hey, when all this is over,
how about we take a little trip, huh?

46:49.682 --> 46:51.535
[Bill] <i>I spent the last 20 years</i>
<i>trying to escape</i>

46:51.559 --> 46:54.559
<i>the overpowering shadow of my mother.</i>

46:56.397 --> 46:57.517
[sighs]

46:58.733 --> 47:03.573
While she was fighting the world...
I was fighting for my life.

47:07.074 --> 47:10.084
I didn't realize
how bad it had gotten till...

47:10.160 --> 47:12.080
I got out of Austin and...

47:13.038 --> 47:14.998
started locking myself
in the bathroom every night

47:15.082 --> 47:18.292
with a bottle of whiskey
and a bucket of ice.

47:22.297 --> 47:24.217
And then one night, I...

47:26.677 --> 47:28.757
I had this sudden rush of sorrow.

47:34.935 --> 47:36.345
Because I understood.

47:37.354 --> 47:42.114
I understood the, uh... the hatred

47:42.192 --> 47:46.952
and the... the self-pity
that she was feeling.

47:49.450 --> 47:51.330
Because that's what I was feeling.

47:58.208 --> 48:00.038
But I come here, and I...

48:01.295 --> 48:03.005
I see others,

48:03.088 --> 48:05.048
much worse situations than me, and...

48:05.966 --> 48:10.256
you overcome, and you accept them.

48:12.347 --> 48:13.717
And that, uh...

48:17.728 --> 48:19.188
That's what I'm gonna do.

48:23.734 --> 48:25.574
[group] Our Father...

48:25.653 --> 48:29.243
[Bill] ...who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

48:29.323 --> 48:31.533
[all] Thy kingdom come,

48:31.617 --> 48:34.947
thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

48:36.163 --> 48:41.343
Give us this day our daily bread,
forgive us our trespasses,

48:41.418 --> 48:44.208
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

48:45.214 --> 48:49.554
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

48:50.302 --> 48:55.482
For thine is the kingdom and the power
and the glory...

48:55.558 --> 48:57.268
forever and ever...

48:57.351 --> 48:59.231
[group] Amen.

48:59.311 --> 49:00.521
[Bill] Amen.

49:04.066 --> 49:07.236
Frank, I need another day
on the Riverwalk article.

49:07.319 --> 49:08.964
I just got a new lead on the O'Hair story.

49:08.988 --> 49:09.988
- Frank, listen.
- Jack...

49:10.072 --> 49:12.622
Robin Murray's Porsche
just turned up abandoned at the airport

49:12.700 --> 49:16.450
and Garth's car sold to some guy
out by Canyon Lake. I mean, come on.

49:18.623 --> 49:20.173
Follow it up.

49:20.249 --> 49:22.289
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

49:22.376 --> 49:24.456
Frank! I love you!

49:27.464 --> 49:28.804
All right.

49:30.843 --> 49:32.973
[man] Nope.
I didn't buy it from him.

49:33.053 --> 49:35.183
- You sure?
- Positive.

49:35.264 --> 49:38.314
It was a short guy.
He was younger, had dark hair.

49:38.392 --> 49:40.442
All right.
If I sent a sketch artist to your house,

49:40.520 --> 49:42.200
would you be willing to sit down with him?

49:42.271 --> 49:45.731
- Sure. [sighs]
- Thanks, Mr. Sparrow.

49:47.484 --> 49:49.034
I don't get it.

49:49.111 --> 49:52.071
What kind of religious nut
goes off and sells a stolen car?

49:52.156 --> 49:54.366
Well, maybe this isn't the work
of a religious nut.

49:54.449 --> 49:55.659
What do you mean?

49:56.451 --> 49:59.451
Well, Madalyn was stashing
loads of cash, right?

49:59.539 --> 50:00.669
Mmm.

50:00.748 --> 50:02.998
Makes for the greatest motive of all.

50:03.918 --> 50:04.998
Greed.

50:11.341 --> 50:13.641
This is just like the old days.

50:14.679 --> 50:16.759
You used to let me win.

50:18.348 --> 50:20.518
You were the boss.
I had to.

50:21.686 --> 50:24.096
Does that mean
I'm supposed to let you win now?

50:24.188 --> 50:25.518
You do have the gun.

50:26.982 --> 50:30.702
And we all know what that means.
Compensating for a very small cock.

50:30.778 --> 50:32.488
- Right, Red?
- [both chuckle]

50:32.572 --> 50:34.507
- That's what you always say, Grandma.
- [Madalyn chuckles]

50:34.531 --> 50:36.951
Oh, come on, Madalyn.
You can do better than that.

50:37.034 --> 50:40.334
I don't waste my best lines
on small-time crooks.

50:41.496 --> 50:44.366
You're just as much of a crook as I am,

50:44.458 --> 50:47.088
rippin' people off
in the name of your cause.

50:47.169 --> 50:48.419
That is bullcrap!

50:49.379 --> 50:53.929
I have devoted my life
to protecting the First Amendment.

50:55.052 --> 50:57.052
The things I've had to endure.

50:58.472 --> 51:01.022
Made a little money along the way.
I deserve it.

51:01.100 --> 51:02.270
You are so full of yourself,

51:02.351 --> 51:05.351
you can't see
the fucking forest for the trees.

51:06.731 --> 51:08.861
While you're out fighting the world,

51:08.941 --> 51:11.991
you're making real enemies
right under your nose.

51:12.069 --> 51:16.119
You get a load of that, Red?
David Waters is lecturing me.

51:16.198 --> 51:17.318
[Madalyn laughs]

51:17.407 --> 51:21.117
Your own son would tell you
the exact same thing.

51:21.203 --> 51:22.373
And...

51:25.374 --> 51:26.504
gin.

51:29.920 --> 51:31.130
[sighs]

51:34.008 --> 51:37.008
<i>I led a life wasted
without faith in the Lord.</i>

51:38.804 --> 51:42.274
<i>And I hope I can right
some of the wrongs I caused.</i>

51:42.349 --> 51:45.059
<i>I see my mother as a sinner now.</i>

51:45.144 --> 51:50.614
<i>She demanded things of God,
and when he refused her requests, well...</i>

51:50.691 --> 51:52.481
<i>she began to battle with him openly.</i>

51:53.736 --> 51:57.946
<i>Now all she cares about is...
getting wealthy by hating God.</i>

51:58.573 --> 52:00.093
[interviewer] <i>Do you love your mother?</i>

52:00.159 --> 52:02.829
[Bill] <i>Oh, I love my mother.</i>
<i>I forgive my mother.</i>

52:03.829 --> 52:06.209
<i>But I'm not proud
of what she did to this country.</i>

52:06.290 --> 52:07.650
[interviewer] <i>Do you pray for her?</i>

52:07.708 --> 52:09.168
[Bill] <i>I wish I could pray for her.</i>

52:09.251 --> 52:10.251
Turn it off.

52:10.335 --> 52:12.415
[Bill] <i>But I'm afraid</i>
<i>it wouldn't do any good.</i>

52:16.759 --> 52:19.799
Sold out to the highest bidder,
the goddamn church.

52:22.431 --> 52:23.471
Mother.

52:24.975 --> 52:27.635
I've been called
every dirty name in the book.

52:27.728 --> 52:30.478
There's not a day goes by
without a death threat.

52:32.858 --> 52:35.608
None of it hurt, but this...
This...

52:36.528 --> 52:37.608
[thumps table]

52:40.991 --> 52:43.331
Garth, am I really that bad of a mother?

52:44.494 --> 52:45.664
No.

52:46.663 --> 52:49.963
Mother, I will always be here.

52:52.962 --> 52:55.672
- We'll both always be here.
- [Madalyn] Oh...

52:56.841 --> 52:58.261
[sighs]

53:00.761 --> 53:02.051
[sniffles]

53:06.100 --> 53:07.430
[phone ringing]

53:09.561 --> 53:10.901
Mr. Waters.

53:16.902 --> 53:17.952
[Madalyn] Thank you, Roy.

53:19.571 --> 53:21.821
- Ms. O'Hair, it is a pleasure.
- [laughs]

53:21.907 --> 53:24.737
Oh, well, have a seat.
[clears throat]

53:25.660 --> 53:27.660
I saw you on <i>Carson</i> last week.

53:27.747 --> 53:31.037
[chuckles] I love the way
you shut Billy Graham up.

53:31.125 --> 53:34.625
Oh, thank you.
It was a little easier than it looked.

53:34.711 --> 53:35.881
Now you're just being modest.

53:35.963 --> 53:39.133
That preacher's more full of shit
than a Christmas turkey, that's for sure.

53:39.216 --> 53:42.636
Oh, hell, he's more full of shit
than a goddamn humpback whale!

53:42.719 --> 53:44.259
[both laughing]

53:46.891 --> 53:52.731
So... you're here about the, uh,
office management position?

53:52.813 --> 53:55.983
- [clicks tongue] Yes, ma'am.
- Yeah, you sure you, uh, wanna join us?

53:56.066 --> 53:58.026
Right now, we're holding
this place together

53:58.110 --> 53:59.570
with bailing wire and chewing gum.

53:59.653 --> 54:02.243
I have held together more with less.

54:02.322 --> 54:06.292
My son, Bill, he used to, uh,
run the place.

54:06.368 --> 54:09.748
But, uh... he screwed me over.

54:12.041 --> 54:16.551
Oh, now those goddamn zombie
twelve-steppers got a hold of him and...

54:17.797 --> 54:20.417
Do you, uh, drink, Mr. Waters?

54:21.508 --> 54:24.178
I do have a few of the usual vices.

54:24.261 --> 54:25.261
Oh, good.

54:27.181 --> 54:30.391
'Cause I do not go in
for that teetotalin' crap.

54:30.475 --> 54:31.975
[both chuckle]

54:35.397 --> 54:37.067
There we go.

54:37.149 --> 54:38.319
Here's to.

54:40.945 --> 54:41.945
[David sighs]

54:42.029 --> 54:47.659
It has been mentioned that you, uh...
spent some time in the Illinois State Pen.

54:49.036 --> 54:53.116
[stammers] Just a few petty crimes...
when I was younger.

54:56.793 --> 54:57.923
Well...

54:59.338 --> 55:04.628
if Hail Marys really could absolve us...
we'd all be goddamn murderers.

55:05.385 --> 55:07.255
[both chuckle]

55:10.182 --> 55:13.732
Now the first thing she wants you to do
is help get the books in order.

55:13.810 --> 55:17.020
We usually get the statements from
Bank of Austin on the third of the month.

55:17.106 --> 55:19.016
This is where we keep the ledger.

55:19.108 --> 55:22.738
You'll have the only key, besides me.

55:23.904 --> 55:27.074
You'll register all processed checks here.

55:27.157 --> 55:29.157
Wait, these are all donations?

55:29.243 --> 55:30.243
That's right.

55:31.620 --> 55:35.750
There's a check here for $20,000.
Another for 12.

55:35.832 --> 55:37.172
I know.

55:37.251 --> 55:40.461
In God we trust.
Right?

55:40.545 --> 55:42.915
[both laughing]

55:43.840 --> 55:45.300
[Roy grunts and sighs]

55:46.218 --> 55:47.588
Ooh! Mmm.

55:49.721 --> 55:51.101
Good luck.

55:58.647 --> 56:00.607
[Madalyn sighs]

56:02.943 --> 56:04.653
Mmm, what's going on?

56:04.736 --> 56:06.406
The money made it out of New Zealand.

56:06.488 --> 56:07.908
[groaning]

56:08.865 --> 56:09.865
[grunts]

56:11.160 --> 56:12.660
It won't be long now.

56:16.456 --> 56:18.376
[chuckles] It's about time.

56:22.296 --> 56:23.666
The van's out back.

56:25.674 --> 56:27.384
Garth...

56:27.467 --> 56:31.637
you try anything... anything,
Madalyn and Robin are dead.

56:31.721 --> 56:33.061
No, I got it.

56:33.140 --> 56:34.180
Let's go.

56:36.393 --> 56:37.393
Bye, Mother.

56:37.477 --> 56:39.897
- You be careful, Garth.
- [Garth] Okay.

56:45.694 --> 56:48.864
You know those bills are gonna be marked.
[scoffs]

56:48.948 --> 56:50.568
They're getting a cashier's check.

56:50.657 --> 56:51.827
[Madalyn scoffs]

56:51.908 --> 56:56.868
Then we're using that to buy gold coins.
Something that can't be traced.

57:01.335 --> 57:03.915
- Here you go, Grandma.
- Thank you, darlin'.

57:05.922 --> 57:07.722
[groans softly]

57:12.471 --> 57:14.931
Well, it looks like
you might have me here.

57:16.600 --> 57:17.600
'Night.

57:21.981 --> 57:23.901
[mutters] Wait a minute.

57:26.526 --> 57:27.606
[chuckles]

57:28.528 --> 57:29.898
Gin.

57:32.282 --> 57:33.622
You'll win next time.

57:33.700 --> 57:34.802
- [scoffing] Yeah.
- [chuckling]

57:34.826 --> 57:36.906
Sure, I'll win one of these days.

57:41.125 --> 57:43.495
You've done a real good job here, David.

57:44.503 --> 57:45.923
But, uh...

57:46.838 --> 57:49.128
I want you to know I did some, uh...

57:50.550 --> 57:51.590
digging...

57:52.511 --> 57:53.971
into your record.

57:56.556 --> 57:58.806
True you were picked up for hustling?

58:03.772 --> 58:06.902
I told you I am trying
to put all that behind me.

58:08.652 --> 58:11.032
I don't give a shit
what you do with your pecker.

58:12.322 --> 58:13.742
But, David...

58:16.243 --> 58:17.453
you killed a man.

58:21.331 --> 58:22.621
Now, tell me about him.

58:24.751 --> 58:26.051
Just between us.

58:28.088 --> 58:29.088
Hmm?

58:31.258 --> 58:33.718
I didn't have a picture-perfect childhood,
Madalyn.

58:35.804 --> 58:37.434
My mother was a prostitute.

58:38.973 --> 58:42.193
And she was in and out of prison
so much that I'd do

58:42.269 --> 58:45.019
whatever I had to do to survive.

58:46.023 --> 58:47.153
[sighs]

58:47.232 --> 58:50.782
I hooked up with this gang.
I started stealing here and there, and...

58:51.361 --> 58:55.281
this guy we were with got caught
after this liquor store job we did.

58:56.408 --> 58:57.658
He turned on me.

58:58.743 --> 59:00.453
[chuckles]

59:00.537 --> 59:04.037
I may not believe in God,
but I do believe in karma.

59:05.084 --> 59:07.044
All that crap about past lives?

59:08.212 --> 59:09.212
Yeah, well...

59:11.798 --> 59:13.218
maybe not karma.

59:17.512 --> 59:18.682
Retaliation.

59:21.516 --> 59:23.096
I was gonna teach this guy a lesson.

59:24.478 --> 59:26.978
But when I started with that tire iron...

59:28.398 --> 59:30.188
I don't know, I just...

59:32.694 --> 59:34.204
I lost control.

59:38.117 --> 59:40.907
[sighs] I got 30 years,
but I only did half.

59:42.036 --> 59:43.326
Got out for good behavior.

59:44.748 --> 59:47.418
And I swore
I would never lose control again.

59:52.297 --> 59:53.337
Thank you.

59:54.633 --> 59:55.683
Mmm-hmm.

59:57.051 --> 01:00:00.891
Thank you for telling me
the fucking truth.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:04.600
[scoffs]

01:00:04.684 --> 01:00:08.114
Yeah, you live long enough
and you lose faith in people.

01:00:08.188 --> 01:00:11.438
- Not that I ever had much faith in anyone.
- [chuckles]

01:00:11.525 --> 01:00:12.645
But...

01:00:15.279 --> 01:00:16.949
you have impressed me, David.

01:00:19.408 --> 01:00:22.868
Starting to wish Bill Jr.
Could've turned out more like you.

01:00:23.953 --> 01:00:25.713
He really hurt you, huh?

01:00:28.041 --> 01:00:29.671
He betrayed me.

01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:32.711
That's what men do.
Betray me.

01:00:38.302 --> 01:00:42.262
But, no, David, he didn't hurt me.

01:00:43.682 --> 01:00:45.642
Nobody can really hurt me.

01:00:50.147 --> 01:00:53.857
Now that I trust you,
I wanna show you something.

01:01:01.408 --> 01:01:03.488
I'm giving you a promotion, David.

01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:08.327
So far, you've been keeping track
of most of our donations

01:01:08.415 --> 01:01:11.915
in the official ledger book.

01:01:12.001 --> 01:01:15.381
I say most of them because...

01:01:15.464 --> 01:01:18.594
this is our unofficial ledger.

01:01:21.761 --> 01:01:24.391
I'll keep your secrets, you keep mine.

01:01:26.558 --> 01:01:28.808
[both chuckle]

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:34.573
[knock on door]

01:01:34.649 --> 01:01:35.939
[door opens]

01:01:39.613 --> 01:01:41.113
[Gary sighs]

01:01:54.836 --> 01:01:55.836
Where are the rest?

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:57.260
In the trunk.

01:01:58.172 --> 01:02:00.972
Well, at least $400,000 of it is.

01:02:03.512 --> 01:02:06.472
Four hundred?
Gary, what the hell?

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:09.136
The fucking guy didn't have enough.

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:13.150
We get the rest next week.

01:02:15.524 --> 01:02:16.824
Shit.

01:02:19.403 --> 01:02:20.403
Shit.

01:02:21.488 --> 01:02:23.988
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

01:02:24.073 --> 01:02:25.913
[grunting]

01:02:29.496 --> 01:02:31.666
Is that really necessary?

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:34.128
Oh, don't tell me it's another hiccup.
[scoffs]

01:02:34.208 --> 01:02:36.145
[Garth] We have to wait
for another shipment of coins.

01:02:36.169 --> 01:02:37.169
What?

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:39.054
They'll be here next Tuesday.

01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:41.930
Oh, for...
This is getting ridiculous.

01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:46.099
- Shut up. You're not in charge here.
- [Madalyn laughing]

01:02:46.179 --> 01:02:49.269
All right, I got it. I got it.
You're the big boss.

01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:52.439
But God damn it, David,
if you aren't fucking up this job

01:02:52.519 --> 01:02:53.913
like everything else you've ever done.

01:02:53.937 --> 01:02:55.357
Mother!

01:02:55.439 --> 01:02:57.269
Oh, pfft.
Ahh!

01:02:57.357 --> 01:03:00.567
If I shot you in the head right now,
do you think anyone would care?

01:03:00.652 --> 01:03:03.782
The state of Texas would probably
give me a fucking medal.

01:03:13.707 --> 01:03:14.827
Look at this.

01:03:16.376 --> 01:03:19.496
$625,000 is missing
from the New Zealand account.

01:03:20.672 --> 01:03:22.592
Withdrawn right after they disappeared.

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:40.725
I say we take the coins we've got
and get out of town.

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:43.238
They've got nothing.

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:46.370
If anything, this is just further proof
that they took the money and ran.

01:03:46.448 --> 01:03:47.618
Oh, fuck.

01:03:48.617 --> 01:03:51.867
We've got two more days
before the second shipment comes through.

01:03:51.953 --> 01:03:55.673
And we have come too far
to let a second-page story get in our way.

01:04:03.382 --> 01:04:07.012
Well, thank you for finally
coming in here, Bill. Appreciate it.

01:04:07.093 --> 01:04:09.683
When you told me about the dogs,
I knew something wasn't right.

01:04:10.597 --> 01:04:13.677
So, why'd it take you so long
to file a report?

01:04:15.602 --> 01:04:17.232
It's complicated.
[chuckles]

01:04:18.146 --> 01:04:21.066
My mother turned my own daughter
against me...

01:04:22.901 --> 01:04:24.031
[sighs]

01:04:25.319 --> 01:04:26.859
What did the cops say?

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:32.118
They told me they would get back to me
if anything turned up.

01:04:32.201 --> 01:04:33.951
Wish I could say I was surprised.

01:04:35.163 --> 01:04:38.713
So I sent a sketch artist down to work
with the guy who bought Garth's car.

01:04:39.751 --> 01:04:42.461
Should have something soon.
I would love for you to take a look.

01:04:42.546 --> 01:04:43.586
Of course.

01:04:45.131 --> 01:04:47.631
Oh, this money that's gone missing,

01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:49.797
do you have any idea
who could've had access to that?

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:52.096
- Accountants? Lawyers?
- Mmm.

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:55.140
All her finances were done in-house
at American Atheists.

01:04:56.184 --> 01:04:59.694
You know...
if somebody did something to them...

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:02.690
it's probably someone from that place.

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:06.190
My mother pissed off a lot of people.

01:05:07.946 --> 01:05:09.946
Especially those she was closest to.

01:05:14.118 --> 01:05:17.708
- [Christmas music playing]
- [clears throat] Uh, excuse me, uh...

01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:20.879
I just want to say American Atheists
has had a wonderful year, and...

01:05:20.959 --> 01:05:22.589
that would not be so without all of you.

01:05:22.669 --> 01:05:26.419
So, thank you,
and a very happy winter solstice.

01:05:26.506 --> 01:05:29.796
- Strike up the carols! [laughs]
- [people cheering]

01:05:31.135 --> 01:05:35.555
Mother loves Christmas.
She really, really does.

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:39.810
Oh, and you in your sweater.
So darling.

01:05:39.894 --> 01:05:41.872
- Will you get me a refill, Garthy?
- [Garth] Of course.

01:05:41.896 --> 01:05:45.106
- I'll go check on those cookies.
- Okay. [chuckles]

01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:50.319
The membership numbers are down,
but the money is not.

01:05:50.404 --> 01:05:53.914
The way Madalyn gets these rich,
dying atheists

01:05:53.992 --> 01:05:56.042
to leave her their entire estates...

01:05:56.119 --> 01:05:58.789
It's a hell of a way to make a living.

01:06:00.248 --> 01:06:02.418
She's not gonna live forever.

01:06:02.501 --> 01:06:04.791
And I don't know what she did to Bill,

01:06:04.878 --> 01:06:08.208
but if I was him, I would have suffered
through until she kicked the bucket,

01:06:08.297 --> 01:06:10.417
and then I would've taken
the whole thing for myself.

01:06:10.509 --> 01:06:14.139
[chuckling] I mean, Garth's not gonna
take over. Can you imagine?

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:15.531
[imitating Garth] "Hello, people,

01:06:15.555 --> 01:06:18.475
we need to start fighting
for the freedom of religion."

01:06:18.558 --> 01:06:20.018
Not funny, David.

01:06:21.435 --> 01:06:22.895
See anybody laughing?

01:06:25.106 --> 01:06:26.606
No more for him, huh?

01:06:35.534 --> 01:06:37.494
Madalyn, sorry.

01:06:37.577 --> 01:06:40.037
I don't wanna hear your excuses.

01:06:40.121 --> 01:06:42.581
Right now,
all I want out of you is breathing.

01:06:42.666 --> 01:06:43.956
Very little of that.

01:06:44.042 --> 01:06:46.922
Come on.
I just had a little bit too much to drink.

01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:49.553
Oh, I am assuming
it was the drink talking,

01:06:49.631 --> 01:06:52.341
otherwise I would fire your ass.

01:06:52.425 --> 01:06:55.215
What?
You wanna get rid of me?

01:06:55.303 --> 01:06:57.433
- [Madalyn sighs]
- Go ahead.

01:06:58.431 --> 01:07:01.691
But I know a lot of secrets
about the American Atheists.

01:07:01.768 --> 01:07:05.608
Secrets that might interest
the IRS in particular.

01:07:06.606 --> 01:07:08.226
Are you threatening me?

01:07:10.026 --> 01:07:12.526
Go, tell the IRS whatever you want.

01:07:12.612 --> 01:07:15.202
Scream it from the mountaintops.

01:07:15.281 --> 01:07:17.531
You think they're gonna believe
a fucking felon?

01:07:18.577 --> 01:07:21.117
Get out of here.
You're ruining my holiday party.

01:07:23.247 --> 01:07:24.457
[sighs]

01:07:36.469 --> 01:07:39.009
You really can be pathetic, you know.

01:07:39.931 --> 01:07:44.441
You just wanna be the momma I never had,
give us both a second chance.

01:07:44.518 --> 01:07:47.018
Well, let me tell you something
about my momma.

01:07:48.231 --> 01:07:50.731
I beat the shit out of her.

01:07:50.817 --> 01:07:52.647
I beat her to a bloody pulp.

01:07:52.736 --> 01:07:55.316
You think your son Bill hurt you?

01:07:55.404 --> 01:07:56.994
Nah.

01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:58.783
Not like I hurt her.

01:07:59.701 --> 01:08:01.201
[sobbing]

01:08:04.538 --> 01:08:05.788
[Madalyn] Garth!

01:08:05.874 --> 01:08:09.174
David Waters is a convicted felon.

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:10.962
He's a murderer.

01:08:11.045 --> 01:08:14.165
And his mother was a goddamn whore.

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:16.796
And she's not the only one
that sucked cocks for money.

01:08:16.885 --> 01:08:19.595
Isn't that right, David?
Isn't that right? You sucked cock...

01:08:20.179 --> 01:08:22.889
Don't fuck with me, Madalyn.
Don't fuck with me.

01:08:22.974 --> 01:08:25.524
- [dogs barking]
- [Robin] Are you okay?

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:27.850
Son of a bitch.

01:08:42.243 --> 01:08:44.953
- [commentator] <i>Hello, football fans...</i>
- [knock on door]

01:08:45.037 --> 01:08:47.578
[commentator continues indistinctly]

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:56.258
We got beer, vodka, cigs.

01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:57.470
Finally.

01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:59.300
[David sighs]

01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:01.595
[Madalyn] Hope you didn't forget
about me, Danny.

01:09:03.264 --> 01:09:04.854
No, I did not.

01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:07.099
[Madalyn grunting] Oh, hey.

01:09:10.104 --> 01:09:11.444
[chuckles]

01:09:15.276 --> 01:09:16.606
Sorry it ain't a martini.

01:09:16.694 --> 01:09:18.444
Oh, it's the good stuff.

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:23.238
Yeah.

01:09:24.285 --> 01:09:25.745
My Billy Boy...

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:29.332
he used to mix a mean Manhattan.

01:09:34.462 --> 01:09:36.131
Here's to new friends.

01:09:39.550 --> 01:09:41.390
You're all right, Danny Fry.

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:48.430
Mmm.

01:09:48.517 --> 01:09:49.977
[sighs]

01:09:50.895 --> 01:09:53.975
You know, I'm real sorry
we're putting you through all this.

01:09:54.064 --> 01:09:56.565
It's not you.
It's David.

01:09:57.276 --> 01:09:59.696
I'd watch your ass around him
if I were you.

01:09:59.779 --> 01:10:01.279
You know, I trusted him.

01:10:01.364 --> 01:10:02.704
[chuckles] Look where it got me.

01:10:06.786 --> 01:10:11.116
I'm, uh... heading to Florida next week

01:10:11.833 --> 01:10:13.463
for my daughter's fifth birthday.

01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:16.547
I'm using my take
to set up her college fund.

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:22.049
Yeah. She's awful sweet.

01:10:23.177 --> 01:10:26.137
And lucky to have you for a father.

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:27.272
Thanks.

01:10:30.518 --> 01:10:31.938
In the end...

01:10:33.437 --> 01:10:35.187
family is all we got.

01:10:55.501 --> 01:10:57.051
[phone ringing]

01:11:00.631 --> 01:11:02.341
- [Roy faintly] Hello.
- [Bill sighs]

01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:08.682
- [Roy] All right, sounds good.
- [dog barking]

01:11:09.891 --> 01:11:10.931
Jack just called.

01:11:11.017 --> 01:11:13.387
He has the sketch of the guy
who sold Garth's car.

01:11:23.612 --> 01:11:25.072
Who the fuck is that?

01:11:37.919 --> 01:11:40.589
[showerhead trickling]

01:11:49.430 --> 01:11:50.430
Get out!

01:12:06.865 --> 01:12:08.065
[line ringing]

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:10.037
[on recording] <i>This is Bob Fry.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

01:12:10.076 --> 01:12:11.156
[answering machine beeps]

01:12:11.244 --> 01:12:14.214
[chuckling] Hey, Bob, it's, uh...
it's Danny.

01:12:14.288 --> 01:12:18.248
Um... You know, I was actually just headed
back to Florida just now, but, um...

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:21.820
I've got a couple things
I gotta tie up still here in Texas.

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:23.300
So, uh...

01:12:24.465 --> 01:12:26.545
But I'm gonna be sending you a letter.

01:12:26.634 --> 01:12:31.184
And if you could just hang onto it for me,
that would be great.

01:12:31.264 --> 01:12:33.184
Okay, thanks.
Bye.

01:12:36.685 --> 01:12:37.895
[sighs]

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:54.329
[Garth sighs]

01:12:54.412 --> 01:12:55.412
Garth?

01:12:56.497 --> 01:12:57.747
Yes, Mother?

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:01.750
I know you don't like me very much.

01:13:03.296 --> 01:13:05.416
That's not true, Mother.

01:13:06.049 --> 01:13:08.889
Well, you call me names behind my back.

01:13:08.968 --> 01:13:11.178
You mean like "fat cunt"?

01:13:11.262 --> 01:13:13.262
You call me "fat cunt"?

01:13:13.347 --> 01:13:14.467
Yeah.

01:13:15.141 --> 01:13:17.021
Well, you've called me worse.

01:13:18.895 --> 01:13:20.265
I suppose.

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:25.030
It doesn't mean anything, you know that.

01:13:26.277 --> 01:13:27.857
What about you, Red?

01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:33.080
You hate me for taking you
away from your father?

01:13:33.159 --> 01:13:34.829
You didn't take me away from him.

01:13:39.873 --> 01:13:41.963
I was too hard on him.

01:13:43.836 --> 01:13:46.126
I'm too hard on all of you.

01:13:47.798 --> 01:13:50.758
You're only hard on us
because you believe we can be great.

01:13:51.677 --> 01:13:52.887
[chuckles softly]

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:56.220
I love you two.

01:13:57.183 --> 01:13:58.273
Uh-huh.

01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:04.936
Everything I've ever done, I...
I've done for you kids.

01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:07.862
Bill, too.

01:14:12.823 --> 01:14:14.163
What do you say?

01:14:15.409 --> 01:14:16.739
When we get out of this,

01:14:16.827 --> 01:14:22.127
we take a drive down to Dallas
and visit your father, hmm?

01:14:23.167 --> 01:14:25.127
- Are you serious?
- I am.

01:14:25.211 --> 01:14:27.511
And if the bastard refuses to see us,

01:14:27.588 --> 01:14:30.758
[chuckling] well, I'll just bang down
the goddamn door.

01:14:30.841 --> 01:14:31.841
[all chuckling]

01:14:32.843 --> 01:14:35.013
- Now, that I'd like to see.
- [laughs]

01:14:51.029 --> 01:14:52.489
[door opens]

01:16:00.431 --> 01:16:01.641
[fridge opens]

01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:08.773
[fridge closes]

01:16:36.467 --> 01:16:37.887
I'm gonna miss you, Red.

01:16:39.262 --> 01:16:40.472
Don't call me that.

01:16:43.807 --> 01:16:44.847
No.

01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:51.145
No! No!

01:16:58.656 --> 01:16:59.816
[news theme playing]

01:16:59.907 --> 01:17:03.327
[newscaster] <i>She called herself</i>
<i>the most hated woman in America.</i>

01:17:03.411 --> 01:17:07.291
<i>Tonight, the incredible case
of Madalyn Murray O'Hair.</i>

01:17:08.416 --> 01:17:10.956
[reporter] <i>In 1963, Madalyn Murray O'Hair</i>

01:17:11.043 --> 01:17:13.003
<i>found the cause
that would make her famous.</i>

01:17:13.086 --> 01:17:14.666
<i>And some say, rich.</i>

01:17:14.755 --> 01:17:18.425
<i>She filed a lawsuit against
the Baltimore public school board.</i>

01:17:18.509 --> 01:17:20.839
<i>The case would go
all the way to the Supreme Court</i>

01:17:20.928 --> 01:17:23.348
<i>in a landmark ruling
that banned prayer in schools.</i>

01:17:23.431 --> 01:17:25.271
<i>Over the next three decades,</i>

01:17:25.349 --> 01:17:28.849
<i>no one person has been thought
a bigger threat to religion.</i>

01:17:28.936 --> 01:17:33.226
<i>In 1995, Madalyn was 77 years old,
in failing health,</i>

01:17:33.316 --> 01:17:36.106
<i>and likely would've spent
her remaining years in relative obscurity.</i>

01:17:36.777 --> 01:17:38.277
<i>Except that, before she could die,</i>

01:17:38.362 --> 01:17:41.532
<i>the nation's most famous atheist
suddenly vanished.</i>

01:17:42.450 --> 01:17:44.719
[Jack] <i>Well, the thing that strikes you</i>
<i>is there was no panic</i>

01:17:44.743 --> 01:17:46.753
<i>when the Murray O'Hairs disappeared.</i>

01:17:46.829 --> 01:17:48.999
<i>There was no real effort to find them.
Uh...</i>

01:17:49.081 --> 01:17:51.541
<i>Yet there was over $600,000 missing,</i>

01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:53.285
<i>Robin's car was abandoned,</i>

01:17:53.377 --> 01:17:56.797
<i>and another was sold
by a mysterious stranger.</i>

01:17:57.423 --> 01:17:59.723
[reporter] <i>Mark Sparrow answered</i>
<i>the ad in the newspaper</i>

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.510
<i>and thought he'd found a steal of a deal</i>

01:18:01.594 --> 01:18:05.144
<i>since the car was priced
$5,000 below Blue Book value.</i>

01:18:05.223 --> 01:18:07.433
<i>But although
Garth Murray's signature appears</i>

01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:09.686
<i>- on the title of transfer documents...</i>
- Danny?

01:18:09.768 --> 01:18:13.728
<i>Sparrow is certain that the man
who sold him the car was not Garth Murray.</i>

01:18:15.233 --> 01:18:18.073
[Bob] Right before Danny disappeared,
I got a call.

01:18:18.151 --> 01:18:19.951
He told me he was sending a letter.

01:18:22.114 --> 01:18:23.494
There weren't many details.

01:18:24.450 --> 01:18:28.910
But he said he and a guy named Gary Karr
were in on a kidnapping scheme,

01:18:28.996 --> 01:18:31.076
brought in by somebody
called David Waters.

01:18:31.164 --> 01:18:33.004
David Waters?

01:18:33.083 --> 01:18:35.463
Danny said these people they took...

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:37.634
were expecting to come out of it alive.

01:18:38.922 --> 01:18:40.802
But he wasn't so sure.

01:18:40.883 --> 01:18:43.263
And you told all this to the police?

01:18:43.344 --> 01:18:44.474
Sure.

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:48.433
Yeah, but they didn't seem too keen
on looking for a missing ex-con.

01:18:48.516 --> 01:18:50.596
I called Waters up looking for Danny.

01:18:51.519 --> 01:18:53.229
He made up some excuse.

01:18:54.146 --> 01:18:55.936
And then he threatened to kill my family.

01:19:00.861 --> 01:19:02.951
Are you prepared to go on the record?

01:19:07.159 --> 01:19:08.159
Yeah.

01:19:23.592 --> 01:19:26.182
[woman] <i>Mr. Waters,</i>
<i>I'm not one for plea agreements,</i>

01:19:26.262 --> 01:19:28.562
<i>but I don't really have a say
in the matter.</i>

01:19:28.639 --> 01:19:30.519
<i>You've discussed this with your lawyer?</i>

01:19:36.021 --> 01:19:37.061
Go ahead.

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:41.778
Gary was like a mad dog.

01:19:43.279 --> 01:19:45.449
<i>Sooner or later he was gonna bite.</i>

01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:47.071
[thud]

01:19:48.409 --> 01:19:49.739
[loud thud]

01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:55.790
David.

01:20:01.964 --> 01:20:03.174
[door opens]

01:20:03.256 --> 01:20:05.216
[Gary breathing heavily]

01:20:06.635 --> 01:20:08.345
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:20:08.429 --> 01:20:09.429
Oh...

01:20:10.348 --> 01:20:11.348
[Danny stammers] Oh...

01:20:11.432 --> 01:20:14.182
God damn it, Karr.
What the fuck did you do?

01:20:15.561 --> 01:20:17.021
[Danny] Jesus! David?

01:20:18.481 --> 01:20:19.821
What are we gonna do now?

01:20:19.898 --> 01:20:22.028
- [softly] Calm down.
- [Danny breathing heavily]

01:20:22.109 --> 01:20:23.939
I knew something like this
was gonna happen.

01:20:24.027 --> 01:20:26.657
We gotta get her body into the bedroom
so they don't see her.

01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:29.657
Oh, no.

01:20:31.535 --> 01:20:33.115
[sobbing] No! David, no!

01:20:33.203 --> 01:20:35.123
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:20:35.205 --> 01:20:36.825
[straining]

01:20:39.377 --> 01:20:41.627
Danny, do something!

01:20:43.589 --> 01:20:45.169
Mother!

01:20:48.636 --> 01:20:49.796
No!

01:20:51.764 --> 01:20:52.974
[grunts]

01:20:57.436 --> 01:21:00.896
- No!
- Don't look! Don't look!

01:21:00.981 --> 01:21:02.361
[straining]

01:21:08.989 --> 01:21:10.369
[sobbing]

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.930
[sobbing continues]

01:21:42.773 --> 01:21:44.613
[sobbing] Oh, God!

01:22:06.004 --> 01:22:07.304
Do it.

01:22:14.805 --> 01:22:16.095
[panting]

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:20.350
- [grunts]
- [gasping]

01:22:36.452 --> 01:22:37.452
Here.

01:22:41.331 --> 01:22:42.371
Do it.

01:22:53.969 --> 01:22:55.009
Do it.

01:22:55.929 --> 01:22:56.929
[sniffling]

01:23:01.268 --> 01:23:02.768
Gary, I can't.

01:23:03.854 --> 01:23:05.364
[sobbing]

01:23:07.733 --> 01:23:09.033
[sawing]

01:23:11.654 --> 01:23:13.614
[Danny sobbing]

01:23:21.914 --> 01:23:22.964
[Gary yells]

01:23:25.959 --> 01:23:29.419
[David] <i>He couldn't be trusted</i>
<i>to keep his mouth shut, so...</i>

01:23:29.505 --> 01:23:31.455
I had Gary take him out, too.

01:23:37.012 --> 01:23:39.062
[woman] What happened to the money?

01:23:40.974 --> 01:23:42.024
[scoffs]

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:45.730
[sighs]

01:23:51.109 --> 01:23:53.779
We kept the gold in a storage locker.

01:23:55.405 --> 01:23:58.155
And when we went to collect... [sighs]

01:23:58.241 --> 01:23:59.581
it was gone.

01:24:01.494 --> 01:24:02.874
We'd been robbed.

01:24:05.207 --> 01:24:06.997
Fucking five-dollar lock.

01:24:14.675 --> 01:24:16.505
I never intended to kill her.

01:24:19.512 --> 01:24:22.102
<i>But I can't say
that I'm sorry that she's dead.</i>

01:24:26.895 --> 01:24:28.805
[reporter] <i>We're live here at Camp Wood,</i>

<i>There were rumors that
they had fled to New Zealand...</i>

01:24:41.451 --> 01:24:43.751
Well, at least she didn't go unnoticed.

<i>Police finally narrowed in on Waters
and his partner in crime, Gary Karr...</i>

01:24:47.666 --> 01:24:49.416
She would've appreciated that.

01:24:49.501 --> 01:24:51.841
<i>Also charged with the murder

[lid clatters]

01:25:10.939 --> 01:25:13.529
Please, no prayers.
She wouldn't have wanted that.

01:25:32.377 --> 01:25:36.507
<i>Does it worry you that, uh, when you die,
that there's not going to be nirvana</i>

01:25:36.589 --> 01:25:38.429
<i>or whatever you care to call it?</i>

01:25:38.508 --> 01:25:41.218
[laughs] <i>When I die,</i>
<i>I don't want some religious nut</i>

<i>shoving a rosary up my ass
or communion wafer down my throat.</i>

01:25:45.641 --> 01:25:48.101
<i>But I wouldn't mind
a small corner of the outdoors</i>

01:25:48.185 --> 01:25:52.645
<i>where the sun can filter through the trees
and lay a gentle hand on my face.</i>

01:25:52.731 --> 01:25:55.401
<i>Three words on my tombstone.</i>

<i>"Woman."
I've loved being a woman.</i>

<i>"Grandmother."
I've loved being a grandmother.</i>

01:26:01.406 --> 01:26:04.576
<i>And "mother."
I have loved being a mother.</i>
