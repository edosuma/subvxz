WEBVTT

00:05.406 --> 00:07.006
(Panting anxiously)

00:10.444 --> 00:11.443
Thank god you're here.

00:11.445 --> 00:12.711
Okay. Okay.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.713
She shot her husband.
He's dead.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.115
All right, ma'am,
where's the shooter?

00:17.451 --> 00:18.450
(Gasping):
In the house, I think.

00:18.452 --> 00:20.052
Officer:
Okay, stay here.

00:20.054 --> 00:21.086
Listen to me,
stay here.

00:21.088 --> 00:22.488
Stay here, okay?

00:22.490 --> 00:24.089
We got a call
from the homeowner.

00:24.091 --> 00:25.157
She locked herself
in the bathroom.

00:25.159 --> 00:26.625
Said a woman
shot her husband.

00:29.230 --> 00:30.629
All right. Stay with her.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.803
Police!

00:48.716 --> 00:50.315
Police!

00:50.317 --> 00:51.383
Woman:
I'm-I'm in here!

00:56.424 --> 00:58.123
Okay, open
the door slowly.

00:58.125 --> 00:59.191
Woman: Okay.

01:01.362 --> 01:02.795
(Whimpers, gasps)

01:04.131 --> 01:05.197
Easy.

01:06.801 --> 01:08.267
Right there.

01:10.838 --> 01:13.138
(Gasps)
She's still here?

01:13.140 --> 01:14.740
She shot my husband!

01:15.843 --> 01:17.643
She said<i> you</i> did it.

01:17.645 --> 01:19.311
(Exhaling)

01:21.615 --> 01:24.416
¶ ¶

01:53.848 --> 01:56.248
(phone ringing)

01:56.250 --> 01:57.316
What?

01:57.318 --> 01:58.784
What's the matter?

01:58.786 --> 02:01.320
Getting a call from myself.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.222
Hmm. Answer it.
See what you want.

02:04.391 --> 02:05.524
Hello?

02:06.627 --> 02:07.659
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:07.661 --> 02:08.660
I must have grabbed it by
mistake

02:08.662 --> 02:10.229
when I was on my way out.

02:10.231 --> 02:11.430
I'll bring it to you, okay?

02:11.432 --> 02:12.815
Great.

02:12.816 --> 02:14.199
Grabbed Delilah's
phone by mistake.

02:14.201 --> 02:15.534
This could be
a disaster.

02:15.536 --> 02:16.502
Well, think positive.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.570
You get to see who calls her.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.439
Yeah, but the problem is
she might see who calls me.

02:21.208 --> 02:22.574
You hiding something, Tim?

02:22.576 --> 02:25.377
Gotta go to the Pentagon.
Be right back.

02:27.448 --> 02:29.681
Look who I found
in the lobby.

02:29.683 --> 02:30.716
Hi, Mr. d.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.384
Eleanor.

02:32.386 --> 02:33.719
You look great.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.454
Thank you.

02:35.455 --> 02:37.188
Hey, dad. What are you doing
here so early?

02:37.191 --> 02:39.158
It's Tuesday.
Our standing lunch.

02:39.160 --> 02:41.426
Yeah. Lunch is
at 1:00 P.M.

02:41.428 --> 02:43.362
Oh, well, I didn't have
anything to do this morning,

02:43.364 --> 02:46.632
so I thought I'd come by early
and see if I can help you guys.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.300
(Chuckling):
Oh. Help?

02:49.303 --> 02:50.636
I need a project.

02:50.638 --> 02:55.274
I got a friend of mine in
New York, uh, cubby kirschner.

02:55.276 --> 02:57.059
You remember him?

02:57.060 --> 02:58.843
Uh-huh. That doorman
at 86th street.

02:58.846 --> 02:59.845
Yeah, right.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.613
He retired.

03:01.615 --> 03:04.816
And, uh, now he's a volunteer
for the 20th precinct.

03:04.818 --> 03:06.585
He mans the desk in the lobby,

03:06.587 --> 03:09.388
takes calls,
does filing.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.423
I thought maybe I could do
something like that around here.

03:11.425 --> 03:12.958
(Chuckling):
Oh, you did, huh?

03:12.960 --> 03:14.927
Well, how about that.

03:14.929 --> 03:16.562
Not really
the same thing though,

03:16.564 --> 03:17.563
'cause this isn't
a police department.

03:17.565 --> 03:18.864
This is a federal agency.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.832
There's a lot of
secret-- top-secret,

03:20.834 --> 03:22.501
classified stuff,
security clearances...

03:22.803 --> 03:24.303
Uh, Tim?

03:24.305 --> 03:25.404
What do you think?

03:26.607 --> 03:29.208
Um, I'm not sure,
Mr. DiNozzo, but I gotta go.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.243
Hold on, McGee.

03:31.245 --> 03:33.212
We got a body at pax river.

03:33.214 --> 03:34.279
Let's go.

03:36.617 --> 03:37.849
Chief, you want a project?

03:37.851 --> 03:39.484
Yeah.

03:39.486 --> 03:41.453
I could use some help
tonight, in my basement.

03:41.455 --> 03:42.654
Got a job.

03:42.656 --> 03:43.722
Two-man job on a boat.

03:43.724 --> 03:44.723
I'll be there.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.291
I'll walk you out.

03:46.293 --> 03:48.227
Listen, we got to talk,
so if I get back in time

03:48.229 --> 03:50.662
we'll still meet
for lunch, all right?

03:50.664 --> 03:52.664
Okay, junior.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.233
Officer:
We've had a little trouble

03:54.235 --> 03:56.368
keeping them from scratching
each other's eyes out.

03:56.370 --> 03:57.569
Who are they?

03:57.571 --> 03:59.605
That's the victim's wife.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.740
We found her locked in the
bathroom when we got here,

04:01.742 --> 04:02.874
afraid the other one
was gonna kill her.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.443
Who is that?

04:04.445 --> 04:06.812
That is, uh...

04:06.814 --> 04:09.681
A very, close personal
friend of Jennings.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.650
Mistress?

04:11.652 --> 04:13.268
Well, I'm guessing.

04:13.269 --> 04:14.885
But, uh, we found her
out here on the front lawn.

04:14.888 --> 04:17.823
The crazy thing is,
that, uh...

04:17.825 --> 04:21.360
They both claim they saw the
other one do the shooting.

04:23.264 --> 04:27.499
(Camera shutter clicking)

04:33.807 --> 04:34.840
DiNozzo. Bishop.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.842
Test both those
women for gsr.

04:36.844 --> 04:37.909
Both: All right.

04:40.014 --> 04:41.546
What do we got?

04:41.548 --> 04:42.914
McGee:
Plaster dust.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.683
And what looks like
a bullet hole up there.

04:44.685 --> 04:45.884
Let me get a ladder.

04:49.590 --> 04:53.392
Ducky: Time of death
is between 8:30 and 9:00.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.560
Which is consistent with
the calls the women made to 911

04:55.562 --> 04:56.628
and the security company.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.563
Yeah, there are
two gunshot wounds:

04:58.565 --> 05:01.033
One to the chest,
one to the head.

05:01.035 --> 05:03.368
But there are
no defensive wounds.

05:03.370 --> 05:05.070
I'd venture that he was sitting
in his chair,

05:05.072 --> 05:07.773
and he turned to
face his attacker.

05:07.775 --> 05:08.907
Me?! You're gonna test me?!

05:08.909 --> 05:10.509
I told you.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.577
She shot her husband
in cold blood!

05:12.579 --> 05:14.096
That is a lie!

05:14.097 --> 05:15.614
I loved Laurence.
I would never hurt him.

05:16.684 --> 05:17.849
Why did you
have to kill him?

05:18.986 --> 05:20.886
This is gonna
be a messy one.

05:29.396 --> 05:31.096
Operator: This is 911.
What is your emergency?

05:31.098 --> 05:32.030
Joann:
There's been a shooting.

05:32.032 --> 05:34.066
I think he's dead.

05:34.068 --> 05:35.067
Operator:
What's your location?

05:35.069 --> 05:37.002
That was joann allman.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.370
The mistress.

05:38.372 --> 05:40.706
Call came in
at 8:58 A.M.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.574
Security operator:
DC home security patrol.

05:42.576 --> 05:43.742
Is this an emergency?

05:43.744 --> 05:44.976
Angelina:
My husband's been shot!

05:44.978 --> 05:46.545
Security operator:
Who am I speaking to?

05:46.547 --> 05:50.082
That was Angelina Jennings,
the wife, at 8:59.

05:50.084 --> 05:51.817
Calls were made
30 seconds apart.

05:51.819 --> 05:53.919
What do we know
about the husband?

05:53.921 --> 05:56.388
Born and raised in
Springfield, Massachusetts.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.091
He worked for a couple of
newspapers in Manhattan

05:59.093 --> 06:02.527
before becoming a civilian
writer for Navy publications.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.597
Been at naval air station pax
river the last two-plus years.

06:05.599 --> 06:07.065
What's his access level?

06:07.067 --> 06:08.734
Lowest. "Confidential."

06:08.736 --> 06:11.002
The folder in his apartment
contained press releases.

06:11.004 --> 06:14.373
McGee: Married his high school
sweetheart, Angelina Giovanni.

06:14.375 --> 06:15.874
She's a certified
nursing assistant,

06:15.876 --> 06:16.942
but she's
currently unemployed.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.443
What about the
other woman?

06:18.445 --> 06:19.978
Oh, well,
joann allman.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.646
Hails from Baltimore,
my old beat.

06:21.648 --> 06:26.017
Graduated from the unaccredited
chesapeake school of law.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.419
Bounced around
a couple of firms,

06:27.421 --> 06:28.820
was practicing on her own,

06:28.822 --> 06:31.156
till she was suspended recently
for, and I quote,

06:31.158 --> 06:35.394
"a pervasive pattern of
professional misconduct."

06:35.396 --> 06:37.396
Talk to them.

06:37.398 --> 06:38.663
I'm gonna take the mistress.

06:38.665 --> 06:40.098
Something about her
seems guilty.

06:40.099 --> 06:41.532
Hmm. Don't you always
suspect the spouse?

06:41.535 --> 06:43.001
Usually, but...

06:43.003 --> 06:44.770
(Groans)

06:44.772 --> 06:47.072
Okay. I'll take the wife.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.174
I guess I'll follow up
on the murder weapon.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.612
I suspected for a while
my husband was cheating.

06:54.715 --> 06:57.149
And, three days ago,
i caught him in a lie.

06:57.151 --> 07:00.152
He tried to deny it.
(Chuckle)

07:00.154 --> 07:02.487
We got in a huge fight

07:02.489 --> 07:04.022
and I moved out.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.991
I've been staying in a motel.

07:05.993 --> 07:08.593
Laurence called me
a couple days ago.

07:08.595 --> 07:11.530
He told me he finally
told his wife about us.

07:11.532 --> 07:14.833
He had been
promising to do it.

07:14.835 --> 07:17.002
How'd she take it?

07:17.004 --> 07:18.103
What do you think?

07:18.105 --> 07:20.439
Tell me about this morning.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.509
I was at the gym.

07:25.512 --> 07:27.179
Laurence called me
around 7:00.

07:27.181 --> 07:29.114
He said...

07:29.116 --> 07:33.051
Angelina wasn't handling the
situation very well.

07:33.053 --> 07:36.188
She was making
violent threats.

07:36.190 --> 07:37.989
I told him when
i finish my work out,

07:37.991 --> 07:40.459
I would...
I would come by.

07:40.461 --> 07:42.861
Laurence called.

07:42.863 --> 07:43.962
Waking me up.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.163
What time?

07:45.165 --> 07:47.499
At 7:00, I think.

07:48.235 --> 07:51.136
He said he was really
sorry and he loved me.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.071
(Shuddering breath) And he was
gonna call that woman

07:53.073 --> 07:55.607
and tell her that it
was over between them.

07:56.743 --> 07:59.211
When I got to the house,
she was already there.

07:59.213 --> 08:01.613
As I was walking up
to the front door...

08:01.615 --> 08:04.115
I heard shouting.

08:04.117 --> 08:06.151
When I went inside,
i found Angelina

08:06.153 --> 08:08.053
holding a gun
on Laurence,

08:08.055 --> 08:10.522
and I begged her
to put it down...

08:12.125 --> 08:14.092
...but she shot him.

08:14.094 --> 08:16.495
And she moved
closer and...

08:16.497 --> 08:18.897
She fired again.

08:18.899 --> 08:21.066
Then she turned the gun on me.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.133
She was out of her mind.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.669
She was screaming
at Laurence.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.388
If she couldn't
have him,

08:26.389 --> 08:28.106
then she wasn't gonna
let him come home to me.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.209
She pulled the trigger.

08:33.547 --> 08:35.247
T-twice I think and, um...

08:35.249 --> 08:38.116
Then she started
in my direction and...

08:38.118 --> 08:40.218
...and i-i was just
trying to defend myself.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.753
She was gonna shoot me,

08:43.090 --> 08:44.756
so I grabbed her arm and...

08:44.758 --> 08:46.258
We struggled.

08:46.260 --> 08:47.993
And the gun went off.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.227
How'd you get away?

08:49.229 --> 08:50.729
I don't know,
it was such a blur.

08:50.731 --> 08:53.198
The gun dropped to the floor
and i-i don't know,

08:53.200 --> 08:55.901
somehow I got outside.

08:55.902 --> 08:58.603
I locked myself in the bathroom
and i-i speed-dialed...

08:58.605 --> 08:59.671
The alarm company.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.540
(Sighs)

09:01.542 --> 09:03.975
What happens next?

09:03.977 --> 09:05.644
We're just starting
our investigation.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.078
We have a lot
of work to do.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.681
Well, um... can I,
can I go home?

09:09.683 --> 09:11.082
Uh, no, not to your house.

09:11.084 --> 09:13.051
It's still a crime scene.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.252
We're gonna keep you here

09:14.254 --> 09:16.288
while we finish
processing the evidence.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.758
Should I be hiring a lawyer?

09:19.760 --> 09:22.093
I need to make a call.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.645
Yeah, you do,

09:23.646 --> 09:25.196
because of course you can't
represent yourself,

09:25.198 --> 09:27.832
'cause your
license is suspended.

09:29.336 --> 09:32.971
The shot to Jennings' chest
was devastating.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.573
It tore through his aorta

09:34.575 --> 09:37.642
and lodged between the
t-4 and t-5 vertebrae,

09:37.644 --> 09:40.011
severing his spinal cord.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.980
But that was not enough

09:41.982 --> 09:43.848
for the shooter.

09:43.850 --> 09:46.151
She moved in for
the head shot.

09:46.153 --> 09:48.920
Yes. There was soot
around this wound,

09:48.922 --> 09:52.090
indicating that it was
fired at very close range.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.794
This wound to the chest
had no such residue.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.662
Anything else?

09:57.664 --> 10:00.699
Yes. We found fibers

10:00.701 --> 10:03.368
in the clotted blood
around this wound.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.705
Mr. Palmer's taking
them up to to Abby

10:06.707 --> 10:07.872
along with the slugs.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.643
Does that famous gut
of yours have an opinion?

10:11.645 --> 10:14.746
Scorned wife
or jilted lover?

10:14.748 --> 10:16.982
Ah, it's too early, duck.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.218
My gut's overrated.

10:22.322 --> 10:25.190
Don't you believe
that for a moment.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.394
Jennings' blood work
looks pretty normal,

10:29.396 --> 10:32.097
except his cholesterol's
a little high.

10:32.099 --> 10:34.099
Were you able to identify
the fuzzy little fiber?
Polyester.

10:35.068 --> 10:36.267
Any more specific?
Can you narrow it down?

10:36.269 --> 10:38.203
I will get to it, Jimmy.

10:38.705 --> 10:39.704
Sorry.

10:39.706 --> 10:41.306
So far this morning,

10:41.308 --> 10:44.409
I have run ballistics
on the slugs,

10:44.411 --> 10:46.111
fingerprints on
the murder weapon,

10:46.113 --> 10:50.015
gsr on the
suspect's hands,

10:50.017 --> 10:53.118
and blood tests
from the autopsy, and now

10:53.120 --> 10:54.853
I'm going through
every single file

10:54.855 --> 10:56.354
on the victim's
computer, and...

10:57.257 --> 10:59.224
I'm only one person.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.126
You're right.

11:01.128 --> 11:02.127
I'm sorry.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.863
I'm leaving.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.898
(Whispers):
Be careful.
I heard that .

11:08.168 --> 11:09.334
What do you want?

11:10.370 --> 11:12.270
Nothing. I just wanted
to tell you that

11:12.272 --> 11:14.039
the gun was
registered to Jennings.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.007
Thank you.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.108
Bought it six years ago.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.977
Gun shop in New York.
It's legal.

11:18.979 --> 11:20.111
Makes sense.

11:20.113 --> 11:22.213
His fingerprints
were on the gun, but

11:22.215 --> 11:25.316
so were both women's.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.319
I really enjoy
our lunches, junior,

11:28.321 --> 11:30.155
but you shouldn't
always pay.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.090
Dad, I have a job,
you don't.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.725
Don't remind me.

11:33.726 --> 11:35.359
Retirement isn't all
it's cracked up to be.

11:35.362 --> 11:38.263
I was hoping I could
help out around the office.

11:38.265 --> 11:39.264
Listen...

11:39.266 --> 11:40.899
I'm sure you'll
find something.

11:40.901 --> 11:43.268
It doesn't have
to be work.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.170
What about that flyer we saw
in the lobby of your building.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.906
Something about water aerobics
at the senior center?

11:47.908 --> 11:49.040
You promised
you'd try that.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.442
Oh, I did.

11:50.444 --> 11:52.043
How'd it go?

11:52.045 --> 11:53.211
I-i got a rash.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.746
Ugh. Where?

11:54.748 --> 11:56.247
My dermatologist said

11:56.249 --> 11:58.183
the chlorine was
damaging my complexion.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.184
(Sighs)
Look, there's...

12:01.021 --> 12:02.654
Excuse me.

12:02.655 --> 12:04.288
Dad, I've been looking
all over for you.

12:05.826 --> 12:08.226
Oh. Do I have a sister
i don't know about?

12:08.228 --> 12:10.161
Don't joke, junior.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.030
There's obviously
something wrong with her.

12:12.032 --> 12:13.431
You've mistaken me
for someone else.

12:13.433 --> 12:16.034
There's so much
i have to tell you.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.035
Here you go.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.169
Here's a little,
uh, something.

12:18.171 --> 12:20.171
Get... get yourself
something to eat.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.373
Dad...

12:24.277 --> 12:26.778
...please don't leave me.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.047
Come on.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.220
Thought I'd check in
before I go home.

12:35.222 --> 12:38.256
Which of the two women did you
decide to charge for the murder?

12:38.258 --> 12:39.958
Oh, we don't know yet.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.359
State's attorney's
office called.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.895
Wants an update. I told him
you had an eyewitness.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.430
We got two.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.132
They're accusing each other.

12:47.134 --> 12:48.266
That's interesting.

12:49.169 --> 12:50.502
Either one better for it?

12:50.504 --> 12:53.204
Well, Leon, we have
varying opinions.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.172
I think the mistress.

12:54.174 --> 12:55.240
I think the wife.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.541
I'm somewhere
in the middle.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.810
The wife says
she was at a motel

12:58.812 --> 13:01.780
before the murder and the
mistress said she was at a gym.

13:01.782 --> 13:04.315
Cell phone tower logs
confirm both stories are true.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.117
The mistress is
a suspended lawyer

13:06.119 --> 13:08.086
who practiced
on the edges of the law.

13:08.088 --> 13:09.487
Neighbors told me

13:09.489 --> 13:11.956
the wife was
constantly attacking

13:11.957 --> 13:14.424
and berating her husband, who
they say was the nicest guy.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.995
Nicest guy who
cheats on his wife.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.897
What about gsr tests?

13:18.899 --> 13:20.298
Well, both of them had
gun residue on their hands,

13:20.300 --> 13:22.433
but they both said they
struggled for the gun.

13:22.435 --> 13:25.236
So, you see
where we are?

13:25.238 --> 13:27.806
Sounds like either one
of them could be guilty...

13:27.808 --> 13:29.908
Or innocent.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.477
A little higher, chief.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.445
Pressure it.

13:34.447 --> 13:35.847
Ah, right there.
Got it.

13:40.287 --> 13:41.553
Okay.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.155
Good.

13:44.157 --> 13:47.125
So, is DC
working out for you?

13:47.127 --> 13:49.861
Oh, I've had to
make some adjustments.

13:49.863 --> 13:53.231
But it's been so good for me
living close to junior.

13:54.467 --> 13:57.302
It's been good
for him, too.

13:57.304 --> 13:59.838
He sure looks forward
to your Tuesday lunches.

14:01.575 --> 14:03.942
The strangest thing
happened this afternoon.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.510
When we came out
of the restaurant,

14:05.512 --> 14:08.446
this, uh, homeless woman
came up and grabbed me.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.315
She thought I was
her father.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.251
There's a lot of homeless
people, chief,

14:13.253 --> 14:15.019
who suffer from
mental problems.

14:15.021 --> 14:18.323
Yeah, well, what
bothers me is...

14:18.325 --> 14:19.858
She wasn't that old.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.594
It's so sad.

14:22.596 --> 14:25.563
I<i> could</i> have
a daughter her age.

14:26.633 --> 14:29.534
There was something
in her eyes, Gibbs.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.336
I don't know why,
but I'm feeling guilty

14:31.338 --> 14:33.471
that I just turned
and walked away.

14:34.875 --> 14:37.275
She appeared so lost.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.481
Well, you said you were
looking for a project.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.350
Yeah.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.153
Go find her.

14:49.155 --> 14:50.221
(Scoffs)

14:50.223 --> 14:51.589
You serious?

14:51.591 --> 14:54.592
You got something
better to do?

15:17.284 --> 15:18.917
Hold your horses.

15:20.654 --> 15:23.121
Oh, thank god
you haven't left yet.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.589
We need your help.

15:24.591 --> 15:25.657
We?

15:25.659 --> 15:27.091
Yeah.

15:29.663 --> 15:30.929
Hi.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.264
What is she doing here?

15:33.266 --> 15:35.967
She has a name.

15:35.969 --> 15:37.201
Susan.

15:37.203 --> 15:38.937
She needs our help.

15:39.606 --> 15:40.672
Watch your step.

15:40.674 --> 15:41.940
Careful.

15:42.976 --> 15:45.043
Susan,
this is Tony.

15:45.045 --> 15:46.477
You saw him
yesterday.

15:46.479 --> 15:47.545
This is his apartment.

15:47.547 --> 15:48.680
Oh.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.717
It's very nice.

15:52.719 --> 15:55.253
Thank you, Susan.

15:55.255 --> 15:56.387
Mmm!

15:56.656 --> 15:58.456
Huh.

15:58.457 --> 16:00.257
Is there a reason
you brought her here?

16:00.260 --> 16:02.961
Oh, she's so confused.

16:02.963 --> 16:04.562
She can't remember
her last name.

16:04.564 --> 16:07.398
Maybe she has family
who can help her.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.167
I still don't
understand, dad.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.002
You're a federal agent.

16:11.004 --> 16:13.137
You find out
things about people.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.706
(Susan playing
simple melody on piano)

16:22.515 --> 16:24.415
Susan...

16:24.417 --> 16:25.717
That's beautiful.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.288
You play piano.

16:30.290 --> 16:33.324
You're the one who
made me take lessons.

16:39.132 --> 16:41.599
She still thinks
that I'm her father.

16:41.601 --> 16:43.668
(Chuckling): Oh, yeah.
I got that.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.036
Okay.

16:45.038 --> 16:46.671
This is crazy.

16:46.673 --> 16:49.240
You can't do this.
You can't just bring

16:49.242 --> 16:50.375
a homeless person

16:50.377 --> 16:52.176
into my apartment.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.344
Is something burning?

16:53.346 --> 16:54.612
(Both sniff)

16:54.614 --> 16:56.414
Oh! My bagel.

16:59.652 --> 17:00.718
(Groans)

17:02.555 --> 17:03.788
(Groans)

17:03.790 --> 17:05.256
Hot, hot, hot,
hot, hot, hot!

17:05.258 --> 17:06.624
(Crashing in distance)

17:06.626 --> 17:08.026
Dad?

17:11.564 --> 17:13.331
Sorry, sorry.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.700
I thought I could
find some I.D. In her stuff.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.468
What is that?

17:18.671 --> 17:20.238
My bird seed.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.373
Dad...

17:30.050 --> 17:31.416
Something wrong?

17:31.418 --> 17:33.551
Everything okay with
you and Delilah?

17:33.553 --> 17:35.686
Yeah.
Yeah, why?

17:35.688 --> 17:37.755
You seemed worried yesterday

17:37.757 --> 17:39.791
about her getting
your calls.

17:39.793 --> 17:42.393
Are you hiding
something from her?

17:50.737 --> 17:52.503
I kind of am. I'm...

17:52.505 --> 17:54.605
I'm expecting a call
from a jeweler.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.140
Been looking at
diamond rings.

17:56.142 --> 17:58.776
Tim... (Laughs)

17:58.778 --> 18:00.511
Hey, McGee.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.280
Hey, boss.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.248
Pulled Jennings'
bank records.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.117
He lived paycheck
to paycheck

18:06.119 --> 18:08.252
until last year,
when he deposited

18:08.254 --> 18:10.221
over $500,000 into
two separate accounts.

18:10.223 --> 18:11.355
Two different banks.

18:11.357 --> 18:12.356
Where's the money
come from?

18:12.358 --> 18:13.591
We're still
checking it out.

18:13.593 --> 18:14.792
And where did it go?

18:14.794 --> 18:16.427
Both accounts have
been depleted.

18:17.730 --> 18:20.331
Money is always
a good motive for murder.

18:21.367 --> 18:22.767
Nice of you
to show up, DiNozzo.

18:22.769 --> 18:26.838
Yes, well, I was in my own
personal hell this morning.

18:26.840 --> 18:28.439
My father showed up...

18:28.441 --> 18:30.741
At my apartment
with a woman.

18:30.743 --> 18:32.743
What, a socialite
this time?

18:32.745 --> 18:33.711
Heiress?

18:33.713 --> 18:35.346
Homeless.

18:35.348 --> 18:37.181
My father brought

18:37.183 --> 18:39.417
a straight-off-the-street
bag lady into my apartment.

18:39.419 --> 18:41.853
Rusty old shopping
cart and all.

18:41.855 --> 18:45.123
And dad said that it
was your idea, Gibbs?

18:45.859 --> 18:47.825
I'm glad he found her.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.260
She still at your place?

18:49.262 --> 18:50.294
No.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.330
I got dad the name
of a shelter

18:52.332 --> 18:55.133
and I put the both
of them into an uber.

19:02.275 --> 19:03.641
Nice shoes.

19:05.278 --> 19:06.277
Thanks.

19:06.279 --> 19:07.912
Size ten?

19:07.914 --> 19:09.680
Nine and a half.

19:09.682 --> 19:12.583
And I bet you got
a whole lot more at home.

19:12.585 --> 19:14.619
You really need those?

19:14.621 --> 19:15.853
Mr. DiNozzo.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.255
Dad.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.723
I was afraid you left.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.825
No, I told you I'd wait.

19:20.827 --> 19:21.893
(Quiet laugh)

19:21.895 --> 19:22.894
Susan.

19:22.896 --> 19:24.428
Take a seat.

19:24.430 --> 19:25.630
We'll be right back.

19:30.170 --> 19:32.603
We just provide shelter

19:32.605 --> 19:35.406
and food here
on a temporary basis.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.341
It's obvious Susan
needs medical attention.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.310
Oh, I agree.

19:39.312 --> 19:43.347
She, um, she seems
so weak... disoriented.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.616
We have a physician's assistant
who volunteers here.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.385
She's making rounds now.

19:47.387 --> 19:48.452
I'll have her
take a look at Susan.

19:48.454 --> 19:50.621
Oh, that'd be great.
Thanks.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.590
It would help if
we had her full name.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.859
We might get access
to her medical records.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.661
How do we get that?

19:56.663 --> 19:58.563
Well, if she gives us
permission,

19:58.564 --> 20:00.464
we can take her fingerprints
and have the police run them.

20:00.466 --> 20:04.235
But it usually takes weeks and
it's not a priority for them.

20:04.237 --> 20:06.504
Give me the prints.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.639
I've got connections.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.479
<i> (Knocking on door)</i>

20:15.481 --> 20:16.948
Gibbs:
Lieutenant Paul.

20:16.950 --> 20:18.816
Special agents Gibbs
and McGee.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.952
This is about
Laurence Jennings.

20:20.954 --> 20:22.954
I'm still in shock.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.955
I knew something was wrong
when he didn't come in
yesterday morning.

20:26.259 --> 20:28.459
So, this is
Jennings' office.

20:28.461 --> 20:29.660
Yeah.

20:29.662 --> 20:31.462
He was supposed to
put out an article

20:31.463 --> 20:33.263
on a new daycare center
opening up on the base.

20:33.266 --> 20:36.367
Started it at home but only
got halfway through, so...

20:36.369 --> 20:37.635
I gotta finish it.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.737
Good thing he
put it in the cloud.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.006
What can you
tell us about him?

20:42.008 --> 20:43.908
Nice guy.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.610
Did his job.
Very competent.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.845
Did he ever have
any problems with anyone?

20:47.847 --> 20:50.615
No, not here.
He was really well liked.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.717
What about at home?

20:52.719 --> 20:55.036
Yeah...

20:55.037 --> 20:57.354
Thought that might get resolved
when he hit it big but...

20:57.357 --> 20:58.789
How's that?

20:58.791 --> 21:01.692
He had five numbers
in the lottery last year.

21:01.694 --> 21:04.328
Took home almost a half
a million bucks, after taxes.

21:06.733 --> 21:08.299
How many people
he tell about that?

21:08.301 --> 21:09.484
Not many.

21:09.485 --> 21:10.668
Maryland's one of
the few states

21:10.670 --> 21:12.036
that allows winners
to remain anonymous.

21:12.038 --> 21:13.771
That's why he got
involved with the lawyer.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.506
Joann allman.

21:15.508 --> 21:19.010
Yeah. You win that much money,
you need advice.

21:19.012 --> 21:21.779
Kind of feel guilty. I was the
one that introduced him to her.

21:22.915 --> 21:24.615
Were they having an affair?

21:25.652 --> 21:27.685
That was the scuttlebutt.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.787
Abby:
I'm trying to identify a fiber

21:29.789 --> 21:32.323
I found on a victim.

21:32.325 --> 21:34.925
Right now, I'm doing a
microscopic examination

21:34.927 --> 21:37.728
of both the longitudal and
cross-sectional samples.

21:37.730 --> 21:38.729
And then, after that,

21:38.731 --> 21:40.431
I'll do a solubility test.

21:40.433 --> 21:41.599
Abby,

21:41.601 --> 21:43.468
you are adorable.

21:43.469 --> 21:45.336
Even though I don't understand
a word you're saying.

21:45.338 --> 21:48.005
Dad! I heard you were wandering
around the building.

21:48.007 --> 21:49.640
Senior:
Yeah, well, I, uh...

21:49.642 --> 21:53.077
I came here to ask my dear
friend Abby to do me a favor.

21:53.079 --> 21:54.612
What?

21:54.614 --> 21:56.631
Well, I, uh,

21:56.632 --> 21:58.649
I brought Susan to the shelter,
like you suggested.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.651
If we can find out
her last name,

22:00.653 --> 22:03.387
maybe we can access
her medical records.

22:03.389 --> 22:04.989
They took her fingerprints

22:04.991 --> 22:06.490
and I'm hoping that

22:06.492 --> 22:07.792
Abby can find a match.

22:09.329 --> 22:11.629
Dad, that's very
commendable, but...

22:11.631 --> 22:13.664
You can't ask Abby
to break agency rules

22:13.666 --> 22:15.733
for a personal favor.

22:15.735 --> 22:16.734
(Computer dings)

22:16.736 --> 22:17.735
We got a hit.

22:17.737 --> 22:18.636
You ran the prints.

22:18.638 --> 22:20.638
Of course I did, Tony.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.840
Poor homeless woman
in need of medical care?

22:22.842 --> 22:24.408
That's a no-brainer.

22:24.410 --> 22:25.409
(Typing on keyboard)

22:25.411 --> 22:26.677
She's in the iafis database.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.746
Huh. I guess that is her.

22:32.518 --> 22:36.387
Okay, her name is
Susan Elizabeth lowe.

22:36.389 --> 22:38.756
She was an army corporal,

22:38.758 --> 22:41.759
honorably discharged
in 1986.

22:41.761 --> 22:45.029
That means she's probably
eligible for va benefits.

22:45.031 --> 22:47.665
Oh, Abby, you're the best.

22:47.667 --> 22:48.632
Oh, thanks so much.

22:48.634 --> 22:50.101
Sorry, son.

22:50.103 --> 22:52.036
He's such a compassionate man.

22:52.038 --> 22:54.672
Who knew?

22:54.674 --> 22:56.807
Bishop:
We've done forensic accounting

22:56.809 --> 22:59.677
on Jennings' expenses
since he won the money.

22:59.679 --> 23:02.446
His wife
went on a spending spree.

23:02.448 --> 23:05.616
Started out with
household items and appliances,

23:05.618 --> 23:07.518
then she moved on to jewelry.

23:07.520 --> 23:08.719
Expensive jewelry.

23:08.721 --> 23:11.389
She became an
online shopping addict.

23:11.391 --> 23:13.591
The money ran out,
but Angelina didn't stop.

23:13.593 --> 23:17.695
She accumulated over
$40,000 in credit card debt.

23:17.697 --> 23:20.664
In a rage, Jennings cut up
her cards last week.

23:20.666 --> 23:22.433
That may all be true,
but I have evidence...

23:22.435 --> 23:23.734
Just as compelling.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.603
As previously stated,

23:25.605 --> 23:28.639
the proceeds from the lottery
were deposited in two accounts,

23:28.641 --> 23:29.607
in two separate banks.

23:29.609 --> 23:30.975
Exhibit b.

23:30.977 --> 23:33.611
Doctor's bills.

23:33.613 --> 23:35.546
We got your rhinoplasty,
we got your mammaplasty,

23:35.548 --> 23:37.114
we got your liposuction--
otherwise known as

23:37.116 --> 23:39.617
nose job, boob job, and where
they suck the fat out of you.

23:39.619 --> 23:41.786
Plus collagen, Botox--

23:41.788 --> 23:43.754
and you're asking yourself

23:43.756 --> 23:46.657
who is the lucky recipient of
all these wonderful procedures?

23:46.659 --> 23:49.193
Well, it was none other
than the mistress,

23:49.195 --> 23:50.694
joann allman, formerly esquire.

23:50.696 --> 23:52.630
Bishop:
What are you getting at?

23:52.632 --> 23:55.599
Why would a woman kill the man
who gave all that to her?

23:55.601 --> 23:57.802
To answer that question,
i bring to the witness stand

23:57.804 --> 23:59.203
Mr. Timothy McGee.

23:59.205 --> 24:00.771
Jennings cut her off, too.

24:00.773 --> 24:01.939
You're taking Tony's side?

24:01.941 --> 24:04.208
Afraid so.
(Sighs)

24:04.210 --> 24:05.810
Jennings was leasing
a brand-new Lexus

24:05.812 --> 24:07.678
for joann.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.213
Stopped making payments on it
two months ago.

24:09.215 --> 24:11.148
When they came to
repossess the car,

24:11.150 --> 24:12.750
Jennings started receiving
threatening texts.

24:12.752 --> 24:14.485
The wife<i> more </i>
than threatened.

24:14.487 --> 24:15.586
Two weeks ago,
the police were called

24:15.588 --> 24:17.054
to the Jennings' residence.

24:17.056 --> 24:19.123
Angelina was physically and
verbally attacking her husband

24:19.125 --> 24:20.892
on the front lawn.

24:20.893 --> 24:22.660
Jennings has a $2 million
life insurance policy,

24:22.662 --> 24:24.695
and his wife is
the sole beneficiary.

24:24.697 --> 24:26.597
Bishop:
Which proves my point.

24:26.599 --> 24:28.799
If the beneficiary is the
murderer, she can't collect.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.668
That's why she's
blaming the mistress.

24:30.669 --> 24:32.536
Okay, smarty-pants, how does
insurance benefit the mistress?

24:32.538 --> 24:34.472
I mean, she has no dog
in this fight.

24:34.474 --> 24:35.639
Gibbs:
Okay, I got it.

24:35.641 --> 24:37.708
They both have a motive.

24:37.709 --> 24:39.776
They both say they saw
the other do the killing.

24:39.779 --> 24:41.579
One of 'em is lyin'.

24:41.581 --> 24:42.780
Let's find out who.

24:43.749 --> 24:45.783
And how do you propose
we do that?

24:45.785 --> 24:48.752
Let's see who's willing
to take a polygraph.

24:58.965 --> 25:00.264
Hey.
Bishop brought in the wife.

25:00.266 --> 25:01.899
Just started
the polygraph.

25:01.901 --> 25:03.968
McGee is, uh,
bringing in the mistress.

25:03.970 --> 25:05.903
Your idea was a good one.

25:05.905 --> 25:07.088
Yeah, we'll see.

25:07.089 --> 25:08.272
Polygraphs aren't
always conclusive.

25:08.274 --> 25:10.508
No, I was talking
about my father.

25:10.510 --> 25:13.244
Your suggestion that
he help the homeless woman.

25:13.246 --> 25:16.247
He's really invigorated,
you know?

25:16.249 --> 25:17.515
He has a purpose.

25:17.517 --> 25:18.983
Acting like he's
20 years younger.

25:18.985 --> 25:20.251
Thank you.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.554
Just gave the chief a nudge.

25:24.891 --> 25:26.223
Hmm.

25:27.159 --> 25:29.176
Did you spend the night

25:29.177 --> 25:31.194
at the fremont inn
on three notch road?

25:32.532 --> 25:34.198
Angelina: Yes.

25:35.635 --> 25:36.867
I heard what
you were doing.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.302
I didn't want to miss it.

25:39.272 --> 25:41.089
Be my guest.

25:41.090 --> 25:42.907
Agent bale has finished
the baseline questions

25:42.909 --> 25:44.708
and is getting
down to business.

25:44.710 --> 25:46.644
Bale: When you
got to the house,

25:46.646 --> 25:48.178
did you confront
your husband?

25:49.181 --> 25:50.247
No.

25:51.250 --> 25:53.951
Bale:
Was joann allman there?

25:55.054 --> 25:56.186
Yes.

25:57.924 --> 25:59.890
Did you kill your husband?

26:02.261 --> 26:03.260
No.

26:03.262 --> 26:05.095
She seem nervous to you?

26:19.245 --> 26:20.811
Size ten.

26:20.813 --> 26:23.280
Harvey, great news.

26:23.282 --> 26:25.616
Susan's last name
is lowe.

26:25.618 --> 26:27.084
She's an army veteran,

26:27.086 --> 26:29.753
which means we can
get her into a va hospital.

26:29.755 --> 26:32.323
That's good, but
there's a problem.

26:32.325 --> 26:34.825
She's not here.
She left.

26:34.827 --> 26:37.445
What do you mean
she's not here?

26:37.446 --> 26:40.064
The physician's assistant gave
Susan a basic physical exam

26:40.066 --> 26:41.599
and wanted to
consult with a doctor.

26:41.601 --> 26:43.133
I think that
scared her.

26:43.135 --> 26:45.970
We asked her to wait out here
and she wandered off.

26:45.972 --> 26:47.338
How could you let that happen?

26:47.340 --> 26:48.339
Mr. DiNozzo...

26:48.341 --> 26:49.840
We are understaffed here

26:49.842 --> 26:52.710
and we have far more
people than we can handle.

26:52.712 --> 26:54.812
(Sighs quietly)

26:54.814 --> 26:58.015
Have a seat. Please.

27:00.219 --> 27:02.186
It's very apparent
that Susan

27:02.188 --> 27:04.822
is suffering from
some form of dementia.

27:04.824 --> 27:06.957
But the physician's assistant
noted some other symptoms

27:06.959 --> 27:08.993
that are
very disturbing.

27:08.995 --> 27:12.630
Uh, blurred vision, muscle
weakness, headaches, dizziness,

27:12.632 --> 27:14.999
balance problems,
and fatigue.

27:17.169 --> 27:18.669
What did she say it was?

27:18.671 --> 27:22.306
She suggested Susan
be brought to a hospital

27:22.308 --> 27:24.241
and tested for a brain tumor.

27:26.178 --> 27:28.245
Oh, my god.

27:30.816 --> 27:32.282
I got to find her.

27:33.653 --> 27:35.653
Were you involved in an
intimate relationship

27:35.655 --> 27:37.254
with Laurence Jennings?

27:37.256 --> 27:38.389
Yes.

27:38.391 --> 27:42.192
Bale: Did you leave the gym
and go to his house?

27:42.194 --> 27:44.361
Yes.

27:44.363 --> 27:47.297
Bale: Did you confront Jennings
when you got there?

27:47.299 --> 27:48.932
Joann: No.

27:50.302 --> 27:51.835
Did you kill Jennings?

27:53.239 --> 27:54.238
No.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.774
She sounds awfully self-assured.

28:00.813 --> 28:03.313
(Door slams)
Well, Ollie, what do you think?

28:04.383 --> 28:06.350
Well, not gonna make your life
any easier, director.

28:06.352 --> 28:10.187
Can't give either of them
a perfect score.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.289
But on the question,
"did you kill Jennings?"...

28:12.291 --> 28:13.757
Neither one of them
was lying.

28:16.062 --> 28:18.162
I'll go over
the data again.

28:18.164 --> 28:19.763
Thank you.

28:19.765 --> 28:21.365
Vance: Well...

28:21.367 --> 28:24.234
At this point, we can't
charge either woman.

28:24.236 --> 28:25.786
Whoever we brought to trial,

28:25.787 --> 28:27.337
their defense would be
that the other one did it.

28:27.339 --> 28:29.306
I agree with you.

28:29.308 --> 28:33.143
So much reasonable doubt,
a jury could never convict.

28:33.145 --> 28:35.245
Got to have more
conclusive evidence.

28:35.247 --> 28:38.348
(Speaking mandarin)

28:38.350 --> 28:39.783
Female voice:
I'm glad to meet you.

28:39.785 --> 28:40.818
(Repeats mandarin phrase)
(Tony laughs)

28:40.820 --> 28:42.419
(Doorbell rings)
Oh.

28:48.260 --> 28:49.460
Hey, did you find her?

28:49.462 --> 28:51.762
No.

28:51.764 --> 28:54.364
She wasn't where
i found her this morning.

28:54.366 --> 28:56.233
And, uh...

28:56.235 --> 28:58.802
I scoured
the neighborhood,

28:58.804 --> 29:01.238
I talked to people
on the street-- nothing.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.239
Have you had
anything to eat?

29:02.241 --> 29:03.240
No, I'm not hungry.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.209
Let me get
you something.

29:05.211 --> 29:07.311
(Sighs) Well...

29:07.313 --> 29:10.247
I got to say, I haven't seen you
this passionate about anything

29:10.249 --> 29:12.149
that wasn't work-related.

29:12.151 --> 29:14.752
That's a sad commentary.

29:14.754 --> 29:16.353
But you're not wrong.

29:17.823 --> 29:19.757
Woman really got
under your skin, huh?

29:19.759 --> 29:22.326
Yeah, yeah.

29:22.328 --> 29:25.829
Maybe because she
thinks I'm her father.

29:25.831 --> 29:27.297
Maybe because I'm
trying to make amends.

29:27.299 --> 29:30.901
I wasn't always there
for my only child.

29:30.903 --> 29:32.269
Dad?

29:32.271 --> 29:35.072
If you're lucky enough
to be a father,

29:35.074 --> 29:36.807
and I hope you are,

29:36.809 --> 29:38.342
you'll understand--
uh, may I?

29:38.344 --> 29:39.409
Of course.

29:43.783 --> 29:45.182
Well...

29:45.184 --> 29:48.385
Maybe it just feels good
to help someone.

29:49.355 --> 29:50.821
I can't help her

29:50.823 --> 29:52.823
if I can't find her.

29:52.825 --> 29:55.058
Oh.

29:55.060 --> 29:57.361
Well, after you left
Abby's lab,

29:57.363 --> 30:00.164
I could see how much
this meant to you,

30:00.166 --> 30:01.932
so, uh, I wasn't
going to tell you

30:01.934 --> 30:04.201
till I knew more, but i
did some research on Susan.

30:04.203 --> 30:06.236
Yeah?

30:06.238 --> 30:08.238
I guess she got to me, too.

30:09.575 --> 30:12.176
Susan lowe,
born Wichita, Kansas.

30:12.178 --> 30:15.379
Mother died when she was 12,
father died 15 years later.

30:15.381 --> 30:17.147
Any brothers or sisters?

30:17.149 --> 30:19.183
No, but she moved
to the DC area

30:19.185 --> 30:21.351
after her discharge
from the army.

30:22.388 --> 30:23.587
What did she do?

30:23.589 --> 30:25.422
I couldn't find much.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.524
A couple of jobs
here and there.

30:27.526 --> 30:31.428
But I did get her last known
address from a driver's license.

30:32.298 --> 30:34.998
Expired five years ago.

30:36.402 --> 30:37.467
(Chuckles softly)

30:38.504 --> 30:40.571
What happened?

30:40.573 --> 30:43.073
She was so pretty.

30:43.075 --> 30:44.341
So, dad...

30:44.343 --> 30:46.210
What we're gonna do is,

30:46.212 --> 30:48.078
tomorrow morning, you and I

30:48.080 --> 30:49.546
are gonna go
to that address,

30:49.548 --> 30:51.215
we're gonna ask around,
and hopefully,

30:51.217 --> 30:53.917
we can find
someone who knew her.

30:53.919 --> 30:56.486
Oh, well, thanks, junior.

30:58.324 --> 30:59.990
I really appreciate it.

31:00.893 --> 31:04.094
Well, good morning
to you, too.

31:04.096 --> 31:05.629
Is that your second
already this morning?

31:05.631 --> 31:08.632
It's my third, and
i don't need you to lecture me

31:08.634 --> 31:10.200
on the evils
of caffeine.

31:10.202 --> 31:12.135
Gibbs: Hope you two
got something.

31:12.137 --> 31:14.438
Yeah. I traced the fiber
found on Jennings' body

31:14.440 --> 31:17.374
to a textile mill in
guangdong, China.

31:17.376 --> 31:18.275
It's, uh, unique.

31:18.277 --> 31:19.943
Eco-friendly. That's good.

31:19.945 --> 31:21.545
Polyester used
exclusively for...

31:22.581 --> 31:24.481
...electric blankets.

31:24.482 --> 31:26.382
Yeah, placing the electric
blanket over the body,

31:26.385 --> 31:29.653
even for a short space of time,
would alter my calculations

31:29.655 --> 31:31.288
of the time of death.

31:31.290 --> 31:33.323
So, it's march.
It's still cold at night.

31:33.325 --> 31:34.258
What's missing
from this picture,

31:34.260 --> 31:36.159
from the
crime scene?

31:36.161 --> 31:38.328
Blanket.
Exactly.

31:38.330 --> 31:40.664
Warming the body would make
the death appear later,

31:40.666 --> 31:42.366
by as much as two hours.

31:42.368 --> 31:44.134
We know from
the cell calls that

31:44.136 --> 31:46.536
both of the women
were elsewhere earlier.

31:46.538 --> 31:48.005
Wife at the motel.

31:48.007 --> 31:50.941
Mistress at a gym.

31:50.943 --> 31:52.276
Neither could've
shot Jennings.

31:52.278 --> 31:55.412
Or could've been there
to see the other one do it.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.514
They both claim to have
witnessed the shooting,

31:57.516 --> 31:58.682
but they couldn't have.

31:58.684 --> 32:01.618
So, are these two women
who purportedly

32:01.620 --> 32:06.156
hate one another conspiring
to cover up the truth?

32:18.003 --> 32:20.270
Oh, this isn't
what I was expecting.

32:20.272 --> 32:23.040
This is a nice neighborhood.

32:23.042 --> 32:26.977
How did Susan go from
living in a place like this,

32:26.979 --> 32:28.345
to pushing a cart

32:28.347 --> 32:30.514
and looking for
a place to sleep?

32:31.483 --> 32:32.983
That's what we're
gonna find out.

32:32.985 --> 32:34.518
Tony:
Excuse me.

32:34.520 --> 32:35.652
You work here?

32:35.654 --> 32:37.521
Yeah, I'm the resident manager.

32:37.523 --> 32:39.556
Great. Uh, we're
looking for somebody

32:39.558 --> 32:41.425
who used to live here,
years ago.

32:41.427 --> 32:43.393
Her name is Susan lowe.

32:43.395 --> 32:45.395
Susan lowe?

32:45.397 --> 32:47.464
I haven't heard
her name in years.

32:47.466 --> 32:49.599
She used to live in the building
when I started working here.

32:49.601 --> 32:50.600
That's got to be...

32:50.602 --> 32:52.536
18, 19 years ago.

32:52.538 --> 32:54.538
You know her well?

32:54.539 --> 32:56.539
Yeah, we were friends.
Nice lady.

32:56.542 --> 32:58.976
After she moved out,
i lost contact with her.

32:58.978 --> 33:00.711
Why you asking?

33:00.713 --> 33:02.646
I'm a federal agent.

33:04.016 --> 33:06.316
Is, uh, Susan
in some kind of trouble?

33:06.318 --> 33:08.652
We met her
a few days ago.

33:08.654 --> 33:11.488
She's, uh, unfortunately,
suffering from dementia

33:11.490 --> 33:13.557
and living on the streets.

33:13.559 --> 33:15.993
Wow.

33:15.995 --> 33:17.060
That explains it.

33:17.062 --> 33:18.462
What do you mean?

33:18.464 --> 33:19.997
She went through
a difficult period.

33:19.999 --> 33:21.732
I just thought
she was depressed,

33:21.734 --> 33:24.067
but she was
acting really erratic.

33:24.069 --> 33:25.635
Why do you think that?

33:29.375 --> 33:31.008
Please.

33:31.010 --> 33:32.376
We're just trying
to help her.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.278
She was screwing up at work
and lost her job.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.446
After she couldn't
pay the rent,

33:36.448 --> 33:38.181
I carried her
for a couple of months.

33:38.183 --> 33:40.517
Till the owner
of the building found out.

33:41.453 --> 33:43.320
Where'd Susan go
after that, do you know?

33:43.322 --> 33:45.422
Uh, she told me
she was gonna

33:45.424 --> 33:47.424
try to reconnect
with her father.

33:47.426 --> 33:49.526
Uh, but that surprised me.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.628
Why do you say that?

33:51.630 --> 33:54.097
Well, they were
estranged.

33:54.099 --> 33:56.033
Never really got along
after the mother died.

33:56.035 --> 33:57.367
Susan left home at 18.

33:57.369 --> 33:59.569
I don't think
she ever saw him again.

33:59.571 --> 34:01.104
What was their problem?

34:01.106 --> 34:03.373
This was 30 years ago.

34:03.375 --> 34:06.276
Her father never
accepted she was gay.

34:06.278 --> 34:07.677
Where'd you see her?

34:07.679 --> 34:10.113
A restaurant near
lovejoy park.

34:10.115 --> 34:12.249
Yeah, that makes sense.

34:12.251 --> 34:14.284
She used to work
a block from there.

34:14.286 --> 34:16.787
She used loved to feed
the pigeons at lunchtime.

34:16.789 --> 34:18.655
I mean, I feel horrible.

34:18.657 --> 34:21.691
I-i... I thought Susan
just went back to Kansas.

34:21.693 --> 34:23.360
Bishop.

34:23.362 --> 34:25.062
You said Jennings had
a life insurance policy?

34:25.064 --> 34:26.296
Get a copy of it.

34:27.599 --> 34:28.799
That computer cloud thing

34:28.801 --> 34:29.833
you were talking about with
Jennings' boss

34:29.835 --> 34:30.801
how's it work?

34:30.803 --> 34:32.269
How exactly do you mean?

34:32.270 --> 34:33.736
Well, if you write something
on your computer,

34:33.739 --> 34:35.672
does it automatically
get stored someplace?

34:35.674 --> 34:38.608
Yes, and you can retrieve it
from that computer,

34:38.610 --> 34:40.277
or any computer,
or a tablet.

34:40.279 --> 34:42.546
Okay, and you delete
something on your computer,

34:42.548 --> 34:44.681
it automatically gets
removed from everywhere.

34:44.683 --> 34:46.416
No, not on most systems, no.

34:46.418 --> 34:47.784
All right.

34:47.786 --> 34:50.520
Find out if anything was deleted
from Jennings' laptop

34:50.522 --> 34:52.656
in the last few days, that's
still out there someplace.

34:52.658 --> 34:54.157
What are you thinking?

34:54.159 --> 34:56.359
I'll be in autopsy.

34:56.361 --> 34:59.362
Uh, what was
that all about?

34:59.364 --> 35:02.866
Tony: I guess you're parent
is always your parent.

35:02.868 --> 35:06.236
When Susan found out
her life was falling apart,

35:06.238 --> 35:09.139
she just wanted to be
reunited with her father.

35:09.141 --> 35:11.775
She didn't know
he was already dead.

35:11.777 --> 35:14.111
She probably
never found out.

35:14.113 --> 35:16.847
That's why she keeps
calling me "dad."

35:16.849 --> 35:20.417
In her mind, she's still
searching for him.

35:21.854 --> 35:26.490
You know, you and I had a few
years of non-communication,

35:26.492 --> 35:29.693
but, you know, I'm glad
that's behind us.

35:29.695 --> 35:31.394
Yeah, I second that.

35:35.134 --> 35:36.466
Susan...?

35:38.403 --> 35:39.736
Dad.

35:39.738 --> 35:42.305
Susan...

35:42.307 --> 35:44.141
Why did you leave?

35:44.743 --> 35:47.144
Because you don't like me.

35:59.258 --> 36:01.558
She's warm.

36:05.531 --> 36:06.897
She's on fire, Tony.

36:06.899 --> 36:08.798
I'll call an ambulance.

36:15.841 --> 36:18.241
Well, his hands were
free of gunshot residue,

36:18.243 --> 36:19.409
so I didn't think
there was any need

36:19.411 --> 36:20.544
to even look
under the nails.

36:20.546 --> 36:22.345
Get that tested
immediately, Mr. Palmer.

36:22.347 --> 36:26.316
And in future,
please complete all tests,

36:26.318 --> 36:29.419
whether<i> you</i> think
they're necessary or not.

36:29.421 --> 36:31.488
Hey, duck, is it hard to
remove gsr from the hands?

36:31.490 --> 36:32.923
Oh, no, it's quite easy.

36:32.925 --> 36:35.292
Scrubbing it with mild soap
and water will do it.

36:35.294 --> 36:36.826
Abby: So,

36:36.828 --> 36:39.329
how did you know there was
a document deleted

36:39.331 --> 36:41.431
off Jennings' laptop?

36:41.433 --> 36:42.699
A document was typed
on his home computer

36:42.701 --> 36:45.635
at 6:37 Tuesday morning,
deleted 8:51 A.M.

36:45.637 --> 36:47.237
But we retrieved it
from the cloud.

36:47.239 --> 36:48.572
Suicide note.

36:48.574 --> 36:51.508
And I repeat,
how did you know?

36:51.510 --> 36:53.810
It's not uncommon when
someone takes their own life.

36:53.812 --> 36:56.413
This note was addressed to
joann and Angelina.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.315
In a very vindictive language,

36:58.317 --> 37:00.350
Jennings accuses
both women of

37:00.352 --> 37:02.819
being greedy and draining
his life of any meaning.

37:02.821 --> 37:03.987
Wait, wait, wait,
i don't understand.

37:03.989 --> 37:05.755
If he committed suicide,

37:05.757 --> 37:07.791
how did he shoot
himself twice?

37:07.793 --> 37:10.293
Gunshot to the head
is self-inflicted.

37:12.331 --> 37:13.313
Gunshot to the chest...

37:13.314 --> 37:14.296
...is post-mortem by
one those two women.

37:14.299 --> 37:15.966
Make it look like a murder.

37:15.968 --> 37:18.401
Did you get a copy of
that insurance policy?

37:18.403 --> 37:20.303
Yeah, and it has the standard
"suicide clause."

37:20.305 --> 37:22.005
There's no payoff if the insured
takes his own life

37:22.007 --> 37:23.373
within two years.

37:23.375 --> 37:25.242
Abby: Okay, so...

37:25.244 --> 37:28.478
The wife wants to
cover up the suicide

37:28.480 --> 37:29.679
and make it look like a murder

37:29.681 --> 37:31.481
so she can collect
two million dollars.

37:31.483 --> 37:33.350
Why would the mistress

37:33.352 --> 37:36.853
go along with all this?

37:36.855 --> 37:38.688
Angelina: I said
I'd come with you.

37:38.690 --> 37:40.390
I've done
everything you asked.

37:40.392 --> 37:41.708
Now, can you please

37:41.709 --> 37:43.025
just tell me why
we're here?

37:43.028 --> 37:44.894
Asking the same question.

37:44.896 --> 37:47.030
What the hell
is she doing here?

37:47.032 --> 37:47.964
Haven't you arrested her yet?

37:47.966 --> 37:49.416
Me?!

37:49.417 --> 37:50.867
You're the one
that shot Laurence.

37:50.869 --> 37:51.968
Oh...

37:51.970 --> 37:54.371
Ladies, we know
what's going on here.

37:56.742 --> 37:58.041
You both claim that
Jennings called you

37:58.043 --> 38:00.610
from here on Tuesday
morning, and he did.

38:00.612 --> 38:03.313
Cell phone records and tower
logs confirm your stories.

38:04.383 --> 38:05.815
What's the problem?

38:05.817 --> 38:07.884
You both lied about
why he called.

38:07.886 --> 38:10.654
It was to tell you he was
going to take his own life.

38:10.656 --> 38:12.322
(Sighs)

38:12.324 --> 38:13.323
That's ridiculous.
Joann: Sure.

38:13.325 --> 38:14.324
He shot himself twice.

38:14.326 --> 38:16.926
We found his suicide note.

38:18.397 --> 38:19.562
You deleted it
off his laptop.

38:19.564 --> 38:20.730
But what you didn't know

38:20.732 --> 38:22.599
was that everything
on that computer...

38:22.601 --> 38:23.767
Is mirrored on the cloud.

38:23.769 --> 38:26.503
He was dead
before you got here.

38:26.505 --> 38:27.837
Self-inflicted gunshot
wound to the head.

38:27.839 --> 38:29.973
Bishop: Suicide.

38:29.975 --> 38:32.409
No way for you to collect
on his insurance policy

38:32.411 --> 38:34.377
and you couldn't fake
his murder on your own,

38:34.379 --> 38:35.645
because there was a witness.

38:35.647 --> 38:38.048
McGee: So you two
hatched your plan.

38:38.050 --> 38:40.784
Accuse each other,
create enough confusion

38:40.786 --> 38:42.652
and reasonable doubt
that, basically,

38:42.654 --> 38:44.654
no chance of either of you
being brought to trial.

38:44.656 --> 38:47.324
Sounds like something
a lawyer would do.

38:47.326 --> 38:48.491
Bishop: One of you

38:48.493 --> 38:50.860
shot the corpse
from across the room.

38:54.566 --> 38:56.666
But both of you had to have
gunshot residue on your hand,

38:56.668 --> 38:58.435
so one of you
shot the ceiling.

39:00.405 --> 39:03.540
Put a blanket over the body
to alter the time of death

39:03.542 --> 39:05.475
to coincide with
your 911 calls.

39:08.380 --> 39:10.013
Hey.

39:10.015 --> 39:12.949
How much of the
insurance money did she demand?

39:18.423 --> 39:19.489
Half.

39:20.459 --> 39:22.025
I can't believe you purposely

39:22.027 --> 39:23.993
let yourselves be
suspected of murder.

39:23.995 --> 39:25.528
Two million dollars.

39:26.998 --> 39:28.398
Not much of a downside.

39:28.400 --> 39:29.799
No, but we didn't--
we didn't kill him!

39:29.801 --> 39:31.801
Get them out of here.
(Sighs)

39:31.803 --> 39:33.436
Joann: What are we
being charged with?

39:33.438 --> 39:35.105
Bishop: Insurance fraud.

39:35.107 --> 39:36.539
I..
No, no, no.

39:42.881 --> 39:45.115
It's a glioblastoma
brain tumor.

39:45.117 --> 39:49.152
Which, in her case,
is inoperable.

39:49.154 --> 39:50.771
Can you do anything?

39:50.772 --> 39:52.389
Well, the tumor is
already past the stage

39:52.391 --> 39:54.924
where radiation
or chemotherapy can help.

39:54.926 --> 39:57.026
We'll just try and
keep her comfortable.

40:01.099 --> 40:03.166
How long does she have?

40:03.168 --> 40:05.802
Best case scenario
is a month.

40:05.804 --> 40:07.604
Probably less.

40:08.974 --> 40:11.007
You're aware,
Mr. DiNozzo, that...

40:11.009 --> 40:13.143
Susan thinks
you're her father.

40:33.198 --> 40:34.197
(Quiet laugh)

40:34.199 --> 40:36.032
You're still here.

40:37.869 --> 40:40.703
I couldn't leave
my daughter alone.

40:40.705 --> 40:42.672
(Gentle laugh)

40:42.674 --> 40:45.442
We have a lot of years
to make up for.

40:46.878 --> 40:49.946
We didn't separate
on such good terms.

40:51.650 --> 40:53.516
It was my fault.

40:53.518 --> 40:55.118
I was the one who ran away.

40:55.120 --> 40:58.087
No, no, no,
don't blame yourself.

40:58.089 --> 40:59.923
It was me.

41:00.826 --> 41:02.892
I, um...

41:02.894 --> 41:04.794
I was angry.

41:06.531 --> 41:08.064
My wife died.

41:10.235 --> 41:12.235
I had to raise
a child by myself.

41:13.805 --> 41:15.805
And I took it out on you.

41:17.242 --> 41:19.142
And I had no right to do that.

41:21.847 --> 41:23.146
I understand.

41:24.049 --> 41:25.782
Worse...

41:29.054 --> 41:32.055
I was intolerant
of who you are.

41:32.057 --> 41:34.557
I grew up in a generation

41:34.559 --> 41:37.694
where people didn't
accept everybody.

41:38.897 --> 41:41.531
And I've come
to realize that that...

41:44.135 --> 41:45.835
...that hurt me.

41:48.707 --> 41:50.206
I lost you...

41:52.043 --> 41:54.143
...my beautiful
little girl.

41:59.818 --> 42:00.917
And now...

42:03.722 --> 42:05.255
(Voice breaking):
...You're a beautiful woman.

42:12.163 --> 42:14.264
I love you, Susan.

42:16.268 --> 42:18.001
I love you, too.

42:29.781 --> 42:32.282
My beautiful
little daughter.
