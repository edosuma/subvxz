How do we know you're not lying?

13:33.313 --> 13:35.395
Oh, you don't. But I'm not.

13:35.899 --> 13:38.060
This is the best hope yet
we've had of an exit plan.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.311
And don't forget we're gonna need one.

13:39.403 --> 13:40.483
Then what are we waiting for?

13:42.489 --> 13:43.649
Emma.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.991
You were right. You need to
get that message to Henry.

13:48.078 --> 13:52.412
Every day without hope is a day closer
to becoming a Lost Boy.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.866
Your father and I should go.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.998
Hook's right.

13:59.089 --> 14:01.330
-Uh, you want to split up?
-|t's the last thing I want to do.

14:01.425 --> 14:03.711
But if there's a chance
he can get us home...

14:04.386 --> 14:06.342
-Okay.
-(SIGHS)

14:06.430 --> 14:08.421
-Emma, while I'm gone, just...
-Listen to my mother?

14:08.557 --> 14:10.172
(CHUCKLES)

14:10.267 --> 14:12.599
-Be careful.
-I always am.

14:13.228 --> 14:14.638
And when you send
that message to Henry,

14:14.730 --> 14:17.346
-add something to it for me, would you?
-Mmm-hmm.

14:17.441 --> 14:18.851
Tell him...

14:21.028 --> 14:23.110
Tell him Grandpa loves him.

14:25.115 --> 14:27.106
Oh. Um, okay.

14:28.869 --> 14:30.109
Good luck.

14:32.039 --> 14:33.119
You, too.

14:36.293 --> 14:37.703
-|s everything all right?
-Yeah.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.910
It's just... I've gotta go.

14:40.297 --> 14:41.912
Mmm. I'll see you soon.

14:42.799 --> 14:45.211
You know,
Neverland's a dangerous place.

14:45.302 --> 14:47.884
And, you know, you just never know
what's gonna happen.

14:47.971 --> 14:50.804
David. You're gonna be fine.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.135
Right.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.479
Mmm.

15:04.654 --> 15:05.734
I love you.

15:22.005 --> 15:23.120
(SNORTING)

15:41.691 --> 15:43.147
(BOY GRUNTING)

15:46.696 --> 15:48.197
What are you doing?

15:48.490 --> 15:50.902
Are you trying to start a war with Pan?

15:50.992 --> 15:52.823
Pan started the war
when he kidnapped my son.

15:53.995 --> 15:56.327
But that doesn't make you our enemy.

15:59.042 --> 16:00.031
What's that?

16:00.794 --> 16:03.957
Chocolate. I thought you might like
the taste of something sweet.

16:04.047 --> 16:05.378
EMMA: We don't want to hurt you.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.797
We just need you to
deliver a message to Henry.

16:07.884 --> 16:08.964
Why should I help you?

16:09.052 --> 16:10.258
Because you had
a home and family once,

16:10.345 --> 16:12.301
and you stopped believing
you could get back to them.

16:12.389 --> 16:15.222
Now we're here, we can help.
Notjust Henry, all of you.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.048
We can get you home.

16:22.858 --> 16:23.973
(SNIFFING)

16:24.067 --> 16:25.523
(CHUCKLES)

16:30.699 --> 16:32.064
Don't you get it?

16:32.159 --> 16:34.491
I'm here because
I don't want to go home.

16:34.578 --> 16:37.069
-None of us do.
-Pan is a monster.

16:37.581 --> 16:38.866
Look what he did to you.

16:38.957 --> 16:40.117
(CHUCKLES)

16:40.584 --> 16:42.415
Oh, Pan didn't do that.

16:43.420 --> 16:44.409
Henry did.

16:48.258 --> 16:49.748
KlLLlAN: How are you holding up, mate?

16:49.843 --> 16:52.585
Don't worry about me. Just worry
about getting us to the sextant.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.590
I meant the goodbyes.

16:54.931 --> 16:56.967
It looked a bit stormy back there.

16:57.058 --> 16:59.845
I did what had to be done,
and I did it out of love.

16:59.936 --> 17:02.598
Emma and Mary Margaret
will understand that.

17:02.939 --> 17:05.351
You're gonna tell them that
from beyond the grave?

17:05.442 --> 17:06.898
No. You are.

17:07.569 --> 17:10.026
You're gonna tell them that I died a hero
fighting for their way home.

17:10.113 --> 17:13.526
What you're not going to tell them
is that I left already a dead man.

17:13.617 --> 17:15.232
The truth, you mean.

17:15.410 --> 17:18.368
Their last memories of me
won't be of a liar.

17:19.456 --> 17:20.787
Why should I help you?

17:20.874 --> 17:22.114
(CHUCKLES)

17:22.209 --> 17:24.370
Well, because if you
didn't steal that bean,

17:24.461 --> 17:26.167
they wouldn't have had a chance
to take Henry.

17:26.254 --> 17:29.621
We wouldn't be on this island,
and I wouldn't be dying of Dreamshade.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.047
Fair point.

17:31.134 --> 17:34.376
At least you got to say goodbye.
Most people don't get that much.

17:36.932 --> 17:38.888
You lost someone, didn't you?

17:40.435 --> 17:41.971
This is where we ascend.

17:42.062 --> 17:44.474
I'll climb ahead
and throw down the rope.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.226
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

17:50.070 --> 17:51.560
It was your brother, right?

17:52.614 --> 17:55.481
I had a brother, too, you know. A twin.

17:57.619 --> 17:59.701
He died before I ever met him.

17:59.788 --> 18:03.246
There were two of you?
I can barely stomach one.

18:03.333 --> 18:06.075
Well, you would have liked him,
he was a thief and a liar.

18:06.169 --> 18:09.457
Yeah? You would've liked my brother.
He could be a stubborn ass.

18:10.006 --> 18:11.166
Now wait here.

18:29.693 --> 18:32.435
What exactly does the King
hope to find on this island?

18:42.163 --> 18:43.198
A plant?

18:44.124 --> 18:46.581
We journeyed across the realms
for a plant?

18:46.668 --> 18:50.536
Our sources say it's magical.
Potent enough to heal any injury.

18:50.964 --> 18:54.252
So we'd never have to
bury another sailor at sea again?

18:54.342 --> 18:56.128
Now you understand
the importance of our mission.

18:56.219 --> 18:57.880
PAN: Are you two lost?

19:00.015 --> 19:01.596
You look lost to me.

19:01.683 --> 19:03.139
Identify yourself, boy.

19:03.226 --> 19:06.684
I'm Peter Pan. I live here. Who are you?

19:07.314 --> 19:08.554
Captain Jones,

19:09.733 --> 19:11.314
and my lieutenant.

19:11.401 --> 19:13.562
We're here by order of the King.

19:13.987 --> 19:15.477
The King, huh?

19:16.364 --> 19:19.652
We don't have any kings in Neverland,
just me.

19:19.743 --> 19:20.858
That's funny.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.659
We seek this plant.

19:24.372 --> 19:26.328
Now tell us, boy, where can we find it?

19:26.416 --> 19:28.577
Your King sent you for this plant?

19:28.877 --> 19:30.868
-You know it?
-Dreamshade?

19:30.962 --> 19:32.623
It's the deadliest plant on the island.

19:33.757 --> 19:35.998
-Your King is really ruthless.
-Nonsense.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.707
-|t's medicine.
-|t's doom.

19:39.179 --> 19:40.635
Why fight a messy battle

19:40.722 --> 19:43.429
when you can kill an entire army
with the sap of one plant?

19:47.604 --> 19:51.768
(SOFTLY) Is it possible the King
would turn poison upon our enemies?

19:52.776 --> 19:54.767
Don't be so gullible.

19:55.904 --> 19:58.270
This boy is playing games with us.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.856
And I'm quickly tiring of them.

20:00.950 --> 20:02.531
Come. We should keep moving.

20:09.793 --> 20:12.125
Don't say I didn't warn you.

20:17.467 --> 20:19.628
(PANTING)

20:26.893 --> 20:28.303
PAN: Don't pull him up yet.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.971
I want to talk. Alone.

20:36.152 --> 20:38.143
-What do you want?
-To offer you a deal.

20:39.155 --> 20:41.737
Come back and work for me.
Like the old days.

20:43.076 --> 20:45.032
I don't miss the old days.

20:45.120 --> 20:48.658
What if I were to offer you something
very hard to come by?

20:49.499 --> 20:50.989
Passage off the island.

20:52.168 --> 20:53.749
Still not interested.

20:53.837 --> 20:55.873
What if I were to sweeten the deal?

20:55.964 --> 20:59.127
You can take someone with you. Emma.

20:59.634 --> 21:01.340
Emma would never leave her son.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.669
She did once before.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.425
And you can be there
to pick up the pieces.

21:07.183 --> 21:10.050
We've known each other
a very long time, Killian.

21:10.145 --> 21:12.136
We've done business before.

21:12.605 --> 21:15.938
And I think this is the perfect time
to restart that relationship.

21:16.025 --> 21:18.641
-What if I'm not interested?
-Of course you are.

21:19.154 --> 21:21.987
Because that's what
I've always liked about you.

21:24.189 --> 21:26.119
You're good at surviving.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.529
What do you want me to do?

21:27.620 --> 21:30.737
You'll be in my employ.
Do my dirty work.

21:30.832 --> 21:32.197
What dirty work?

21:32.292 --> 21:34.624
When the time comes, I'll let you know.

21:34.711 --> 21:37.703
But first, I need a signal
that you've taken my deal.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.789
So my word right now
wouldn't be good enough?

21:40.884 --> 21:42.215
You know me.

21:43.386 --> 21:45.047
I like action.

21:45.388 --> 21:46.798
I'll know you've taken my deal

21:46.890 --> 21:50.303
when I see the Prince's
dead body up on that peak.

21:51.060 --> 21:52.891
Well, you'll see that anyway.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.640
He's on his last legs,
thanks to Dreamshade.

21:55.857 --> 21:58.894
I want to see you kill him
before the poison.

21:59.527 --> 22:02.815
I want to see your hook inside his body.

22:05.533 --> 22:07.990
And what if I don't take your offer?

22:09.496 --> 22:12.704
Remember the last time
you didn't listen to me?

22:16.503 --> 22:19.995
Have a drink.
You know it always helps you think.

Apologies, mate.
It isn't much farther now.

23:03.383 --> 23:06.420
It certainly doesn't look like medicine.

23:06.511 --> 23:09.423
You choose to believe that boy
over our King?

23:09.764 --> 23:13.427
That boy showed us the path
to the Dreamshade.

23:13.518 --> 23:15.304
Why would he lie about its nature?

23:15.895 --> 23:17.556
To keep it all for himself.

23:17.647 --> 23:18.807
You actually think our King

23:18.898 --> 23:21.389
would send us to retrieve
something so dangerous?

23:21.484 --> 23:23.896
I would hope not.
This is not what I signed up for.

23:23.987 --> 23:25.352
You signed up to listen to your King.

23:25.446 --> 23:27.573
Because I thought
he was a man of honor.

23:27.657 --> 23:30.444
-He is.
-If this is a poison,

23:31.411 --> 23:35.404
it won't just end the war,
it will obliterate an entire race.

What do you know of any of this?

23:37.625 --> 23:39.911
I'm your brother and your captain.

23:40.003 --> 23:41.288
You will listen to me.

23:42.422 --> 23:43.662
No.

23:44.424 --> 23:46.836
I'll fight my enemies. But I'll fight fair.

Perfectly fine. I told you.

-Why?

25:08.257 --> 25:11.385
So I can rip his heart out.
Then he'll do exactly what we want.

This is not how we do things.

to get to Henry.

25:15.640 --> 25:18.848
Really? And what do you think, Emma?

25:23.690 --> 25:25.100
I think we need to talk to our son.

We can't do this. That is brutal.

It's Henry I'm worried about.

I know. That's why I'm willing to let

25:57.974 --> 25:59.555
When we finally get to him,

25:59.642 --> 26:01.257
ljust want to make sure
the line is still there.

Between what Regina is willing to do
and what you are.

41:26.652 --> 41:28.062
So I'll leave it up to you.

41:28.737 --> 41:30.523
To tell her or not.

41:34.034 --> 41:35.615
Let's see what kind of man
you really are.

41:56.139 --> 41:58.004
How's our guest?

41:58.100 --> 42:00.887
FELIX: We drugged him.
He'll be asleep for a while.

42:00.977 --> 42:02.683
Where do you want him?

42:02.771 --> 42:04.352
Hang him up.

42:04.773 --> 42:06.229
Over there.

42:08.360 --> 42:10.942
Next to the other one. (CHUCKLES)
