We were in second grade,

he wanted to be a doctor.

he, like, checked up on my --

to copy my homework.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.866
Yeah, no, you don't
want to let him do that.

00:33.868 --> 00:35.567
I'm pretty sure I do.

00:35.569 --> 00:38.237
No, sweetie,
he's using you.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.239

really like me, Mandy

I just said the same thing.

make some coffee.

a lot about coffee

Just so you would
come over here,

08:26.607 --> 08:28.940
Because you two enjoy
each other's company so much.

08:28.942 --> 08:31.643
What the what? Uh, no --
yeah.

08:31.645 --> 08:32.978
What? No.

08:32.980 --> 08:35.947
I-I go out of my way
to avoid him.

08:35.949 --> 08:38.517
Well, you suck at it.
I can see you.

08:40.052 --> 08:42.721
Geez, you two.
Get a room.

08:50.730 --> 08:52.063
Hey, Ed. You remember
rick wallace, right?

08:52.065 --> 08:53.131
Best man
at your wedding.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.299
Yeah, yeah.
Uh-huh. Yeah.

08:54.301 --> 08:55.534
One of my best friends.

08:55.536 --> 08:58.303
You wouldn't happen to have
his phone number, would you?

08:58.305 --> 08:59.971
I stopped
talking to that guy.

08:59.973 --> 09:03.074
He was always bragging
about his mediocre kid.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.076
Third place
in the swim meet.

09:05.078 --> 09:08.046
"yay, you lost.
You lost."

09:08.048 --> 09:09.915
Kind of lost touch with him.
He moved away.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.216
I guess
that's what happens.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.084
He moved back to denver
two years ago.

09:13.086 --> 09:16.855
He's been in the store.
Surprised he didn't say hi.

09:16.857 --> 09:19.524
Probably just,
you know, knows I'm busy.

09:19.526 --> 09:21.660
Probably didn't
want to bug me.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.728
That's why
he's a great friend.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.730
Hey, mr. Alzate?
Yeah.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.232
Uh, I was thinking about
that conversation

09:27.234 --> 09:28.400
You had with Ryan
yesterday.

09:28.402 --> 09:30.936
Mm-hmm.
So, uh, I made you this.

09:30.938 --> 09:32.604
A mix tape?

09:32.606 --> 09:34.606
Yeah,
a killer mix tape.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.575
Uh, "kiss from a rose,"
by seal,

09:36.577 --> 09:39.244
"every rose has its thorn,"
by miley c.,

09:39.246 --> 09:42.247
And, of course, "the rose,"
by the divine miss m.

09:43.182 --> 09:44.282
Guess what the theme is.

09:44.284 --> 09:46.952
"how to make another man
really uncomfortable."

09:48.955 --> 09:51.423
I don't know
what to do with this.

09:51.425 --> 09:53.291
Well, I thought
we could listen to it,

09:53.293 --> 09:55.360
You know, while we
talk about worldly stuff

09:55.362 --> 09:57.362
Like salty coffee
and roses.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.630
O-or kangaroos.

09:58.632 --> 10:01.433
I did a report on them
in the fourth grade, so...

10:01.435 --> 10:02.701
Some other time, Kyle.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.736
My daughter and I
have lunch plans.

10:04.738 --> 10:07.739
Actually, uh, gabriella called
and had to cancel, sir.

10:07.741 --> 10:11.076
So you're as free
as a kookaburra bird,

10:11.078 --> 10:15.146
A species indigenous
to australia, like the kangaroo.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.148
All right,
now who do I have lunch with?

10:20.586 --> 10:22.387
Ryan.

10:22.389 --> 10:23.922
Ryan, you hungry?

10:23.924 --> 10:24.956
Always.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.891
Good.
Let's have lunch.

10:26.893 --> 10:29.094
Huh? You're gonna love
this place.

10:29.096 --> 10:31.796
It has a candy cane rose bush
growing over the portico.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.131
Yeah, it's an amazing
restaurant.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.533
[ chuckles ]
except for the food.

10:39.405 --> 10:41.406
Hi. Whoa, whoa.
What's so funny? What's up?

10:41.408 --> 10:42.741
What?
Oh, no. Nothing.

10:42.743 --> 10:45.110
Um, Eve was just telling me
all about wyatt.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.445
Yep, I told him he couldn't
copy my homework,

10:47.447 --> 10:49.414
And he asked me
to hang out tonight.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.449
Yes! Exactly what I said
would happen.

10:51.451 --> 10:52.951
Exactly what Kristin said
would happen.

10:52.953 --> 10:53.952
But I said it first.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.487
Okay, Mandy,
you are sounding

10:55.489 --> 10:56.921
Really childish
right now.

10:56.923 --> 10:58.490
That's why I didn't
take her advice.

10:58.492 --> 10:59.691
But you did take it!

10:59.693 --> 11:01.259
Can't wait
to meet this guy.

11:01.261 --> 11:02.827
When's he coming
to pick you up?

11:02.829 --> 11:04.429
Oh, no. I'm meeting him and
a bunch of people at the mall.

11:04.431 --> 11:07.932
Oh, yeah. That sounds good.
Low-key, less pressure.

11:07.934 --> 11:10.702
[ inhales sharply ]
group date. Bag.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.004
Yeah,
see you later, wyatt.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.540
If he really liked you,
he'd ask you out solo.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.042
No, no, no.
Maybe he's just nervous

11:17.044 --> 11:18.843
And wants to have
his friends around, yeah.

11:18.845 --> 11:21.012
No. Guys go on group dates
to keep their options open.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.814
He's probably
gonna go sneak off

11:22.816 --> 11:24.115
And make out with sarah.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.283
How did you know
sarah was going?

11:25.285 --> 11:27.719
There's
always a sarah.

11:27.721 --> 11:29.120
Hey, I say go for it,
okay?

11:29.122 --> 11:30.622
You are just
being competitive

11:30.624 --> 11:32.524
Because she took my advice
and not yours.

11:32.526 --> 11:37.362
It was my advice!
We gave her the same advice!

11:37.364 --> 11:38.563
Hello, ladies.
Hey, dad.

11:38.565 --> 11:40.198
What are you doing
home from work?

11:40.200 --> 11:41.332
I forgot something.

11:41.334 --> 11:44.569
I forgot your boyfriend
works where I work.

11:44.571 --> 11:46.638
What are you
doing home?

11:46.640 --> 11:49.207
Well,
feeling real welcome.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.476
Where are you going?

11:51.478 --> 11:54.145
Well, contractually bound
roommate,

11:54.147 --> 11:55.146
I am going to have lunch

11:55.148 --> 11:56.648
With my good friend
carol larabee.

11:56.650 --> 11:58.483
It is something
that friends do.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.552
Well, if you become
best friends,

12:00.554 --> 12:02.554
You'll never
have to see her.

12:04.490 --> 12:05.990
Mike.

12:05.992 --> 12:10.495
[ scoffs ] somebody stole
carol's sign again.

12:10.497 --> 12:11.663
Well, we tried.

12:11.665 --> 12:13.832
No, hey.
Come here. Come on.

12:13.834 --> 12:14.833
What?

12:14.835 --> 12:16.067
[ scoffs ]

12:16.069 --> 12:18.036
How about I go to larabee's
and ask for another one?

12:18.038 --> 12:19.504
Yes. Yeah.
Yeah, of course.
God!

12:19.506 --> 12:20.505
You don't want
your best buddy

12:20.507 --> 12:21.740
To think you're the one
who took it.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.708
I couldn't give a rat's ass
what larabee thinks.

12:23.710 --> 12:24.843
You know, from now on,

12:24.845 --> 12:27.178
Let's leave the manger up
all year long.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.513
No one's gonna
pull this kind of crap

12:28.515 --> 12:30.582
In front of
a plastic jesus.

12:34.887 --> 12:37.622
[ doorbell rings ]

12:39.692 --> 12:41.059
Larabee.

12:41.061 --> 12:43.261
[ doorbell rings ]

12:57.610 --> 12:59.477
Need a hand with that,
Baxter?

13:08.087 --> 13:11.589
This is fun.
[ chuckles ]

13:11.591 --> 13:12.757
Yeah.

13:12.759 --> 13:13.758
Boy, it's been
a long time

13:13.760 --> 13:14.959
Since we've had lunch
together, huh?

13:14.961 --> 13:15.960
Mm-hmm.

13:15.962 --> 13:18.696
Have we ever
had lunch together?

13:20.666 --> 13:21.666
Haven't we?

13:21.668 --> 13:23.468
Never.

13:23.470 --> 13:26.304
Then it really has been
a long time.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.106
[ clears throat ]

13:28.108 --> 13:31.676
Boy, I really --
I love your earrings.

13:31.678 --> 13:34.746
Oh, chuck gave these to me
for our anniversary.

13:34.748 --> 13:36.080
Ah, Mike gave me a lecture

13:36.082 --> 13:38.349
On why anniversaries
are fascist.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.318
[ chuckles ]

13:40.320 --> 13:42.987
You know, uh, uh, let me --
let me ask you something.

13:42.989 --> 13:46.491
Um, do you and chuck
consider yourselves friends?

13:46.493 --> 13:49.594
Oh,
we're best friends.

13:49.596 --> 13:52.096
Great.
Oh, that's good. Great.

13:52.098 --> 13:54.165
Yeah, um,
you know, Mike --

13:54.167 --> 13:57.502
Mike won't admit
that he and I are best friends.

13:57.504 --> 13:58.603
That's something
you want?

13:58.605 --> 13:59.637
[ chuckles ]

13:59.639 --> 14:02.106
And I keep forgetting
that you've met Mike.

14:02.108 --> 14:03.608
I mean, you know,
I-I-I know he loves me.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.443
I just want to know
that he likes me as much

14:05.445 --> 14:07.612
As some guy he hasn't seen
in 10 years.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.447
What do men know
about friendship?
Yeah, I don't know.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.950
I mean, chuck won't even say
that he and Mike are friends.

14:11.952 --> 14:14.953
Oh, god. Men are so afraid
of their feelings.

14:14.955 --> 14:17.121
Mm-hmm.
It's like if they admit
they like each other,

14:17.123 --> 14:19.123
They're on the trail
to "brokeback mountain."

14:19.125 --> 14:22.961
Oh, if being gay means being
able to express your feelings,

14:22.963 --> 14:25.630
I wish our husbands
were more like those two.

14:25.632 --> 14:26.898
Hmm?
Over there.

14:28.467 --> 14:31.569
Mmm. That's amazing.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.338
It tastes amazing.

[ knock on door ]

Hey, uh, so how was lunch
with Ryan?

14:42.148 --> 14:45.416
Does he know anything
about kangaroos?

14:45.418 --> 14:48.653
Lunch was ordered, eaten,
and is now being digested.

14:48.655 --> 14:51.155
So it's not a good time.
[ chuckles ]

14:51.157 --> 14:55.493
All right.
[ clears throat ]

14:55.495 --> 14:57.161
That was my nice way
of asking you

14:57.163 --> 14:59.397
To get the hell out.

15:00.499 --> 15:03.001
Oh, what's bothering you,
son?

15:03.003 --> 15:04.502
Oh, I'm just trying to
work up the courage

15:04.504 --> 15:05.870
To tell you something,
sir.

15:05.872 --> 15:08.506
So spit it out.
You've wasted enough time.

15:08.508 --> 15:13.611
Okay, um, Ryan's
been working here for two weeks.

15:13.613 --> 15:16.714
I'm sorry that was so hard
for you to say.

15:16.716 --> 15:19.384
Uh, no, no, no.
There's -- there's more.

15:19.386 --> 15:20.518
Mm-hmm?

15:20.520 --> 15:23.855
Um, I've been working here
for four years.

15:23.857 --> 15:27.191
I can see how all that math
can be difficult.

15:27.193 --> 15:28.927
It's just that
in all that time,

15:28.929 --> 15:30.428
Not once
have you asked me,

15:30.430 --> 15:32.063
"hey, do you
want to go get lunch?"

15:32.065 --> 15:33.564
I ask you
to get lunch all the time.

15:33.566 --> 15:34.866
You ask me
to get <i>your</i> lunch.

15:34.868 --> 15:37.869
And a lot of times,
I have to pay for it.

15:37.871 --> 15:39.938
You know, by the way,
you owe me $7.

15:40.773 --> 15:41.973
$6.88.

15:41.975 --> 15:44.475
I rounded up 'cause
I'm really upset right now.

Kyle, Kyle. Kyle, wait.
Oh, oh, oh, okay.

15:47.614 --> 15:50.281
I think I understand.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.616
You want to get lunch?

15:51.618 --> 15:53.251
Fine. What do you want me
to get you?

15:53.253 --> 15:55.920
No, Kyle. No, no.
[ chuckles ] no.

15:55.922 --> 15:57.555
Just the two of us --
next week.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.424
We'll spend
some quality time together.

15:59.426 --> 16:02.327
Thank you, sir.
It means a lot to me.

16:02.329 --> 16:03.795
All right.
All right.

16:03.797 --> 16:06.664
Has it really been
four years?

16:06.666 --> 16:09.734
Well, it's only been
3 years, 9 months, and 2 days.

16:11.136 --> 16:13.137
Wow.

16:13.139 --> 16:15.306
Got to get that rounding-up
thing under control.

All right.

This sign
isn't going anywhere,

16:21.748 --> 16:23.081
Whether I want it to
or not --

16:23.083 --> 16:24.482
Much like you
in this neighborhood.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.652
So you still think
I stole your signs?

16:27.654 --> 16:28.753
Well, I don't know.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.755
How about you give me
the key to those locks?

16:30.757 --> 16:34.359
Okay, Baxter.
Sorry I suspected you.

16:34.361 --> 16:35.693
I'm used to
being persecuted.

16:35.695 --> 16:36.928
You have no idea

16:36.930 --> 16:38.329
What it's like being
a white man in America.

16:41.433 --> 16:44.435
Ohh!

16:44.437 --> 16:47.672
I sure hope carol wins.

16:47.674 --> 16:48.840
It'd be a shame
to go through all of this

16:48.842 --> 16:50.608
And not have the house
all to myself.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.711
Yeah, I'd love that --
having no one around to talk to.

16:53.713 --> 16:54.846
Yeah.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.748
I kind of wish
that was happening right now.

16:57.950 --> 17:00.451
Yeah, but I understand,
you know?

17:00.453 --> 17:04.522
My carol [sighs]
she loves to chat.

17:04.524 --> 17:05.723
Yeah, you know why?

17:05.725 --> 17:07.725
'cause wives think
we can be their best friends.

17:07.727 --> 17:09.394
Ah. Now,
how can we be friends?

17:09.396 --> 17:11.696
We're married.

17:13.298 --> 17:14.966
That's what I told
Vanessa.

17:14.968 --> 17:18.636
Wait. You said that?

17:18.638 --> 17:20.138
To your wife?

17:20.140 --> 17:22.473
Out loud?

17:22.475 --> 17:23.708
No, no,
no, no, no, no.

17:23.710 --> 17:27.712
When she asks, you tell her
she's your best friend.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.048
Oh.

17:30.050 --> 17:35.553
Oh. It's so simple.
A little white lie.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.388
You've co-opted
so much of our culture,

We can borrow
from yours.

17:42.661 --> 17:46.664
Fact is, I haven't seen
my real best friend in years.

17:46.666 --> 17:47.832
He might be dead.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.904
Mine, too.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.972
Rick wallace?

17:57.576 --> 17:59.077
Why don't women
understand the value

17:59.079 --> 18:00.578
Of that kind
of friendship?

18:00.580 --> 18:04.182
Yeah, well, until I can hang
with someone I actually enjoy,

18:04.184 --> 18:08.853
Seems like I'm stuck
with the likes of you, Baxter.

18:08.855 --> 18:11.122
That's a bad lot
for the both of us.

18:11.124 --> 18:12.790
Hey, honey.

18:12.792 --> 18:15.126
Hey. Wow.

18:15.128 --> 18:18.262
Looks like you guys worked
really hard to put this sign up.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.397
Take it down.

18:19.399 --> 18:20.932
[ chuckling ] yeah.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.967
We are not
supporting carol.

18:22.969 --> 18:24.969
Well, th-that -- uh,
that sign's not going anywhere.

18:24.971 --> 18:27.305
It'd be easier
for us to move.

18:27.307 --> 18:29.874
Now, I'm sorry, chuck, but
your wife wants to get rid of

18:29.876 --> 18:32.276
The after-school program
for the arts that I started.

18:32.278 --> 18:35.379
It's crazy. She's all
about cutting spending.

18:35.381 --> 18:38.382
What?

18:38.384 --> 18:39.550
Toss some
lights on that.

18:39.552 --> 18:43.254
More people can look
at that thing.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.555
Yeah, well,
believe it or not,

18:44.557 --> 18:46.057
She's more of a conservative
than you are

18:46.059 --> 18:47.158
When it comes to taxes.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.393
Well, now,
what <i>is</i> it about carol

18:49.395 --> 18:51.662
That made you assume
she's liberal?

18:51.664 --> 18:53.331
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.133
It's not
because she's black.

18:55.135 --> 18:59.804
It's because
she's nice and smart.

18:59.806 --> 19:03.741
Just smart enough to realize
the value of arts in school.

19:03.743 --> 19:06.077
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:06.079 --> 19:07.545
Carol is black?

19:10.415 --> 19:14.418
Always
the last to know.

19:14.420 --> 19:16.087
Must upset you because,

19:16.089 --> 19:18.022
You know,
you're such good friends.

19:18.024 --> 19:19.257
Yeah, no,
we're still good friends.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.258
Wait, wait, wait.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.926
She may be your friend,
Vanessa,

19:21.928 --> 19:23.828
But she's my best friend...

19:25.030 --> 19:28.366
...Like husbands and wives
should be.

19:28.368 --> 19:29.500
Good luck, Baxter.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.441
So, now you're
all for carol?

19:37.443 --> 19:40.444
I thought you supported
my arts program.

19:40.446 --> 19:42.280
I did support
your arts program.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.981
Yeah, because
it's a good idea.

19:43.983 --> 19:46.450
It's stupidest idea ever.
Total waste of money.

19:46.452 --> 19:49.287
Art is for
hanging on walls, right?

19:49.289 --> 19:51.622
And ever since the advent
of the plasma screen,

19:51.624 --> 19:54.892
It's pretty much
made art obsolete.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.561
But you helped me
the whole time

19:56.563 --> 19:58.329
I was trying to
push it through --

19:58.331 --> 20:01.299
All the school-board meetings,
all the work to get the funding.

20:01.301 --> 20:04.468
Yeah, but it was
the dumbest idea ever.

20:04.470 --> 20:06.370
Well, then
why did you do it?

20:06.372 --> 20:09.140
I mean, you already said
I'm not your friend.

20:09.142 --> 20:10.808
I wouldn't do it
for my friend,

20:10.810 --> 20:12.343
But I would do it
for my wife.

20:12.345 --> 20:15.713
Oh, honey.

20:17.683 --> 20:19.183
Oh.

20:19.185 --> 20:21.752
Or rick wallace
if he asked.

20:24.156 --> 20:25.256
But he wouldn't

20:25.258 --> 20:26.924
Because that's
what kind of friend he is.

20:35.100 --> 20:37.768
[ chuckles ]

20:37.770 --> 20:38.769
Hey.

20:38.771 --> 20:42.540
Oh, hey. So,
how did the movie date go?

20:42.542 --> 20:44.208
Uh...Terrible.

20:44.210 --> 20:45.676
Yes, I was right!

20:46.778 --> 20:49.547
Oh, I'm so sorry.
What happened?

20:49.549 --> 20:52.550
Wyatt ignored me
the whole time

20:52.552 --> 20:54.285
And then went and made out
with emma haller.

20:54.287 --> 20:55.353
Boom. Just like
I called it.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.854
Unh-unh.
You said sarah.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.956
All emmas are sarahs.

20:58.958 --> 21:01.392
I never want to see
wyatt again.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.094
Wrong. You're gonna
want wyatt around.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.528
Not so you can see him,

21:04.530 --> 21:06.063
But so <i>he</i> can see <i>you</i>
<i>while you're making out</i>

21:06.065 --> 21:07.064
With his best friend.

21:07.066 --> 21:08.366
Oh, no, no, no.
Eve, seriously.

21:08.368 --> 21:10.067
Okay, that is the last thing
you want to do.

21:10.069 --> 21:12.470
You don't want --
ah, bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.639
His best friend
is greg van dorn,

21:14.641 --> 21:16.941
So I want to hear more about
this making-out business.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.609
Yes. Honestly,
don't take any guy advice

21:18.611 --> 21:19.610
From Kristin, all right?

21:19.612 --> 21:21.112
She always played it
way too safe

21:21.114 --> 21:22.446
When it came to boys.

21:22.448 --> 21:25.583
Um, I got pregnant
when I was 17.

21:25.585 --> 21:28.819
Yeah, and who told you
not to go out with Ryan?

21:28.821 --> 21:30.955
Uh, this guy.
