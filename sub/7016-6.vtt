WEBVTT

00:03.509 --> 00:05.629
Oh Steven, there you are.

00:05.664 --> 00:09.400
I almost didn't recognise you without a
disgusting stripper attached to your lips.

00:10.457 --> 00:12.841
Huh. Well I recognised
you right away.

00:12.876 --> 00:16.496
Since you walked in here alone,
with no job and no boyfriend.

00:17.871 --> 00:19.855
Uh, this sounds like fun,

00:21.617 --> 00:23.629
someone say something
mean about me !

00:24.851 --> 00:26.753
I don't think so Fez.

00:26.788 --> 00:28.772
Oh come on, you
never let me play.

00:30.099 --> 00:32.283
Fine. You're stupid
and you're fat.

00:36.705 --> 00:38.693
That was completely
uncalled for...

00:40.672 --> 00:42.608
What is Donna doing
out with Randy ?

00:42.658 --> 00:45.634
When I called her earlier today to
see if she wanted to do something,

00:45.708 --> 00:50.308
she said she was staying in all day. I mean, I was
gonna blow her off at the last minute, but still.

00:51.168 --> 00:55.523
Yeah. And yesterday when I went to spy on her
from her closet, she was already out with Randy.

00:58.378 --> 01:00.882
That guy is really
cutting into my peep-time.

01:03.735 --> 01:06.303
Do you think something is going
on between Donna and Randy ?

01:06.486 --> 01:07.882
Steven, what do you think ?

01:07.928 --> 01:10.333
I have a definite
opinion on this.

01:10.566 --> 01:11.902
I don't care.

01:12.827 --> 01:14.671
Ah you just don't
like to gossip.

01:14.727 --> 01:17.852
Which is good, because â€“oof
- you should hear what people say about you.

01:19.196 --> 01:23.351
Well if you guys are gonna act like a bunch of
immature babies go ahead. Now if you'll excuse me,

01:23.686 --> 01:26.892
I'm gonna drive my car through some really
big puddles and splash some old people.

01:27.975 --> 01:28.793
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.

01:30.268 --> 01:31.602
Where have you two been ?

01:31.636 --> 01:34.080
We went to see Rocky
II. It was awesome.

01:34.118 --> 01:38.662
This chubby guy in the audience got all
inspired and then punched out an usher.

01:39.176 --> 01:41.831
Donna does Eric know you took
another man to the movies ?

01:41.876 --> 01:43.933
Actually, I invited her.

01:43.967 --> 01:45.822
I won tickets from
a radio-station.

01:45.847 --> 01:49.453
My cousin's a DJ so I just called him
up and told him the phrase that pays:

01:49.477 --> 01:52.212
'My mom has a picture of you
and your sister in the bathtub.'

01:53.897 --> 01:57.583
But why I wonder, did you invite
Donna instead of any of us ?

01:57.975 --> 02:00.273
Is it because she
is beautiful, blond

02:00.307 --> 02:03.211
and curvy... actually, you
know what, that's a good choice.

02:04.595 --> 02:06.632
Fries up for
Donna and Randy.

02:06.668 --> 02:07.623
That's us.

02:09.877 --> 02:12.553
Look at them !
They're sharing fries !

02:13.947 --> 02:18.623
I know. And did you see how fast Randy
changed the subject when you mentioned Eric ?

02:18.647 --> 02:20.673
Yeah, something
is definitely up.

02:20.757 --> 02:23.850
The needle on the Hanky-Panky
meter is all the way up to Panky !

02:24.655 --> 02:27.472
You know what ? I think
Donna is cheating on Eric.

02:28.507 --> 02:30.470
Oh my God, I
think you're right.

02:30.615 --> 02:32.382
That is awful.

02:32.815 --> 02:37.142
I can just picture that hot-blooded seductress
giving it away in a sweaty moment of lust.

02:39.276 --> 02:41.323
Oh why do I do
that to myself ?

02:45.175 --> 02:48.510

03:21.535 --> 03:25.481
Kitty ! I just got a letter from
the Point Place Veterans Association.

03:25.846 --> 03:27.463
Our reunion is coming up.

03:27.638 --> 03:33.280
It is so nice to have a place where everyone
applauds after you say how many people you shot.

03:35.386 --> 03:39.432
And this year is gonna be special.
You remember Larry Simmens ?

03:39.458 --> 03:42.363
Oooh, the fellow who won
the Bronze Star on D-Day ?

03:42.397 --> 03:45.201
Yep. The bastard
finally died.

03:46.088 --> 03:47.923
Struck by lightning.

03:48.257 --> 03:51.641
The sucker could dodge a bullet but
Mother Nature got him right in the ass.

03:52.465 --> 03:55.023
Well I hope someone
shouted fire in the hole.

03:56.358 --> 04:00.383
And now that he's gone, I'll be
the most decorated soldier there.

04:00.407 --> 04:04.981
Which means the added respect of
my peers plus enough free booze

04:05.018 --> 04:07.721
fill Mike Kaleighs fake leg.

04:08.548 --> 04:12.371
You know, whenever you soldier buddies
get together you have cocktails.

04:12.418 --> 04:14.382
I should have
been in the army.

04:16.425 --> 04:17.481
Hey look !

04:17.524 --> 04:20.492
I finally got invited to the
Point Place Veterans reunion.

04:20.515 --> 04:21.262
What ?

04:21.798 --> 04:24.062
They don't invite
National Guardsmen.

04:24.095 --> 04:25.092
They didn't,

04:25.195 --> 04:28.650
but I wrote a bunch of angry letters
until they changed their policy.

04:30.568 --> 04:32.723
Well that's just great Bob.

04:32.837 --> 04:35.773
Maybe if you'd written a bunch
of angry letters to Hitler

04:35.808 --> 04:38.032
we could've avoided a
war in the first place.

04:39.336 --> 04:41.193
I don't think that
would have worked.

04:41.778 --> 04:45.152
That Hitler seemed
like a real cranky bear.

04:46.966 --> 04:50.091
Oh Red, the vets needed
someone to hire a photographer,

04:50.137 --> 04:52.183
so I signed you
up to find one.

04:52.448 --> 04:54.390
Why would you do that ?

04:55.135 --> 04:57.600
Because I felt like
I wasn't contributing.

04:58.567 --> 05:00.561
You should hire Leo to
be your photographer.

05:00.597 --> 05:03.402
He's like a pro.
Shot all my fake ID's.

05:04.477 --> 05:08.142
I'm not taking a Hippie down to the
Veterans hall. They wouldn't put up with it.

05:08.175 --> 05:10.933
The bathrooms have Jane
Fonda urinal targets.

05:13.058 --> 05:14.221
You know,

05:14.377 --> 05:18.782
Leo took some pretty great pictures of
Bob and Midge when they renewed their vows.

05:19.098 --> 05:21.880
He even got a rare
one of Red smiling.

05:24.448 --> 05:26.542
I sent it to the museum.

05:28.036 --> 05:30.491
Well, if you wanna ask him,
he's down in the basement.

05:31.006 --> 05:33.820
What's Leo doing
in my basement ?

05:34.206 --> 05:35.712
I... don't know.

05:37.688 --> 05:39.372
But just to be safe,

05:39.396 --> 05:42.112
why don't you give it about 15
minutes before you come down ?

05:46.978 --> 05:50.610
So, Leo. Steven tells me
that you're photographer.

05:50.825 --> 05:52.063
How much do you charge ?

05:52.105 --> 05:55.901
Not much man. I try to pay
for everything with cash.

05:57.565 --> 05:58.800
Okay, never mind.

05:59.715 --> 06:02.933
No. Come on Red, he 's really good and he
works cheap. Leo, tell him what your fee is.

06:02.976 --> 06:04.293
A hundred bucks.

06:04.338 --> 06:05.560
How about 75 ?

06:05.596 --> 06:08.330
50 dollars and
that's my final offer.

06:12.078 --> 06:15.943
And if you bargain with him when you get
there, you probably wind up making ten bucks.

06:17.256 --> 06:18.383
Fifteen.

06:23.246 --> 06:24.882
Okay fine, you're hired.

06:25.215 --> 06:27.100
But this is a
big night for me.

06:27.147 --> 06:29.960
So I want you to
clean up and look nice.

06:30.005 --> 06:33.003
These men are veterans.
They deserve your respect.

06:33.328 --> 06:35.683
Hey I'm cool
with veterans man.

06:36.016 --> 06:39.460
Anybody that can put a
cast on a dog is okay by me.

06:46.815 --> 06:49.193
Hey if you guys see Donna, can
you tell her I'm down at the Hub ?

06:49.376 --> 06:51.691
Okay... did you
guys have plans ?

06:51.897 --> 06:54.383
Yeah, we were gonna
hang out at her house but

06:54.428 --> 06:56.630
I get a little
uncomfortable with Bob there.

06:56.676 --> 06:59.500
You know, most people wear
underwear when they wear a robe.

07:07.006 --> 07:08.291
Did you hear that ?

07:08.608 --> 07:09.823
"Hang out".

07:10.715 --> 07:12.380
They are going to have sex.

07:13.508 --> 07:15.732
How does 'hang out"
mean "have sex" ?

07:15.777 --> 07:18.292
I can make a sexual
innuendo out of anything.

07:18.675 --> 07:19.720
Try me.

07:19.885 --> 07:20.751
Uhm...

07:21.877 --> 07:22.810
stove.

07:23.156 --> 07:25.410
Well I'd like to cook
something on her stove.

07:26.398 --> 07:28.141
See ? Anything !

07:30.156 --> 07:32.990
Oh my God Fez, I feel
really bad for Eric.

07:33.048 --> 07:35.691
When Michael was cheating
on me, I was devastated.

07:35.717 --> 07:38.031
But eventually I learned
that the saying is true.

07:38.065 --> 07:41.040
It's better to have love and
lost then to be butt-ugly.

07:42.585 --> 07:43.910
Oh hey Miss Kitty.

07:43.945 --> 07:44.910
Hi.

07:44.947 --> 07:47.280
Okay. We need some advice.

07:47.908 --> 07:53.103
There is this guy, who's uh
girlfriend is cheating on him.

07:53.156 --> 07:54.850
What do you think
we should do ?

07:55.618 --> 07:59.053
Well, Red and I once had a
friend named Bill Anderson

07:59.146 --> 08:01.621
and everyone thought his
wife was cheating on him,

08:01.706 --> 08:06.472
so one night, we were over there
and I happened to see her purse and

08:06.515 --> 08:08.581
it happened to be open and

08:08.865 --> 08:11.003
I happened to
rifle through it

08:11.678 --> 08:13.583
and I found out it was true.

08:14.038 --> 08:15.231
So you told Bill ?

08:15.265 --> 08:19.933
No no no no, I do not like to get
involved in other people's business.

08:20.586 --> 08:22.560
But, I wish I had.

08:22.595 --> 08:27.031
Because it might have saved their marriage
and I'd still be getting their Christmas cards.

08:27.805 --> 08:32.070
Antlers on a dog,
that is so precious.

08:34.292 --> 08:36.378
Fez, I know what
we need to do.

08:36.418 --> 08:39.984
Yeah, me too. But where are we
going to find a dog with antlers ?

08:41.298 --> 08:45.318
No Fez, we need to write Eric a letter telling
him what is going on between Donna and Randy.

08:45.356 --> 08:50.882
Yeah, then Eric is gonna come home, kick Randy's
ass and then whisk Donna off to someplace sexy.

08:52.786 --> 08:54.081
Like the garage.

08:54.105 --> 08:55.050
What ?

08:55.908 --> 08:58.363
How is the garage sexy ?

08:58.586 --> 09:00.911
Well I'd like to park
my car in her garage.

09:07.407 --> 09:08.420
Leo ?

09:08.835 --> 09:12.452
This is an important event. I
thought I told you to clean up.

09:12.497 --> 09:13.951
I did man.

09:14.847 --> 09:17.023
My apartment is spotless.

09:18.328 --> 09:21.711
You're supposed to wear a
military uniform to these things.

09:21.806 --> 09:23.741
That's why I
rented this baby.

09:25.458 --> 09:29.290
Just be ready with that camera Leo.
And keep it pointed nice and low,

09:29.325 --> 09:34.010
I want a lot of close-ups of all
those patriotic men kissing my ass.

09:37.808 --> 09:39.571
Hey there soldiers.

09:39.958 --> 09:42.540
Holy cow ! Look who it is !

09:42.577 --> 09:45.262
- As you were men.
- It's Leonard !

09:47.076 --> 09:48.930
Leonard ? Who the
hell is Leonard ?

09:48.976 --> 09:50.381
Hey I'm Leonard.

09:51.955 --> 09:53.360
- Hey !
- Hi there !

09:55.746 --> 09:56.721
Hey,

09:57.047 --> 09:58.691
how do you guys know him ?!

09:58.728 --> 10:01.721
We drove a supply truck
together during WW II !

10:01.767 --> 10:02.752
Leo ?

10:02.976 --> 10:04.500
You're a veteran ?!

10:04.678 --> 10:06.283
How come you never told me ?

10:06.616 --> 10:09.643
Well there is a lot of things
you don't know about me man.

10:10.388 --> 10:11.452
For instance,

10:11.897 --> 10:13.262
I'm a veteran.

10:18.305 --> 10:21.231
It's been two weeks since
we send Eric our letter.

10:21.295 --> 10:23.143
Shouldn't he
be home by now ?

10:23.557 --> 10:25.851
Well it takes about a week
to get a letter to Africa,

10:25.896 --> 10:28.881
then there is three days of
Eric twitching and fidgeting,

10:29.368 --> 10:32.140
oh, and there is a two day
hippo-ride to the airport, so...

10:32.996 --> 10:35.442
yeah, he should
be home by now.

10:36.836 --> 10:38.881
When is Samantha
coming back anyway ?

10:38.926 --> 10:42.063
Oh she's gotta stay in Vegas for another
week 'cause there's a doctors convention.

10:42.096 --> 10:45.733
Which proves my theorie that no-one
gets tired of seeing naked ladies.

10:47.428 --> 10:49.703
Hey Donna, I'm
glad you're here.

10:49.857 --> 10:51.360
Have you heard from Eric ?

10:51.426 --> 10:53.470
You know, your
supposed boyfriend ?

10:55.898 --> 10:58.722
Uhm... actually I haven't
heard from Eric in a while.

10:59.028 --> 11:00.333
Rrreally...

11:02.906 --> 11:05.722
Hey look Fez, it says right here
some moron got punched in the arm

11:05.778 --> 11:08.043
for sticking his nose
where it didn't belong.

11:10.555 --> 11:11.450
When ?

11:12.687 --> 11:13.832
Uh... now

11:16.216 --> 11:17.043
So

11:17.538 --> 11:22.493
Donna. I don't know, is there any
relationship news you'd like to share with us ?

11:22.605 --> 11:24.843
Look, I really don't
want to talk about it.

11:24.887 --> 11:28.872
Oh. So that means... there
is something to talk about ?

11:28.935 --> 11:31.461
Yeah. Spill it girl !

11:33.117 --> 11:34.500
Will you just drop it ?

11:34.525 --> 11:36.892
No. Not until you tell us
when Eric is coming home.

11:36.928 --> 11:40.381
What ? He is not coming
home. Eric broke up with me.

11:40.428 --> 11:41.463
YESSS !

11:45.006 --> 11:49.392
Is not what you say when
you hear that news...

11:56.496 --> 11:59.352
Did you two have something to do
with Forman and Donna breaking up ?!

11:59.397 --> 12:01.003
ARE YOU SUGGESTING...

12:01.388 --> 12:02.633
Yeah, yes we did.

12:05.255 --> 12:06.773
BUT WE NEVER...

12:07.057 --> 12:08.643
actually we did that too.

12:10.058 --> 12:12.231
BUT YOU CAN ALSO BLAME...

12:14.508 --> 12:16.283
ah shoot, there is
no-one else to blame.

12:17.988 --> 12:23.441
Look Steven, all we did was write a letter to Eric
telling him that Donna was cheating on him with Randy.

12:24.047 --> 12:26.283
Wh... My magic eightball
said it was a good idea

12:26.327 --> 12:30.531
and that things is right like what... one out
of six times which is pretty good for a ball.

12:31.845 --> 12:35.281
If you two were puppies, I'd smack
you in the nose with a magazine.

12:36.558 --> 12:37.512
In fact.

12:40.348 --> 12:43.051
You two idiots need to
tell Donna what you did.

12:43.976 --> 12:45.990
Are you kidding ? No no no,

12:46.025 --> 12:48.512
she'll stomp on us
with her giant feet.

12:49.788 --> 12:53.210
I do not want the last words
I hear to be Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum !

12:53.688 --> 12:56.460
Yeah. It's gonna get ugly. That's
why I'm gonna come with you.

12:56.485 --> 12:57.662
To protect us ?

12:57.716 --> 12:59.102
No, to watch.

13:02.077 --> 13:05.430
I can't believe that
Leo is a veteran.

13:05.467 --> 13:09.631
I don't know wheter to like him a
little more or like myself a little less.

13:10.885 --> 13:13.280
Red, this was supposed
to be your special night.

13:13.326 --> 13:15.901
We should be the ones over
there getting free drinks.

13:15.946 --> 13:16.882
"We" ?

13:17.915 --> 13:20.411
I spent all my money
on this costume.

13:24.548 --> 13:27.443
So Leo, what exactly
did you do in the war ?

13:27.475 --> 13:30.422
I mean, just besides
drive a supply truck.

13:30.578 --> 13:33.010
Just drive a supply truck ?!

13:33.097 --> 13:35.152
Leo, did you tell
them what you did ?

13:35.328 --> 13:37.992
Nah. It's embarrassing.

13:38.935 --> 13:40.640
You gotta tell 'm !

13:40.926 --> 13:41.870
Alright.

13:42.366 --> 13:44.432
I peed on Jane Fonda.

13:46.997 --> 13:52.541
Leo here drove his truck right into a German
tank formation and rescued an entire platoon.

13:53.106 --> 13:54.081
Really ?!

13:54.268 --> 13:55.733
Didn't you get a
medal for that ?

13:55.798 --> 14:00.162
Yeah. I forget what it was called,
but it was shaped like a purple heart.

14:01.445 --> 14:02.740
Damn Leo.

14:03.727 --> 14:05.211
I'm impressed.

14:05.948 --> 14:09.460
From one veteran to another,
I'd like to buy you a drink.

14:09.936 --> 14:12.113
Actually I'd like
to buy you a drink.

14:12.358 --> 14:13.681
I'll take a drink.

14:16.186 --> 14:17.072
Sorry.

14:17.298 --> 14:20.330
This round is for men
who fought for Uncle Sam.

14:20.375 --> 14:23.211
Not spent the war hiding
in their Uncle Sam's house.

14:24.727 --> 14:28.853
Hey man, even if he didn't see
action, he still deserves a drink.

14:28.925 --> 14:30.210
Alright fine.

14:30.515 --> 14:31.610
Bartender,

14:31.998 --> 14:33.792
one Shirley Temple !

14:42.826 --> 14:47.843
Hey Donna, sorry to interrupt, but
uh Nancy Drew and Nancy-boy here

14:48.877 --> 14:50.683
have someting they'd
like to tell you.

14:51.138 --> 14:54.030
That's where Fez comes
in. Take it away Fez.

14:55.097 --> 14:56.882
You sneaky
little midget... !

15:00.685 --> 15:02.761
Okay... uh...

15:02.805 --> 15:03.723
Donna,

15:04.998 --> 15:06.722
we are the reason why
Eric broke up with you.

15:06.757 --> 15:09.881
We wrote him a letter saying that
you were cheating with Mr. Fancy-Hair.

15:11.075 --> 15:11.912
What ?

15:11.936 --> 15:14.270
Oh come on, how does
he even do that ?

15:15.055 --> 15:16.991
Let me clear a
couple things up.

15:17.035 --> 15:21.352
Donna and I are just friends and
I blow dry this hair upside down.

15:22.587 --> 15:25.220
Why would you even think that
I was cheating with Randy ?

15:25.256 --> 15:27.603
Oh they have it on the
strongest authority.

15:27.667 --> 15:30.903
A fluid-filled plastic novelty
ball from PerkaBrothers.

15:32.605 --> 15:36.241
Look the reason that we've been
hanging out so much lately is because

15:36.536 --> 15:39.791
Randy was the only one I could talk
to about how Eric broke up with me.

15:40.886 --> 15:42.491
Three weeks ago.

15:42.826 --> 15:44.832
Three weeks ago
? That means...

15:44.875 --> 15:48.781
That he broke up with you before we sent
the letter ! Fez it's not our fault !

15:48.805 --> 15:52.382
Oh ! Eric just doesn't like
Donna anymore ! Oh happy day !

15:54.635 --> 15:55.882
Why didn't you tell us ?

15:55.927 --> 15:59.513
Because... I knew that if I told
you guys, Fez would only hit on me.

16:00.898 --> 16:05.312
Jackie would hurt my feelings trying to be
nice and you would just shrug and go "neh".

16:06.496 --> 16:08.720
- How can you say that ?
- Tell me I'm wrong.

16:09.345 --> 16:10.160
Neh.

16:11.745 --> 16:14.541
And it's not like I was
looking for Randy. I mean,

16:14.587 --> 16:19.290
I was taking the garbage out one day, he was
playing hoops and he said: Hey how is it going ?

16:19.356 --> 16:23.553
So I took the basketball, I threw it
through a window and burst into tears.

16:25.045 --> 16:27.691
I think that's when he knew
that something was wrong.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.573
I'm very astute.

16:31.718 --> 16:35.552
And he's been really great. He
listened, he brought me stuff.

16:35.655 --> 16:38.160
Ice cream, Kleenex
and bubble-bath.

16:38.196 --> 16:41.230
It's the universal break-up
kit. I read about it in Vogue.

16:43.696 --> 16:45.390
I have five sisters.

16:46.656 --> 16:49.281
Fine I don't have any
sisters, I read Vogue !

16:50.298 --> 16:52.313
Donna this must have
been really hard on you.

16:52.377 --> 16:53.280
Yeah.

16:53.806 --> 16:55.882
I can't believe Eric
and Donna are through.

16:56.118 --> 16:59.403
I always thought they'd live happily
ever after, like Romeo and Juliet.

17:00.686 --> 17:03.132
Have you ever read
Romeo and Juliet ?

17:03.206 --> 17:06.112
I didn't have to finish it.
It is so obvious what happens.

17:07.645 --> 17:10.351
I'm sorry, I should have never
accused you for cheating on Eric.

17:10.396 --> 17:12.012
Yeah, and Randy,

17:12.117 --> 17:13.872
I owe you an apology.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.001
Not just for the letter,

17:16.478 --> 17:18.512
but for letting the
air out of your tyres.

17:20.127 --> 17:22.362
That's okay man. We're even.

17:22.605 --> 17:24.041
We are ? What
did you do to me ?

17:24.067 --> 17:24.771
THIS !

17:27.298 --> 17:28.820
I heard that makes
you pee yourself !

17:28.875 --> 17:29.861
That's ridiculous.

17:39.168 --> 17:40.662
THIS ISN'T OVER !

17:43.397 --> 17:46.830
I'm so surprised that
you were in the army Leo.

17:46.866 --> 17:49.941
I just can't picture
you shining your shoes.

17:50.655 --> 17:53.660
Can't really picture
you finding your shoes...

17:55.165 --> 17:58.743
Yeah well I fought for my country
and I have the scars to prove it.

17:58.785 --> 18:00.400
Hey, me too.

18:01.276 --> 18:04.803
Look at that,
Guadalcanal 1942.

18:04.847 --> 18:07.852
I took some shrapnel, spent
a month in the hospital.

18:08.006 --> 18:09.791
That's how I met Bob Hope.

18:10.768 --> 18:14.022
Bastard made me laugh even
though I had two busted ribs.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.733
Dumb-ass comedian...

18:19.565 --> 18:20.912
Check this out.

18:23.446 --> 18:25.422
I don't see anything.

18:25.688 --> 18:28.253
Yeah, it's more of
an emotional scar.

18:29.596 --> 18:33.501
Leo I don't understand how you
could go from decorated war hero

18:33.558 --> 18:35.232
to hippy degenerate.

18:35.916 --> 18:38.520
Well it all started the day
I got back to the States...

18:41.025 --> 18:43.772
My buddy and I
were saying goodbye.

18:43.938 --> 18:46.181
What are you gonna do now
that the war is over Leonard ?

18:46.217 --> 18:48.901
First I'm going back home to work
in my Dad's pharmacy for a bit

18:48.938 --> 18:51.732
and then it's off
to medical school.

18:52.046 --> 18:53.352
So long pal.

18:56.707 --> 19:00.372
And then these jazz-musicians
pulled up in a car.

19:06.058 --> 19:07.262
Hey soldier.

19:07.376 --> 19:08.561
Do you need a ride ?

19:08.707 --> 19:11.322
No, It's smells
kinda funny in there.

19:12.778 --> 19:15.392
Don't worry kid.
You'll get used to it.

19:23.037 --> 19:27.041
And that's the last thing I remember
until you poured me this cup of coffee.

19:34.848 --> 19:35.760
Yep.

19:36.635 --> 19:37.791
- Hey man.
- Hey.

19:38.285 --> 19:40.080
Brought you something
to cheer you up.

19:42.835 --> 19:44.380
A picture of Eric...

19:44.848 --> 19:45.912
And a lighter !

19:49.787 --> 19:50.832
Thanks.

19:51.436 --> 19:52.861
I'll burn it later.

19:58.455 --> 20:00.113
I don't really
know what to say.

20:00.328 --> 20:01.622
Wanna tell me
what happened ?

20:01.668 --> 20:03.082
Yeah I mean,

20:03.135 --> 20:06.432
it wasn't really that
big of a surprise.

20:07.217 --> 20:11.921
Eric said that ever since he left for Africa
he felt that our lives were drifting apart.

20:12.167 --> 20:14.191
So he decided,

20:14.738 --> 20:17.800
for the both of us, that
we should move on. So...

20:18.186 --> 20:19.543
I guess we moved on.

20:19.727 --> 20:20.723
You alright ?

20:20.966 --> 20:21.812
Yeah.

20:22.527 --> 20:23.663
I will be.

20:26.398 --> 20:27.831
Eventually.

20:31.617 --> 20:32.431
Well,

20:33.078 --> 20:35.361
if you need anything,
you know where I'll be.

20:35.408 --> 20:36.490
Thanks Hyde.

20:46.207 --> 20:48.171
And if you need
anything from me,

20:49.298 --> 20:50.623
you know where I'll be.

20:53.057 --> 20:54.251
Thanks Fez.

21:01.047 --> 21:05.773
Dear Eric, it turns out Donna
wasn't doing it with Randy after all.

21:05.805 --> 21:08.140
We jumped to the
wrong conclusion.

21:08.335 --> 21:11.690
But I learned my lesson.
And it won't happen again.

21:12.756 --> 21:15.802
It was so nice
having you over Leo.

21:15.966 --> 21:17.622
And have a safe trip home.

21:19.246 --> 21:22.002
And don't worry. I
remember where I live.

21:25.695 --> 21:27.982
Eric, I have horrible news !

21:28.017 --> 21:30.880
Your Mom and Leo are
having an affair !
