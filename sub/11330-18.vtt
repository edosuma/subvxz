00:00.168 --> 00:03.142
Previously on The Secret Life
of the American Teenager...

00:03.143 --> 00:05.111
I'm not gay.
What are you talking about?

00:05.112 --> 00:07.615
Your father saw me talking
to Nora a few weeks ago,

00:07.616 --> 00:09.935
and then he accused me of looking at her.

00:09.936 --> 00:11.872
I don't know if Amy's feeling confined

00:11.873 --> 00:15.270
or it's just something hormonal,
but something's up with her.

00:15.271 --> 00:16.286
I need a vacation.

00:16.286 --> 00:18.574
That's not a vacation, traveling
with Robie by yourself.

00:18.575 --> 00:20.739
What makes you feel like you
have to get married now?

00:20.740 --> 00:21.572
I'm late.

00:21.731 --> 00:24.034
Why haven't we met your stepmother?

00:24.035 --> 00:25.618
They're actually going through a divorce.

00:25.619 --> 00:27.810
Betty knew I was in love with
Camille when she left me.

00:27.811 --> 00:28.874
I'm a generous man.

00:28.875 --> 00:30.931
I'm going to make a check out
for three million dollars.

00:30.932 --> 00:33.899
We have a brother we never knew about.

00:33.900 --> 00:36.721
You know, I actually thought
that I killed Dad by having sex

00:36.722 --> 00:38.385
and then I find out that every year

00:38.386 --> 00:40.936
he's going on these missions
and cheating on Mom!

00:40.937 --> 00:44.048
If I don't see you before you
leave, have a great trip.

00:44.049 --> 00:46.129
Thanks, Nora. Any time.

00:46.130 --> 00:47.889
I want you to take your check back.

00:47.890 --> 00:50.057
Mr. Boykewich is a nice man.

00:50.058 --> 00:51.273
Can't you see that?

00:51.274 --> 00:52.459
Everything's fine.

00:55.066 --> 00:56.314
Nice to meet you, Grace.

00:56.338 --> 00:57.609
I'll be at Adrian's.

01:00.691 --> 01:01.947
Hey! Is he ready?

01:03.652 --> 01:04.779
I'll drop him off.

01:05.251 --> 01:06.092
I got it.

01:10.642 --> 01:11.706
Why's he wearing that?

01:11.747 --> 01:14.723
Because we're going to the
beach, aren't we, John?

01:14.787 --> 01:16.363
The beach? What about work?

01:16.394 --> 01:18.242
You have to go to work, and
John has to go to the nursery.

01:18.243 --> 01:19.938
No, remember?
I told you I have the day off.

01:19.939 --> 01:23.194
Oh. Right. You did tell me.

01:23.603 --> 01:26.185
But you also told me that there's laundry

01:26.186 --> 01:29.185
and we need groceries and the
bathroom could use scrubbing.

01:29.186 --> 01:29.800
That's what you said.

01:29.801 --> 01:31.313
You didn't say anything
about going to the beach.

01:31.314 --> 01:33.041
I know, but I read the weather forecast

01:33.042 --> 01:35.129
and it's going to be really
hot and I want to get out.

01:35.130 --> 01:37.025
The other stuff will get
done when it gets done.

01:37.026 --> 01:39.885
And I'll do it, just not today,
I want to get out today.

01:39.886 --> 01:41.210
Aren't you hot in that?

01:41.970 --> 01:43.730
I didn't have any clean clothes.

01:45.146 --> 01:46.261
We'll see you when you get home.

01:48.169 --> 01:50.298
Okay, well. Just so you know,

01:50.690 --> 01:51.969
I really want to go.

01:52.290 --> 01:54.192
Yeah, well, every day you
want to do something

01:54.193 --> 01:55.824
other than go to school and to work,

01:55.825 --> 01:57.969
but that's your summer, school and work.

01:57.970 --> 02:00.155
Those are the choices you
made, so live with it.

02:00.578 --> 02:02.535
Why don't you just tell me you told me so?

02:02.536 --> 02:03.994
You told me not to go to summer school.

02:03.995 --> 02:06.585
I told you so. And just because
you can't go to the beach

02:06.586 --> 02:08.121
doesn't mean that we can't go.

02:08.122 --> 02:10.633
You mean just like Ashley
gets to go to Europe with Mom

02:10.633 --> 02:12.841
doesn't mean I get to? Yeah, like that.

02:12.842 --> 02:15.489
You can go to the beach Saturday
when you're off and I'm working,

02:15.490 --> 02:18.217
or the three of us can go
Sunday when we're both off.

02:18.218 --> 02:20.777
The beach is too crowded on the weekends.

02:22.617 --> 02:24.568
I'll just call in sick, I'll go with you.

02:24.569 --> 02:26.401
Call in sick to school and to work?

02:26.402 --> 02:28.050
Unless you just don't want me to go.

02:28.522 --> 02:30.877
I want you to go, but you can't.

02:31.626 --> 02:33.330
So we'll see you when you get home.

02:33.913 --> 02:34.929
Look, Amy, I love you,

02:34.930 --> 02:36.752
even though you're kind
of being selfish here

02:36.753 --> 02:38.902
and your selfishness is spilling over to me

02:38.903 --> 02:41.047
and not just me, but John.

02:41.294 --> 02:43.146
Okay, okay. You're right.

02:43.810 --> 02:45.250
I'm not being a very good mom.

02:45.562 --> 02:47.977
Or girlfriend or fiancee or whatever.

02:47.978 --> 02:49.066
Whatever.

02:51.130 --> 02:52.521
Have a good time.

02:53.578 --> 02:55.290
I'll see you later, okay, John?

02:57.737 --> 02:58.474
Bye.

03:01.833 --> 03:02.865
See you later, Amy.

03:09.872 --> 03:11.119
It's going to be really
hot out today, you know.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.409
Not where I'm going.

03:12.625 --> 03:15.712
You know, our offices are
the same temperature

03:15.713 --> 03:18.416
as the meat locker in the butcher shop.

03:18.441 --> 03:19.456
Do you have to go in today?

03:20.352 --> 03:21.840
I have to go and I want to go.

03:21.841 --> 03:23.455
Can't Leo answer his own damn phone?

03:23.456 --> 03:24.549
I guess he could,

03:24.550 --> 03:27.109
but I want the job of
answering his own damn phone.

03:27.198 --> 03:30.325
And I don't want to stay home
and babysit you and Robie.

03:31.517 --> 03:34.301
Come on. You told Anne
you'd take care of him,

03:34.302 --> 03:35.294
so take care of him.

03:35.670 --> 03:37.012
And enjoy your time with him,

03:37.013 --> 03:38.573
she's gonna be back in a couple of weeks

03:38.574 --> 03:42.701
and then you won't have him
around every day to enjoy.

03:42.702 --> 03:45.485
I know, but I miss having someone
around to share him with.

03:45.573 --> 03:47.870
And I'm bored. And it's hot. I hate hot.

03:48.886 --> 03:49.806
And I gotta go.

03:51.174 --> 03:51.838
Bye.

Hello? Hey, what are you doing today?

04:03.551 --> 04:04.639
Are you working? Are you not working?

04:04.919 --> 04:05.871
You want to hang out?

04:06.071 --> 04:07.289
I'm not working,

04:07.327 --> 04:09.735
but as much as I'd love to
hang out with you and Robie,

04:09.736 --> 04:11.031
I'm taking John to the beach.

04:11.032 --> 04:12.430
The beach? In this weather?

04:12.431 --> 04:14.152
It's going to be 100 degrees, maybe higher.

04:14.336 --> 04:16.247
Not at the beach.
It'll be cooler at the beach.

04:16.248 --> 04:18.759
Tell you what. Come by and
pick us up, and we'll all go.

04:18.863 --> 04:21.071
Didn't you once tell me how
much you hate the beach?

04:21.735 --> 04:23.728
No, wasn't me, I love the beach.

04:23.872 --> 04:25.920
All right, we'll be there in a few minutes.

04:25.921 --> 04:26.808
Perfect.

04:29.912 --> 04:31.912
Hey. No matter what,

04:32.080 --> 04:33.752
you and I are going to have a good summer.

04:34.736 --> 04:35.551
Promise.

And I'm here with you.

04:57.853 --> 04:59.677
I can't believe I let
you talk me into this.

04:59.781 --> 05:02.061
Your attitude sucks, you know that?

05:02.413 --> 05:05.051
And what happened to you
being all excited and happy

05:05.052 --> 05:06.549
that you're not pregnant again?

05:06.668 --> 05:08.356
That lasted what, five minutes?

05:08.357 --> 05:10.166
Well, how long is it supposed to last?

05:10.405 --> 05:12.084
Okay, all right, fine.

05:12.085 --> 05:15.108
But you'd think he'd still be
excited over that proposal.

05:15.109 --> 05:16.510
And a few weeks later you're back to

05:16.511 --> 05:18.038
complaining like it never happened.

05:18.039 --> 05:19.671
I am happy and excited.

05:19.743 --> 05:21.302
Uh, no, you're not.

05:21.303 --> 05:24.663
Okay, It's not everything, okay?

05:25.102 --> 05:27.021
And I'm hot. It's hot in here.

05:27.022 --> 05:29.294
Uh-huh. And Ricky and John are at the beach

05:29.295 --> 05:32.319
where it's nice and cool and
they're having a good time.

05:32.383 --> 05:35.766
You know, I thought more
fun than it is, too.

05:35.767 --> 05:38.310
But my best friend slept with my boyfriend

05:38.311 --> 05:41.646
and my other best friend, you,
are not any fun at all.

05:41.647 --> 05:43.639
Thanks a lot. You're welcome.

05:44.148 --> 05:46.780
Your attitude sucks. It's contagious.

05:46.781 --> 05:48.284
And now I have a sucky attitude

05:48.285 --> 05:50.965
and I'm not about anything either.

05:57.972 --> 05:59.499
Good morning. Is it?

05:59.500 --> 06:00.773
No, not for me.

06:00.949 --> 06:02.860
I have no friends here, no one likes me

06:02.861 --> 06:04.060
and no one wants to hang out with me.

06:04.061 --> 06:06.499
I tell you this Margaret is relying on you

06:06.500 --> 06:08.428
to make summer school a
good experience for me.

06:08.429 --> 06:11.869
Yeah, well, let me a
good experience for you.

06:11.964 --> 06:13.282
It's all about attitude.

06:13.283 --> 06:15.114
You need to change your
attitude, you know that?

06:15.115 --> 06:17.753
If your life isn't then
do something about it.

06:17.754 --> 06:20.035
Stop being who you are and
be who you want to be.

06:20.403 --> 06:22.502
Sometimes when people tell me what to do,

06:22.503 --> 06:25.050
I find they're telling me what
they think they should do.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.369
I think it's called transference.

06:28.064 --> 06:30.385
Are you transferring feelings
about yourself onto me?

06:31.161 --> 06:32.041
No.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.625
No, I don't know. I doubt it.

06:34.929 --> 06:37.031
It's hotter than hell in here
and it's eight in the morning.

06:37.032 --> 06:38.736
Even juvie had air conditioning.

06:43.209 --> 06:44.249
Good morning.

06:44.984 --> 06:46.145
Good morning.

06:46.537 --> 06:48.328
So, this is your big surprise?

06:48.329 --> 06:49.480
Yeah, how do you like it?

06:49.481 --> 06:51.408
I'm not sure. What's going on?

06:51.441 --> 06:53.887
The four of you to head back to school.

06:53.888 --> 06:55.122
Yeah. We just thought that

06:55.123 --> 06:57.215
since we can't hang out
at your house or my house

06:57.216 --> 06:58.929
that we'd hang out with you here.

06:59.105 --> 07:01.721
Here? How are you going to do that?

07:02.001 --> 07:03.017
Blend.

07:03.433 --> 07:05.072
Yeah. That's our plan.

07:05.073 --> 07:06.297
Blend.

07:06.593 --> 07:09.089
I'm not so sure you can blend in here.

07:09.305 --> 07:11.537
Please. We can blend, we know how to blend.

07:11.810 --> 07:12.809
Watch this.

07:13.545 --> 07:15.984
Hi. I'm new here,

07:15.985 --> 07:17.240
and I just started this summer

07:17.241 --> 07:19.376
so I could kind of get used to the school

07:19.377 --> 07:21.505
before everyone comes back in the fall.

07:21.529 --> 07:23.961
Could you counselor's office is?

07:23.962 --> 07:26.985
I was there but I can't find it.

07:27.008 --> 07:28.274
Sure, no problem.

07:31.097 --> 07:33.121
That, my friend, is blending.

07:33.257 --> 07:34.696
It's part of Ninja training.

07:34.697 --> 07:36.832
Only you wouldn't see a
real Ninja of course.

07:37.049 --> 07:39.160
That's the They're invisible..

07:39.466 --> 07:41.624
That's a concept that Hollywood
has failed to grasp.

07:41.673 --> 07:42.868
Do Ninjas sweat?

07:42.881 --> 07:44.080
Never. Why?

07:44.145 --> 07:46.017
There's no air conditioning in this school.

07:47.441 --> 07:49.512
Yeah. Maybe we won't blend.

07:49.561 --> 07:53.131
Yeah, I don't want to touch
anyone's sweat outside bed.

07:53.132 --> 07:54.670
There's no air conditioning? Nope.

07:54.932 --> 07:56.821
You just want us to go home, don't you?

08:02.709 --> 08:05.208
You're not disappointed this
is the surprise, are you?

08:05.209 --> 08:07.785
No, no, no, no. This is a great surprise.

08:08.225 --> 08:09.728
I was just hoping that you were coming here

08:09.729 --> 08:11.664
to tell me changed their mind

08:11.665 --> 08:13.186
about letting you go out with me.

08:13.187 --> 08:14.559
If we rely on our parents to say

08:14.560 --> 08:16.143
when and where we can see each other again,

08:16.144 --> 08:17.713
we may never see each other again.

08:20.012 --> 08:20.985
Good morning, Ben.

08:21.545 --> 08:22.808
Good morning...

08:22.809 --> 08:24.617
I'm Ben's cousin.

08:25.266 --> 08:28.185
I'm from Chicago.
We're visiting Ben and his dad.

08:28.337 --> 08:31.574
My dad was Ben's mother's brother.

08:31.575 --> 08:33.854
We don't get to see each other very often

08:33.855 --> 08:36.902
and Ben was going to ask if I can

08:36.903 --> 08:39.390
just hang out and observe today,

08:39.390 --> 08:43.110
because otherwise we may not
be able to see him at all.

08:43.111 --> 08:44.723
Maybe for years.

08:44.724 --> 08:46.940
Well, I guess we can work something out.

08:46.988 --> 08:48.829
Really? Thank you.

08:49.421 --> 08:52.333
I'll text Uncle King so
he can let the driver go.

08:52.775 --> 08:56.052
Ben, I'll let your teachers know
that you have a visitor today.

08:56.349 --> 08:57.300
Have a good day.

09:00.077 --> 09:03.348
See? Everything is going to be fine.

09:03.477 --> 09:04.844
You're my cousin.

09:06.229 --> 09:07.388
Didn't think that through.

09:07.389 --> 09:10.349
You are a very bad influence
on me, you know that?

09:10.589 --> 09:13.221
Am I? I'm sorry.

09:13.557 --> 09:16.484
But if we get into any
trouble, any trouble at all,

09:16.485 --> 09:18.829
I'm going to take full responsibility.

09:19.221 --> 09:20.628
Just like you did with the pot?

09:21.445 --> 09:23.493
Well, like I did eventually.

09:24.109 --> 09:25.917
What the heck, it's summer school.

09:28.869 --> 09:31.053
Oh, hi, Katelyn. Kathleen.

09:32.261 --> 09:33.309
Grace's mom?

09:33.541 --> 09:36.115
Oh, I take it you haven't had
a chance to get my message.

09:36.116 --> 09:37.540
I left you a message last night.

09:37.541 --> 09:38.404
Hi, Kathleen,

09:38.405 --> 09:41.845
and no, I didn't get a
chance to get your message.

09:41.996 --> 09:44.332
And who's this?

09:44.333 --> 09:46.821
This is Jacob, he's a friend of the family.

09:47.163 --> 09:48.117
Am I?

09:49.068 --> 09:50.939
He's visiting with us this summer,

09:50.940 --> 09:53.153
and I was wondering if it was possible to

09:53.154 --> 09:54.435
get him into summer school.

09:54.459 --> 09:56.058
I know classes started weeks ago

09:56.059 --> 09:57.752
but Jacob's very smart,

09:57.753 --> 09:59.353
he's from South Africa.

09:59.568 --> 10:02.817
And he's hoping to go to school
here in the U.S. Permanently.

10:02.977 --> 10:05.008
And is he going to be living with you?

10:05.009 --> 10:07.960
It looks as though he might
be living with me, yes.

10:08.269 --> 10:11.979
But before he commits to that,
and before I commit to that,

10:11.980 --> 10:13.957
I just thought that maybe he
should try summer school.

10:14.766 --> 10:15.948
It's nice to meet you.

10:15.956 --> 10:18.180
You too, I'm Katelyn O'Malley.

10:18.181 --> 10:19.573
Jacob Bowman Gudina.

10:19.877 --> 10:22.533
Oh! Bowman? A cousin?

10:23.004 --> 10:25.244
Ben Boykewich brought his
cousin to school today, too.

10:25.245 --> 10:27.652
I don't know why I never thought

10:27.653 --> 10:29.724
that families don't visit
each other during the summer,

10:29.725 --> 10:32.454
but I guess they do.
I mean, of course they do.

10:32.564 --> 10:33.677
I'm not Grace's cousin.

10:34.661 --> 10:35.573
I'm her brother.

10:37.773 --> 10:42.037
Oh. Well, that's very interesting.

10:42.357 --> 10:45.799
Yes, I'm sure a lot of
people will think so.

10:52.709 --> 10:53.597
What'd I tell you?

10:53.925 --> 10:55.245
He doesn't know he's not at the beach.

10:55.246 --> 10:56.846
Look at him, he's having a great time.

10:56.847 --> 11:00.430
It's 72 degrees and sunny,
no humidity, no sand,

11:00.431 --> 11:01.911
and we got the place to ourselves.

11:02.007 --> 11:03.975
Besides, Robie would
never nap at the beach.

11:04.135 --> 11:06.478
Yeah, I guess it's not that bad.

11:06.584 --> 11:09.125
It's not the ocean, but it
does have certain advantages.

11:09.126 --> 11:10.018
How's Amy doing?

11:10.019 --> 11:11.274
She still jealous her sister got to

11:11.275 --> 11:12.595
go off to Europe with her mom?

11:12.596 --> 11:14.186
Today she's mostly jealous she

11:14.187 --> 11:15.931
didn't get to go to the
beach with John and me,

11:16.043 --> 11:17.388
but maybe it'll make her feel better

11:17.389 --> 11:20.276
when she finds out we didn't go
and we just came here instead.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.292
She's been in a bad mood all summer.

11:22.356 --> 11:24.837
For someone who just got engaged,
she's a real sourpuss.

11:25.548 --> 11:27.989
She's not upset about Anne, is she? Anne?

11:27.990 --> 11:29.294
Her mother. I know that.

11:29.687 --> 11:32.374
I don't think Ashley has any idea.
Any idea about what?

11:32.375 --> 11:34.085
You know what. No, I don't know what.

11:34.086 --> 11:35.477
We've had this conversation before.

11:35.478 --> 11:36.709
What conversation?

11:36.710 --> 11:38.205
The "Anne could be gay" Conversation.

11:38.206 --> 11:39.837
Oh, geez. Did she tell you she's gay

11:39.838 --> 11:41.247
since the last time we talked?

11:41.248 --> 11:43.606
No, she didn't tell me she's
gay, but she and your mother

11:43.607 --> 11:45.172
have cut me out of their
conversations completely,

11:45.173 --> 11:46.543
so what else would they be talking about?

11:47.015 --> 11:47.823
You?

11:48.223 --> 11:49.949
No. They talk about me
right in front of me.

11:49.950 --> 11:52.287
What is your investment in that?
In Anne being gay?

11:52.494 --> 11:53.597
My investment in that is that

11:53.598 --> 11:56.552
there's some reason she's
not with me besides me.

11:56.553 --> 11:58.936
If you're not the guy for her,
then you're not the guy for her.

11:58.937 --> 12:00.432
Go out and get yourself another woman,

12:00.433 --> 12:01.617
a woman who loves you.

12:01.618 --> 12:02.704
You want to be married?

12:02.705 --> 12:04.059
Find someone you want to be married to

12:04.060 --> 12:05.488
who wants to be married to you.

12:06.829 --> 12:08.420
Want me to crank the air?
You getting too hot?

12:08.421 --> 12:11.547
No, this has nothing to do with
the air or the heat or whatever.

12:11.548 --> 12:12.339
I'm fine.

12:12.340 --> 12:13.796
You're really young, you know that?

12:13.876 --> 12:16.243
No woman is going to be interested
in me when she hears my story.

12:16.244 --> 12:18.094
I'm too complicated.

12:18.095 --> 12:19.524
You're not that complicated.

12:19.525 --> 12:20.868
You know what I mean, I have a son.

12:20.869 --> 12:22.941
So? Haven't you ever heard of step-parents?

12:23.007 --> 12:25.901
People get involved with people
who have children all the time.

12:25.939 --> 12:28.179
I'm a grown man who slipped
up with his ex-wife,

12:28.180 --> 12:29.139
I'm not like you and Amy,

12:29.140 --> 12:31.404
I can't blame what happened
on stupidity and hormones.

12:31.405 --> 12:33.395
You and Anne have been going
back and forth for years.

12:33.396 --> 12:34.507
Why don't you do something,

12:34.508 --> 12:36.291
one way or the other, just do something.

12:36.292 --> 12:37.348
I am doing something.

12:37.349 --> 12:38.712
I'm waiting for Anne to
come out of the closet.

12:38.713 --> 12:41.013
And if she doesn't, if
she's not gay, then what?

12:41.357 --> 12:42.477
Then I'm screwed.

12:42.757 --> 12:43.996
I'm screwed anyway.

12:44.092 --> 12:46.036
I'm going to get a popsicle,
you want a popsicle?

12:46.228 --> 12:47.236
Why not?

12:51.066 --> 12:52.737
What happened to family friend?

12:52.738 --> 12:55.337
I thought the plan was to say
you're a friend of the family.

12:55.338 --> 12:59.274
That was the plan, but once
said, it felt like a lie.

12:59.401 --> 13:00.672
You know, some people think that

13:00.673 --> 13:03.609
the intentional omission
of information is lying.

13:03.610 --> 13:05.042
Who's omitted anything?

13:05.474 --> 13:08.353
My mother and I came and met
you and told you who I was

13:08.354 --> 13:10.156
as soon as we found out you were around.

13:10.164 --> 13:11.752
Well, maybe your mother
should have done that

13:11.753 --> 13:14.385
14 years ago when you were born.

13:14.505 --> 13:15.545
What would have happened then?

13:15.546 --> 13:17.672
Then I would have known.
And if you had known?

13:17.673 --> 13:19.073
If I had known,

13:19.074 --> 13:21.438
I certainly wouldn't have stayed
married to Marshall Bowman.

13:21.439 --> 13:24.101
Then you would have missed out
on many years of happiness.

13:24.102 --> 13:25.582
But I wasn't really happy

13:25.938 --> 13:28.138
because I didn't know
about his cheating on me,

13:28.139 --> 13:29.499
and I didn't know about you.

13:29.902 --> 13:31.181
What's the better thing then,

13:31.766 --> 13:34.267
to know everything and be unhappy

13:34.268 --> 13:36.613
or to not know and be happy?

13:36.925 --> 13:38.901
It was not our decision,

13:38.902 --> 13:40.596
my mom's decision or my decision,

13:40.597 --> 13:42.517
it was my father's decision.

13:42.998 --> 13:45.982
This is my decision.

13:46.589 --> 13:49.244
To have you know, to have Tom know,

13:49.245 --> 13:51.477
to have Grace know.

13:51.621 --> 13:54.677
My point was, I would have
liked to have known sooner

13:54.862 --> 13:57.540
because then maybe I would've
have had a shot at being happy

13:57.541 --> 13:59.021
with someone who wasn't raising a child

13:59.022 --> 14:00.806
in another country with another woman.

14:04.393 --> 14:05.341
I'm sorry.

14:06.246 --> 14:07.367
It's probably just the jet lag.

14:07.368 --> 14:09.893
I know that my phoney
marriage was not your fault.

14:09.973 --> 14:10.981
No.

14:11.789 --> 14:12.838
It was not my fault.

14:13.230 --> 14:14.718
It's not usually this hot here.

14:14.773 --> 14:15.965
That's not my fault either.

14:18.534 --> 14:19.438
I'm sorry.

14:19.901 --> 14:20.837
Me, too.

14:26.189 --> 14:27.957
Hey, what's going on?

14:27.990 --> 14:29.775
I just wanted to let you
know that I met Jacob,

14:29.776 --> 14:31.716
and I think we can get him
into school this summer,

14:31.717 --> 14:32.917
but we'll have to see if

14:32.918 --> 14:34.629
he can actually complete any of his courses

14:34.822 --> 14:36.436
with it being such a late start.

14:36.437 --> 14:39.685
Jacob? I don't really know
anything about Jacob.

14:40.054 --> 14:43.669
Jacob who? I don't think that's
really any of my concern.

14:43.958 --> 14:46.534
I just get the feeling that it
might be some of your concern,

14:46.535 --> 14:48.669
to have your brother suddenly
show up at your school.

14:48.670 --> 14:51.109
My what? He's not my brother.

14:51.110 --> 14:52.262
Who told you he's my brother?

14:52.278 --> 14:54.141
He did. He and your mother.

14:54.142 --> 14:56.302
He is not my brother! I am an only child!

14:56.303 --> 14:58.392
Except for Tom! Tom is my brother.

14:58.393 --> 14:59.875
Jacob is not my brother!

14:59.991 --> 15:01.518
We don't even know who he is!

15:03.692 --> 15:04.838
Excuse me. I have to go.

15:06.148 --> 15:08.372
I can't take this stupid heat, okay?

15:10.269 --> 15:11.749
I'll be right back.

15:13.604 --> 15:17.172
Perhaps Ben's cousin could tell
you some more about Chicago.

15:20.684 --> 15:22.347
Does anyone have any questions?

15:22.348 --> 15:25.053
Please. You're not his cousin
and you're not from Chicago.

15:25.116 --> 15:26.484
What's going on with Grace?

15:26.533 --> 15:28.564
And who's this Jacob character?

15:28.573 --> 15:30.211
All of a sudden she has a brother?

15:30.212 --> 15:32.795
It's her brother. It's her half-brother.

15:32.796 --> 15:34.779
Apparently her dad had another child

15:34.780 --> 15:36.348
with some woman that he used to see

15:36.349 --> 15:37.483
when he went back to do

15:37.484 --> 15:39.501
all that volunteer medical work in Africa.

15:43.092 --> 15:44.661
Are you sure, Madison?

15:46.140 --> 15:47.556
Oh, look who's speaking to me.

15:47.804 --> 15:48.891
You know, spreading rumors

15:48.892 --> 15:50.391
about adults is a little different than

15:50.392 --> 15:51.976
spreading rumors about one of us.

15:52.257 --> 15:54.283
It's not a rumor, it's the truth.

15:54.284 --> 15:55.615
Who told you? Jack?

15:55.616 --> 15:58.288
If Jack and I were talking, would
that bother you? Why is that?

15:58.720 --> 16:01.600
Yeah, why is that?
Are you really going out with Jack?

16:01.624 --> 16:03.896
You know he's still in love with Grace.
Don't be an idiot.

16:03.897 --> 16:05.896
Jack and I are just friends,
so who's the idiot?

16:05.977 --> 16:08.353
Let's face it, we're all idiots.

16:08.832 --> 16:10.737
Yes. I'd have to agree.

16:16.672 --> 16:18.791
I'm your best friend.
You could have told me.

16:18.792 --> 16:19.499
I would have told you.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.459
I would have told you if I'd known
he was going to show up here

16:21.460 --> 16:23.403
and tell everybody, I would have told you.

16:23.404 --> 16:25.738
I just... I thought he was going to lie,

16:25.739 --> 16:27.034
I thought my mom was going to lie.

16:27.035 --> 16:29.754
Does she want people to know
that my dad cheated on her?

16:29.755 --> 16:32.139
That he has some child that
he never told her about?

16:34.268 --> 16:37.156
My father never told
anyone about me, Grace.

16:38.308 --> 16:39.740
Not until I showed up.

16:39.853 --> 16:40.922
So what are you saying?

16:40.923 --> 16:43.499
You know how he feels? You're on his side?

16:44.250 --> 16:45.817
What about how I feel about this?

16:45.818 --> 16:47.595
You know what, you're supposed
to be my best friend.

16:47.596 --> 16:49.603
Can you just be my best friend for once?

17:02.098 --> 17:04.223
You know how cool that is?
Being from another continent?

17:04.223 --> 17:06.617
We can use that. We can totally use that.

17:06.913 --> 17:08.071
Use that how?

17:08.073 --> 17:09.683
You stick with me, I'll show you how.

17:09.896 --> 17:13.128
Welcome to America, my
friend, land of opportunity.

17:13.617 --> 17:15.289
Hey, you! Let's take a walk.

17:15.385 --> 17:16.568
Is she talking to you or me?

17:16.569 --> 17:17.896
You. Let's go.

17:18.433 --> 17:20.887
Careful. I don't know if
you're ready for that one.

17:26.065 --> 17:27.009
Grace's brother?

17:28.337 --> 17:29.785
Yeah. I'm Jacob.

17:31.033 --> 17:34.617
Grace's best friend and roommate. Adrian.

17:36.032 --> 17:37.090
We have to talk.

17:37.248 --> 17:39.200
Fine with me. I'm happy talking to anyone.

17:39.297 --> 17:42.473
I'm like you, my father
didn't marry my mother.

17:42.705 --> 17:44.856
Well, not until I was 17, anyway.

17:44.857 --> 17:45.825
Then you're not like me

17:46.049 --> 17:47.520
because my father never married my mother

17:47.521 --> 17:49.441
and he's never going to marry my mother.

17:50.058 --> 17:50.858
He's dead.

17:50.859 --> 17:52.497
Which is no reason to come to America

17:52.498 --> 17:53.811
and torture the Bowmans, okay?

17:54.123 --> 17:55.603
He's just as dead for them.

17:56.987 --> 17:57.739
Look.

17:58.707 --> 18:01.162
People who have the privilege

18:01.163 --> 18:02.386
of growing up in a home

18:02.387 --> 18:05.346
with a mother and a father who are married

18:05.347 --> 18:08.275
don't get that that's not how
it is for a lot of people.

18:08.291 --> 18:09.811
Grace doesn't even get it.

18:09.997 --> 18:12.204
Doesn't mean you can strike out at her.
Because you can't.

18:12.220 --> 18:14.130
I will come after you if you do.
You got that?

18:14.210 --> 18:15.890
And I'm not striking out at anyone,

18:15.891 --> 18:18.897
I'm just curious as to who my
father was and who I really am.

18:18.898 --> 18:20.330
Well, in the process of doing that,

18:20.331 --> 18:22.252
you're making Grace very unhappy.

18:22.331 --> 18:24.107
And that makes me very unhappy.

18:25.235 --> 18:26.795
You don't want to see me unhappy.

18:26.883 --> 18:28.042
Listen to me, woman,

18:28.043 --> 18:30.409
according to Tom, Grace
is always unhappy anyway.

18:30.410 --> 18:34.080
So if you want to talk
to someone, talk to her.

18:36.744 --> 18:38.776
Don't worry about him, he'll make friends.

18:38.992 --> 18:41.120
And you know what, don't worry about Grace.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.480
I mean, she'll get through this.

18:43.417 --> 18:45.425
How about you? Are you okay?

18:46.273 --> 18:47.984
I will be. I guess.

18:47.985 --> 18:50.199
I mean, it's not Jacob's fault,

18:50.200 --> 18:52.479
so I can't really be upset with him.

18:52.480 --> 18:55.255
And well, Marshall is no longer with us

18:55.256 --> 18:56.752
so why be upset with him?

18:56.753 --> 18:58.289
Who's going to benefit from that?

18:59.289 --> 19:00.867
I should have just made things work

19:00.868 --> 19:02.555
with my first husband, you know.

19:02.556 --> 19:04.403
Then I wouldn't have been
trying to make things work out

19:04.404 --> 19:07.316
with my third husband and I
never would have met Jacob.

19:07.804 --> 19:08.836
You know,

19:09.060 --> 19:12.138
I never really had the guts
before to split up with Jeff

19:12.139 --> 19:13.892
but now maybe I do.

19:14.764 --> 19:16.843
I mean, I'm not who I thought I was

19:16.844 --> 19:18.716
and my family is not who
I thought they were.

19:19.739 --> 19:22.227
I thought we were this
upstanding Christian family

19:22.228 --> 19:25.867
but as it turns out, we're just
as screwed up as everyone else.

19:26.404 --> 19:29.524
Which kind of takes the pressure off

19:29.525 --> 19:31.091
trying to be good all the time,

19:31.092 --> 19:33.243
which is a pressure I've
felt my whole my life.

19:36.580 --> 19:39.955
How do you stand it in here?
I think it's a thousand degrees!

19:39.956 --> 19:42.091
Yeah, it gets pretty hot.

19:44.307 --> 19:46.964
It's probably like 70 degrees at the beach.

19:47.156 --> 19:49.700
Would you just shut up about the beach?

19:49.860 --> 19:52.068
We can't go to the beach, get over it.

19:52.069 --> 19:53.795
I can't help it, Lauren,

19:53.796 --> 19:55.796
we're supposed to be having fun this summer

19:55.989 --> 19:57.866
and it's all going by so quickly,

19:57.867 --> 19:59.459
and we're not having any fun at all.

20:00.431 --> 20:02.416
I don't even know if I
know how to have fun.

20:02.417 --> 20:04.284
My family's not any fun.

20:04.584 --> 20:05.843
And you think being the

20:05.844 --> 20:08.412
daughter of two shrinks
is a picnic in the park?

20:09.234 --> 20:11.814
You know what, I'm going to
do something about this.

20:11.815 --> 20:12.933
I'm going to get happy.

20:12.934 --> 20:14.454
How are you going to do that?

20:14.710 --> 20:16.676
I don't know, but I'll figure it out

20:16.677 --> 20:18.134
and I'm going to do something.

20:18.135 --> 20:21.033
Yeah, well, do something about
this heat while you're at it.

20:21.440 --> 20:23.014
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

20:31.536 --> 20:32.593
There you are.

20:32.594 --> 20:33.901
You changed?

20:33.902 --> 20:34.766
Yeah, we changed.

20:34.767 --> 20:37.086
We wore our poor clothes to blend

20:37.087 --> 20:38.374
but now we're leaving and our

20:38.375 --> 20:40.143
poor clothes are sweaty,
so yes, we changed.

20:40.144 --> 20:42.164
It's really hot in here.

20:42.657 --> 20:45.992
But thank you for giving us a
glimpse into public school.

20:45.993 --> 20:48.010
Yes, it was very revealing.

20:48.022 --> 20:49.909
Your dad makes you go here?

20:49.910 --> 20:52.173
Well, no, my dad doesn't make me go here,

20:52.174 --> 20:55.457
but my two best friends
were going here, so...

20:55.623 --> 20:57.351
I mean, it's a good school.

20:57.916 --> 21:00.186
A good school would have air conditioning.

21:01.165 --> 21:02.276
Bye.

21:04.921 --> 21:07.100
So you're still happy we came, right?

21:07.131 --> 21:09.081
I'm happy any time I get to see you.

21:09.082 --> 21:12.226
Yeah, and this time, no
one got into any trouble.

21:12.227 --> 21:15.159
Well, no one got into any trouble yet.

21:15.406 --> 21:18.406
Did you want to kiss me goodbye?

21:28.789 --> 21:30.803
Bye, Cousin Ben. Goodbye.

21:31.795 --> 21:34.116
Maybe I'm having a heat stroke.

21:42.839 --> 21:44.720
Hi. Hi, Henry.

21:44.733 --> 21:45.916
So are you seeing Jack again?

21:45.917 --> 21:47.683
That's how you knew about Grace's brother?

21:47.684 --> 21:50.071
No, Grant keeps calling me from med camp,

21:50.072 --> 21:51.638
he's been talking to Jack.

21:52.073 --> 21:53.417
I miss Jack.

21:53.882 --> 21:55.423
And I miss Amy and Lauren.

21:55.987 --> 21:57.939
I really miss Amy and
Lauren more than Jack.

21:57.940 --> 21:59.948
Yeah, I miss Ben more than Alice.

22:00.430 --> 22:03.995
But I miss Alice, too.
I miss having friends.

22:04.568 --> 22:05.649
And maybe you were right,

22:05.650 --> 22:08.071
maybe the two of us need
each other right now.

22:08.850 --> 22:11.319
You want to go some place air conditioned

22:11.320 --> 22:13.515
and grab some coffee or
something after school?

22:13.516 --> 22:14.748
I'd love that.

22:32.550 --> 22:34.833
Hey! What are you doing here?
Is everything okay?

22:34.834 --> 22:37.381
Everything is fine. Your dad called,

22:37.418 --> 22:39.627
he wanted us to go to the beach
with him and Robie, so...

22:39.628 --> 22:43.344
Oh, no. So you went to the
Juergens' indoor beach.

22:43.345 --> 22:45.107
Yeah. He hates sand.

22:45.108 --> 22:46.672
He pretty much hates everything.

22:46.673 --> 22:48.576
Yeah. He used to do that
whole indoor beach thing

22:48.577 --> 22:50.038
with us all the time when we were little.

22:50.039 --> 22:51.345
No wonder I'm so warped.

22:51.346 --> 22:52.772
You are warped.

22:52.893 --> 22:53.998
Are you still upset with me?

22:53.999 --> 22:55.516
Why? Because you and John

22:55.517 --> 22:58.129
are out having a good
time again while I'm not?

22:58.238 --> 22:59.305
No.

23:00.538 --> 23:03.214
I can't help it. Maybe I can help it.

23:03.458 --> 23:05.910
Your dad is going to keep John
while we go out for dinner.

23:05.911 --> 23:06.928
I want to take you out to dinner.

23:06.929 --> 23:08.400
That way you can have some fun, too.

23:08.401 --> 23:10.998
Don't take me out to dinner,
that's not going to help anything.

23:11.488 --> 23:13.725
I'm just not that much fun,
I'm not a fun person,

23:13.726 --> 23:15.344
and it's too hot. I don't want to eat.

23:15.345 --> 23:17.472
You really suck at being
happy, you know that?

23:17.473 --> 23:19.164
Actually, I do know that.

23:21.300 --> 23:23.558
You got a little sweat
on the top of your lip.

23:23.559 --> 23:25.419
Hmm, I'm not surprised.

23:25.420 --> 23:27.973
It's really hot in here
in the summer, isn't it?

23:28.382 --> 23:30.645
Enjoy summer school. I'll see you tonight

23:30.646 --> 23:32.613
and I'm going to make you happy.

23:36.084 --> 23:37.230
I doubt it.

23:46.061 --> 23:47.949
Betty? Nora?

23:48.180 --> 23:51.317
Yeah. Nice to meet you finally.

23:51.318 --> 23:53.210
How'd you know who I am?

23:53.433 --> 23:55.422
Oh, I'd know you anywhere.

23:55.423 --> 23:58.364
I've seen some of the
pictures around the office.

23:58.902 --> 24:00.524
And I was expecting you.

24:00.525 --> 24:04.935
Still, I mean, I'm just so
surprised you recognized me.

24:04.936 --> 24:07.096
These are my new school clothes.

24:07.514 --> 24:09.682
You know, I've had to
change my entire wardrobe,

24:09.683 --> 24:12.137
you know, so I could fit in.

24:12.547 --> 24:16.806
My counselor is helping me with
that, with the fitting in.

24:16.807 --> 24:18.949
Well, you do look different.

24:19.163 --> 24:22.633
Um, you look, um, younger.

24:22.702 --> 24:25.160
Oh! And smarter.

24:25.952 --> 24:28.986
Speaking of which, I have
your tuition check for you.

24:28.987 --> 24:31.696
Oh, thank you, Nora. Yeah.

24:31.697 --> 24:34.299
And please thank Leo for me. Will do.

24:34.300 --> 24:37.370
Leo really loves that air
conditioner, doesn't he?

24:37.371 --> 24:39.226
Yes, he really does.

24:40.411 --> 24:42.158
Oh, you know, Betty,

24:42.577 --> 24:44.745
if you don't mind my asking,
I was just wondering,

24:44.746 --> 24:47.850
what did you decided to major in?
Just out of curiosity.

24:47.851 --> 24:51.945
Oh. It's called Anthropology.

24:51.946 --> 24:53.781
And it's the study of man.

24:53.782 --> 24:57.082
Uh-huh! Yeah, good choice.

24:57.182 --> 24:58.798
I bet you'll do well with that.

24:58.799 --> 25:00.959
Oh, I hope so.

25:01.511 --> 25:04.268
I mean, I don't really
know what I want to do,

25:04.269 --> 25:07.176
you know, I just want to study something,

25:07.177 --> 25:10.012
even if I have to change
my major, like, later on.

25:10.450 --> 25:12.737
I love that college lingo.

25:12.905 --> 25:14.636
"My major."

25:15.382 --> 25:17.426
Oh, I really am excited.

25:17.427 --> 25:19.958
That's something I've
always wanted to do but...

25:21.721 --> 25:23.416
I don't think I could do
at this point in my life.

25:23.417 --> 25:25.257
Well, you could if you wanted to.

25:25.258 --> 25:28.136
Leo would let you off work, I'm sure of it.

25:28.137 --> 25:31.094
No, I'm just not the college type.

25:31.277 --> 25:33.665
There is no type.

25:34.336 --> 25:36.070
You could do it.

25:36.832 --> 25:38.466
You should do it.

25:38.467 --> 25:40.106
Think about it, Nora,

25:40.107 --> 25:42.328
think about going back to school.

25:42.575 --> 25:44.529
Obama wants you to.

25:44.530 --> 25:45.970
And if you want to do it,

25:45.971 --> 25:48.309
then maybe you and I could
share a dorm room together.

25:48.310 --> 25:49.395
Wouldn't that be fun?

25:49.396 --> 25:51.742
Well, actually, I think it
would be a little too close

25:51.743 --> 25:53.065
to what my last place was,

25:53.066 --> 25:56.423
but I will keep it in mind. Thanks, Betty.

25:56.424 --> 25:58.063
Think about it.

25:58.319 --> 26:01.091
All right. Well, take care.

26:16.001 --> 26:16.845
Thank you very much.

26:16.846 --> 26:19.325
I just didn't want to get
involved in a conversation

26:19.326 --> 26:21.234
when I've got this guy coming up here.

26:21.235 --> 26:23.133
No problem, just doing my job.

26:24.292 --> 26:26.211
What's with the coat?

26:26.246 --> 26:28.397
My fingers were getting numb.

26:28.877 --> 26:30.190
You know, if you want to...

26:30.191 --> 26:32.879
No, I don't. I don't want to go to college.

26:32.880 --> 26:35.288
Sorry, didn't mean to offend you, you know,

26:35.289 --> 26:39.324
I didn't go to college myself.
And I've done pretty well.

26:39.325 --> 26:40.215
On the other hand...

26:40.216 --> 26:42.431
Can you leave it, all right?

26:43.555 --> 26:45.749
You're too hot in the
coat, that's the problem.

26:45.750 --> 26:47.697
Heat makes people cranky.

26:47.765 --> 26:51.563
Everyone thinks better in cold air.
It's a proven fact.

26:55.100 --> 26:56.827
Leo. Robert.

26:56.828 --> 26:57.959
Pudding Pop.

26:59.417 --> 27:01.351
I told her. Well, great.

27:01.352 --> 27:03.242
It's a term of endearment.

27:03.711 --> 27:05.296
I may not be King of anything,

27:05.297 --> 27:07.858
but I run a successful business.

27:07.872 --> 27:09.435
I know you do, I checked it out.

27:09.436 --> 27:12.758
Well, good, I checked out your
sausage business as well.

27:12.759 --> 27:16.421
Good for you.
Look, all I really want to say is this.

27:16.422 --> 27:18.455
No guy is going to be good
enough for your daughter,

27:18.456 --> 27:21.652
and no girl is going to be
good enough for my son.

27:21.847 --> 27:23.321
So why don't we just call a truce

27:23.322 --> 27:25.637
and let the two of them
make their own decisions?

27:25.638 --> 27:27.718
I came down here in a heat wave

27:27.719 --> 27:28.978
to hear that my daughter

27:28.979 --> 27:31.211
should be allowed to go out with your son?

27:31.563 --> 27:33.352
You don't get to make that decision.

27:33.450 --> 27:35.122
It is freezing in here.

27:35.123 --> 27:37.227
Yeah. Feels good, doesn't it?

27:37.617 --> 27:39.267
I didn't decide anything.

27:39.268 --> 27:41.759
I just said they should
make their own decisions

27:41.760 --> 27:44.100
and I was just hoping that you'd
go along with me on that,

27:44.101 --> 27:45.446
you and your wife.

27:45.740 --> 27:46.676
I thought about it

27:46.677 --> 27:49.761
and at this point, I think we can see

27:49.762 --> 27:51.765
that they're determined to see each other

27:51.766 --> 27:54.082
and they're going to find
a way to see each other.

27:54.329 --> 27:56.975
Oh, no, they're not, not if I
have anything to do with it.

27:56.976 --> 27:59.469
Well, apparently, you don't
have anything to do with it.

27:59.470 --> 28:02.978
Dylan and her friends have been
at school with Ben all day.

28:03.025 --> 28:05.655
He called me, he told me.

28:05.656 --> 28:07.229
Could I get you a jacket?

28:08.658 --> 28:10.678
All day? I'm afraid so.

28:15.224 --> 28:17.360
It is really cold in here.

28:17.911 --> 28:20.920
But it's nice.

28:21.054 --> 28:22.601
It's even colder in my office.

28:22.602 --> 28:24.079
Really? Come on.

28:24.080 --> 28:27.172
It's just that I want Dylan to be happy.

28:27.758 --> 28:30.201
Her mother and I want her to be happy.

28:30.286 --> 28:33.073
It's just we don't want
her happy and pregnant.

28:33.074 --> 28:34.241
I hear you.

28:41.240 --> 28:42.711
Oh.

28:43.224 --> 28:45.169
All I'm saying is, don't dig your heels in

28:45.170 --> 28:47.465
before you even hear what he has to say.

28:47.505 --> 28:50.001
He is your brother and you don't
really even know him enough

28:50.002 --> 28:52.389
to know if he's a good guy or
whether you like him or not.

28:52.390 --> 28:53.562
Yes, I do know.

28:53.563 --> 28:55.212
That I don't like him at all.

28:55.213 --> 28:56.298
And you can't expect me to like him,

28:56.299 --> 28:57.761
he just shows up here out of nowhere

28:57.762 --> 29:00.865
and completely destroys our
family and our reputation.

29:02.236 --> 29:03.448
What is that look?

29:03.973 --> 29:06.394
Everybody knew my dad was
an upstanding citizen

29:06.395 --> 29:08.823
and we were a strong,
upstanding Christian family.

29:08.824 --> 29:10.229
Now we all look like a bunch of idiots

29:10.230 --> 29:12.208
and he looks like some pervert.

29:12.551 --> 29:14.320
I was actually looking at you.

29:14.321 --> 29:15.883
Are you sure you should be walking around

29:15.884 --> 29:16.774
like that if we're just friends?

29:16.775 --> 29:18.706
I don't know where the thermostat is.

29:18.938 --> 29:22.348
Okay, well, is that what you think?

29:22.389 --> 29:24.209
That you and your family look like idiots?

29:24.210 --> 29:26.094
What do you mean is that what I think?
Yes, that's what I think.

29:26.095 --> 29:27.886
I just said that's what I think.

29:27.887 --> 29:31.223
But your dad would be more of
a philanderer than a pervert.

29:31.224 --> 29:32.667
Whatever!

29:33.093 --> 29:35.063
People thought my dad was a saint.

29:35.064 --> 29:36.761
I thought my dad was a saint.

29:36.944 --> 29:38.608
I can't believe he was
telling us not to have sex

29:38.609 --> 29:40.820
when he was having sex with
someone other than my mother.

29:41.136 --> 29:42.570
No one's a saint.

29:42.696 --> 29:44.545
No one thought your father was a saint,

29:44.546 --> 29:47.509
they thought he was a good
man and he was a good man.

29:47.510 --> 29:49.303
Well, he obviously wasn't.

29:49.442 --> 29:51.214
We thought he was but he wasn't.

29:52.639 --> 29:54.817
I cannot believe Jacob would do this to us.

29:54.818 --> 29:56.504
I mean, how does this happen?

29:56.609 --> 29:58.824
You know how this happens. It just happens.

29:58.825 --> 30:01.562
And when it happens, it's
certainly not the kid's fault.

30:01.607 --> 30:04.093
This isn't Jacob's fault,
he's innocent in all this.

30:04.094 --> 30:06.123
Innocent? He's not innocent.

30:06.124 --> 30:07.423
He came here to ruin our lives,

30:07.424 --> 30:09.169
the way his life had been ruined.

30:09.170 --> 30:11.699
I'm not so sure his life has been ruined.

30:11.700 --> 30:13.419
He seems like a pretty confident guy

30:13.420 --> 30:14.893
and he comes from a really nice family.

30:14.894 --> 30:16.490
Yeah, my family!

30:16.491 --> 30:19.063
I meant he and his mother
have a very nice life.

30:19.064 --> 30:21.347
He's not trying to take
anything away from you.

30:21.348 --> 30:23.933
Well, he did. He took away my dignity.

30:23.934 --> 30:26.164
Well, it's kind of hard to
have any kind of dignity

30:26.165 --> 30:27.596
when you're dressed like that.

30:27.597 --> 30:29.508
Not that you don't look
good like that, but...

30:29.509 --> 30:30.903
But stop looking.

30:31.358 --> 30:32.526
Okay.

30:34.752 --> 30:35.579
Hi.

30:35.580 --> 30:37.474
Did you tell Jack to come over here?

30:37.610 --> 30:40.034
No. No. -- Yes, you did. Your mother did.

30:40.035 --> 30:41.525
Your mother asked me to talk to you.

30:41.526 --> 30:43.984
Okay, so you talked to me.
You can leave now.

30:43.985 --> 30:47.366
Yeah, you can leave now. I've got this.

30:48.373 --> 30:50.116
All right, well, if you
need to talk to anybody,

30:50.117 --> 30:51.702
Grace, you know how to reach me.

30:51.916 --> 30:53.221
I'm just trying to be a friend.

30:53.222 --> 30:54.907
Well, if you like Jacob,
and you're on his side,

30:54.908 --> 30:56.342
then you are not my friend.

31:05.894 --> 31:07.286
I talked to Jacob.

31:07.512 --> 31:08.545
And?

31:09.050 --> 31:11.941
Jacob can't help it if his mother
had an affair with your dad.

31:12.057 --> 31:14.533
You're too late.
Jack already gave me this lecture.

31:14.534 --> 31:16.962
And he can help coming here,
he did not have to come here.

31:16.963 --> 31:19.789
No, he didn't have to,
Grace, but he wanted to.

31:19.790 --> 31:21.569
Just like I wanted to meet my dad.

31:21.828 --> 31:23.674
You helped me meet my dad,

31:23.675 --> 31:25.723
why don't you help him
get to know your dad?

31:25.747 --> 31:28.324
Because I don't even know my dad!
So why should he?

31:28.747 --> 31:31.399
Okay, neither of you really
knew everything about him,

31:31.400 --> 31:33.548
but if the two of you
get to know each other

31:33.549 --> 31:36.103
and in doing that, you'll get
to know more about your father.

31:36.552 --> 31:38.264
And before you say anything,

31:38.566 --> 31:41.721
look, maybe you'll find out some stuff

31:41.722 --> 31:43.868
that you won't be that happy about,

31:43.869 --> 31:46.022
but maybe there's other

31:46.023 --> 31:48.228
stuff that you'll be really happy to know.

31:49.220 --> 31:51.194
Adrian, if this happened to
you, you'd go after this guy,

31:51.195 --> 31:53.375
and you'd seek revenge,
just like you always do.

31:53.376 --> 31:56.090
You're probably right. But you're not me.

31:56.226 --> 31:57.485
You're better than me.

31:58.139 --> 32:00.484
That's why I wanted you
to be my best friend.

32:00.485 --> 32:02.242
I'm so not better than you.

32:02.243 --> 32:03.892
Well, not right now, no.

32:04.467 --> 32:05.953
I'm just kidding.

32:06.964 --> 32:08.286
Don't you feel better?

32:08.889 --> 32:10.554
Just a little bit better?

32:12.451 --> 32:14.795
Okay, we really need to find
out where that thermostat is.

32:20.399 --> 32:23.919
Go on. Do it. You know you want to.

32:24.026 --> 32:26.794
I want to, I'm just not sure
if it's going to do any good.

32:26.795 --> 32:28.595
Just call her.

32:29.077 --> 32:30.063
Okay.

32:39.049 --> 32:40.062
Madison?

32:40.063 --> 32:42.414
Oh, hi, Lauren.

32:42.415 --> 32:45.517
I'm surprised you took my call, thank you.

32:45.518 --> 32:48.546
I actually was thinking about calling you,

32:48.557 --> 32:50.086
I called Jesse.

32:50.142 --> 32:51.201
You did?

32:51.202 --> 32:54.401
Yeah, I told him the same
thing I want to tell you.

32:54.402 --> 32:55.735
What was that?

32:55.736 --> 32:58.564
Madison, I'm really tired of being angry

32:58.565 --> 33:02.063
with Jesse and with you about
what happened at that party.

33:03.136 --> 33:05.571
You are? Yeah, I am.

33:05.749 --> 33:09.321
Neither of you are bad people,
you just did a bad thing.

33:09.324 --> 33:11.725
And it doesn't feel good
to be angry for this long,

33:11.726 --> 33:14.090
it's making me really unhappy,

33:14.223 --> 33:17.104
so I just want to let go of all that.

33:17.261 --> 33:19.266
And I'm going to forget

33:19.267 --> 33:21.515
about what happened just
like you asked me to.

33:21.516 --> 33:23.164
You are? Really?

33:23.333 --> 33:24.385
Really.

33:24.810 --> 33:28.659
But what I can't do, Madison,
is still be best friends.

33:28.660 --> 33:30.640
And I don't say that out of anger,

33:30.641 --> 33:32.930
it's just the truth.

33:33.018 --> 33:36.662
I guess sometimes relationships
change and it's no one's fault

33:36.663 --> 33:38.259
and no one's to blame.

33:38.368 --> 33:40.967
So I hope we can both move on

33:40.986 --> 33:44.841
and coexist peacefully in the
same school our senior year.

33:44.842 --> 33:46.704
So you're basically just

33:46.705 --> 33:49.394
breaking up with me and
Jesse for a second time?

33:49.826 --> 33:52.428
If that's the way you want
to look at it, I guess so.

33:52.429 --> 33:56.442
But I'd like to look at it
more as I'm letting go.

33:56.443 --> 33:58.393
I just want to let go and move on

33:58.394 --> 34:01.112
and hopefully that will make me happier.

34:01.113 --> 34:03.600
And you too, Madison, I
hope you'll be happier

34:03.601 --> 34:05.671
knowing that I'm not angry with you.

34:08.934 --> 34:09.784
Whatever.

34:09.786 --> 34:10.790
So?

34:11.424 --> 34:13.810
So she's not angry with me anymore,

34:13.811 --> 34:16.092
she's just letting go of our friendship.

34:16.094 --> 34:18.706
Oh.
Yeah. Oh.

34:21.734 --> 34:25.074
So, want to call Alice?

34:25.194 --> 34:27.639
No, I think it's better I don't.

34:27.706 --> 34:30.710
Uh, Ben? Try Ben.

34:39.232 --> 34:40.719
He's not picking up.

34:41.721 --> 34:44.023
He's not going to pick up.

34:55.324 --> 34:56.406
We wouldn't have sex with each other

34:56.525 --> 34:58.961
just to get back at Lauren and
Ben for breaking up with us

34:59.081 --> 35:02.126
because we had sex with
people they love, would we?

35:02.424 --> 35:03.582
That would be really stupid, wouldn't it?

35:03.702 --> 35:05.606
Yeah.

35:05.726 --> 35:07.162
I don't need someone else
to sleep with, Madison,

35:07.229 --> 35:09.397
I really just need a friend.

35:09.464 --> 35:12.300
All right. Yeah, me, too.

35:12.367 --> 35:15.480
Besides, it's so hot out.
I'm all sweaty and everything.

35:15.600 --> 35:18.106
Sweat kind of turns me on.

35:18.173 --> 35:19.274
I like sweat.

35:19.341 --> 35:24.422
I like hot, sweaty, dirty

35:25.141 --> 35:27.349
friendships.

35:27.415 --> 35:30.352
So why don't you tell me
something about yourself

35:30.418 --> 35:33.355
that has nothing to do with sex.

35:33.421 --> 35:37.579
Like, I don't know, about Japanese people.

35:37.699 --> 35:39.578
I'm not Japanese, I'm Filipino.

35:39.698 --> 35:42.264
Wow. Like that.

35:42.330 --> 35:44.032
So is it hot where you're from?

35:44.099 --> 35:45.233
I'm from here.

35:45.300 --> 35:46.334
Oh, wow. Me, too.

35:47.829 --> 35:50.238
Don't tell me you're
actually doing homework.

35:50.305 --> 35:51.498
I thought this was summer school.

35:51.618 --> 35:53.038
I thought you didn't have any homework.

35:53.564 --> 35:55.118
Turns out Dylan and her friends

35:55.238 --> 35:57.615
are a little competitive
on the academic side,

35:57.735 --> 36:00.057
so I was just doing some studying
on my own, not homework.

36:00.177 --> 36:02.687
Ah, so there could be something
good about the relationship,

36:02.807 --> 36:04.929
if she inspires you to
learn a little something.

36:07.188 --> 36:09.987
Did you talk to her dad?

36:10.463 --> 36:14.196
I talked to him. He came down to the
office and we talked to each other.

36:14.316 --> 36:15.261
And?

36:15.511 --> 36:20.097
And here's the deal, for you anyway.

36:20.335 --> 36:23.371
You want to make your own
decisions about who you date,

36:23.438 --> 36:24.740
make your own decisions.

36:24.860 --> 36:26.731
You want to go out with
Dylan, go out with Dylan.

36:26.851 --> 36:28.515
I know there's a catch to this.

36:28.635 --> 36:30.312
There is a catch to this.

36:30.378 --> 36:32.523
You're responsible for
anything that happens.

36:32.643 --> 36:33.608
And I'm not.

36:34.196 --> 36:37.372
If you and Miss Dylan get into
any trouble from this point on,

36:37.509 --> 36:39.478
I'm not bailing you out.

36:39.544 --> 36:41.034
If you go and wreck the car,

36:41.154 --> 36:43.008
you buy a new one if and when you can.

36:43.459 --> 36:46.581
I'm not replacing or fixing any car you
damage when you're out with Dylan.

36:46.752 --> 36:49.454
You get busted for
drinking or anything else,

36:49.521 --> 36:52.624
you get your own attorney
and you pay for him or her.

36:52.691 --> 36:56.084
And if you get this girl
pregnant, you figure it out,

36:56.309 --> 36:59.039
there's not going to be any help
from me if that happens again.

36:59.265 --> 37:01.566
That's it?
That's it.

37:01.633 --> 37:03.769
So before you pick up that
phone and make a date,

37:03.835 --> 37:05.637
you better think about it.

37:05.704 --> 37:08.640
Because as attracted as
you are to this girl,

37:09.857 --> 37:12.908
this time you may want to make
your decisions with your head,

37:13.028 --> 37:14.680
not your heart, or any
other part of your body

37:14.746 --> 37:16.448
if you know what I'm talking about.

37:16.515 --> 37:17.549
Okay.

37:19.651 --> 37:22.045
I can tell you're making a decision
without thinking about it.

37:22.165 --> 37:24.901
I'm asking you to think
about it until tomorrow.

37:24.968 --> 37:27.213
If you call her, call her tomorrow.

37:28.004 --> 37:29.072
Okay.

37:29.139 --> 37:31.007
I promise. I'll wait until tomorrow.

37:31.074 --> 37:32.976
And if she calls you tonight?

37:33.043 --> 37:35.946
Dad, come on, I'd have to talk to her.

37:36.012 --> 37:40.050
I love you, Ben, and I meant
every word that I said.

37:40.117 --> 37:42.145
If you loved me, you'd turn off the air.

37:58.014 --> 37:59.850
I'm not sure I get it.

37:59.916 --> 38:01.088
Get what?

38:01.208 --> 38:03.662
I'm sure you wanted to come
back here for a reason.

38:03.782 --> 38:07.723
I did. This is where we first met.
I thought it'd be fun.

38:07.855 --> 38:09.857
To come back to the scene of the crime?

38:09.924 --> 38:11.826
Neither of us really had
a good time, did we?

38:14.028 --> 38:18.032
Yeah, we did. The sex wasn't
great but we had a good time.

38:18.099 --> 38:19.901
I can't believe we did what we did.

38:19.967 --> 38:21.903
I mean, I was hardly 15.

38:21.969 --> 38:24.772
Yeah, I really shouldn't
have even approached you.

38:24.839 --> 38:27.842
But that was me, that
was me three years ago.

38:27.909 --> 38:30.745
You've changed a lot in three years.

38:30.811 --> 38:32.046
So have you.
I don't think so.

38:32.113 --> 38:34.048
You don't want to think so.

38:34.115 --> 38:36.717
I was hoping if we could
take a look at the past

38:36.784 --> 38:38.853
then maybe we could kind of
move ahead with the future.

38:38.920 --> 38:40.133
What do you mean?

38:40.253 --> 38:42.037
I mean, I think we ought
to take a little time

38:42.157 --> 38:45.228
to think about all the hell we went
through over the past three years

38:45.348 --> 38:47.795
and appreciate where we are right now

38:47.862 --> 38:50.516
so we can start enjoying life together.

38:50.898 --> 38:54.902
We kind of have been through a lot.

38:54.969 --> 38:57.492
You had a baby in high school.

38:57.612 --> 39:00.486
And you stayed in school and you're
going to graduate and go to college.

39:00.606 --> 39:02.159
That's huge, Amy, it really is.

39:02.777 --> 39:03.749
I guess.

39:04.225 --> 39:06.781
Come on, Amy, there's a
reason you're so determined

39:06.847 --> 39:07.949
to have some fun this summer.

39:08.015 --> 39:10.718
You haven't had any fun any
summer since I met you

39:10.785 --> 39:13.821
other than here and that
lasted about two seconds.

39:16.023 --> 39:19.077
I so thought sex was going to be
like how it is in the movies.

39:19.197 --> 39:20.761
It wasn't,

39:20.828 --> 39:21.996
but I hope it's a little better now.

39:22.063 --> 39:23.898
More than a little.

39:23.965 --> 39:26.834
See? Things have changed, things
have changed for the better.

39:26.901 --> 39:28.936
The trouble that started here is over,

39:29.003 --> 39:30.838
a bad thing became a good thing,

39:30.905 --> 39:32.907
it became you and me and John.

39:32.974 --> 39:33.874
Yeah.

39:33.941 --> 39:36.874
I guess it could have
gone a lot differently.

39:36.994 --> 39:38.998
It could have been worse
than just losing the time

39:39.118 --> 39:40.915
I had to be a teenager to being a mother.

39:42.850 --> 39:44.264
Oh, my God, did I just say that?

39:44.384 --> 39:45.720
That sounds horrible.

39:45.786 --> 39:47.963
Yeah, but it's true, that is what happened.

39:48.083 --> 39:51.092
And I can't get the past three
years back for you, Amy,

39:51.158 --> 39:53.498
but I'm going to do my best
to make the rest of our lives

39:53.618 --> 39:55.796
as happy and as much fun as I can.

39:55.863 --> 39:57.473
I don't want either of us to live in that

39:57.593 --> 39:59.700
could-have-been, should-have-been world.

39:59.767 --> 40:01.869
We can still have a good
life together, with John.

40:01.936 --> 40:03.647
Even if you are in summer school.

40:04.048 --> 40:06.807
I was feeling really good about myself

40:06.927 --> 40:10.011
after you proposed to me, like I won.

40:10.077 --> 40:13.080
I got through all the hard stuff

40:13.147 --> 40:17.517
and all that was over and I
was victorious or something.

40:17.985 --> 40:20.855
Then that kind of all went away

40:20.922 --> 40:22.990
and I felt as if nothing had changed

40:23.057 --> 40:26.027
other than I had this ring on my finger

40:26.093 --> 40:30.279
and I just wanted to go back
and get everything I missed.

40:30.399 --> 40:31.799
Yeah, I know.

40:31.866 --> 40:33.868
I used to want to get my life back,

40:33.935 --> 40:37.553
get back the years from like three to 13.

40:37.972 --> 40:39.840
And when my life did get better,

40:39.907 --> 40:41.872
I still hung on to wanting
my childhood back.

40:42.123 --> 40:44.812
Eventually I realized I
wasn't going to get that

40:44.879 --> 40:47.144
and when I realized that, then
life started getting better

40:47.264 --> 40:48.998
and I got a little happier
one day at a time.

40:49.118 --> 40:51.819
I love it when you talk to me like this.

40:51.886 --> 40:54.789
Are you sure that you're not
trying to have sex with me?

40:54.855 --> 40:56.420
I didn't even bring a condom.

40:57.510 --> 40:58.512
I did.

40:59.760 --> 41:02.460
What? It is band camp.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.003
It's funny you called me, I hadn't
set the beach up for years.

41:09.070 --> 41:13.007
No, I actually thought
you might since it's so hot out.

41:13.074 --> 41:14.809
The whole thing was your idea, wasn't it?

41:15.943 --> 41:17.812
Was it? I don't remember.

41:17.878 --> 41:20.781
You wanted to wear a bathing suit
but you didn't want to get any sun.

41:20.848 --> 41:23.368
That's right.

41:24.852 --> 41:27.402
So, Marshall has a kid, huh?

41:27.522 --> 41:28.789
Yeah.

41:29.827 --> 41:32.132
I don't know what's more shocking.

41:32.420 --> 41:35.248
That or that Anne is gay.

41:35.368 --> 41:36.634
Could be.

41:38.111 --> 41:48.411
