WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:07.041
Hey, Dad. How was your day?

00:07.125 --> 00:08.667
Do you really wanna know?

00:08.750 --> 00:10.333
Actually, I was just being polite.

00:11.750 --> 00:14.166
It was horrible!

00:14.250 --> 00:16.959
Oh, good. So you're gonna tell me anyway.

00:18.375 --> 00:21.667
Toby kept me awake all night,
so I was a zombie all day.

00:21.750 --> 00:24.333
You know, I was so tired,

00:24.417 --> 00:27.125
I used termite spray
on a nest full of rats.

00:28.667 --> 00:30.625
Well, you'll, uh...

00:30.709 --> 00:32.667
You'll kill them tomorrow, huh, Dad?

00:35.166 --> 00:36.667
I never know what to say.

00:39.083 --> 00:40.750
Oh, no. You know what?

00:40.834 --> 00:42.542
- I think I'm just gonna lay down
- Oh, okay.

00:42.625 --> 00:43.834
right here.

00:43.917 --> 00:45.333
Oh, yeah.

00:45.375 --> 00:47.083
Toby, come on.

00:47.166 --> 00:48.750
Work with me here.

00:48.834 --> 00:51.166
Oh, please. Help a mother out.

00:52.709 --> 00:54.041
Guess who missed his nap?

00:57.917 --> 01:00.208
And guess who took an extra-long one?

01:08.583 --> 01:09.542
Check it out.

01:09.625 --> 01:11.125
I just joined the marching band.

01:13.125 --> 01:15.125
Gabe! Gabe! Gabe!

01:15.208 --> 01:17.166
- What?
- Take it outside.

01:18.166 --> 01:20.083
No, Mrs. Dabney just told me
to take it inside.

01:21.375 --> 01:23.291
Honey? Honey?

01:23.417 --> 01:24.291
Here's some Mail for PJ.

01:24.375 --> 01:26.208
Maybe you could take it
to his apartment tomorrow?

01:28.000 --> 01:30.250
- How about If I do it now?
- Amy: Okay.

01:39.667 --> 01:41.041
This is so great.

01:41.125 --> 01:42.667

Hey, thanks for coming
to my volleyball game.

02:42.166 --> 02:44.125
Oh, yeah. My pleasure.

02:44.208 --> 02:48.959
Getting to see all those cute guys
running around in tight shirts and shorts.

02:49.959 --> 02:51.750
But mostly you. I focused on you.

02:52.667 --> 02:54.250
Well, it was An awesome game.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.500
I'm telling you, the team's
really coming together this year.

02:56.583 --> 02:57.500
Yeah?

02:57.583 --> 02:59.750
Yeah, it must be really fun to be
a part of a team.

03:00.709 --> 03:01.834
You know what's kinda sad?

03:02.375 --> 03:04.208
This is my last year of high school,

03:04.250 --> 03:05.959
and I've never played a sport.

03:06.041 --> 03:07.125
Oh, well.

03:09.542 --> 03:10.625
You know what?

03:11.458 --> 03:13.250
I'll join the girls' volleyball team.

03:13.333 --> 03:14.709
You're gonna play volleyball?

03:14.792 --> 03:15.917
Look, it's not that easy.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.125
Well, how hard could it be?

03:17.250 --> 03:18.458
You do it.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.709
It's very difficult, all right?

03:21.792 --> 03:22.959
I just make it look easy.

03:23.041 --> 03:24.583
Kind of like being your boyfriend.

03:32.333 --> 03:33.166
Oh, oh!

03:33.959 --> 03:35.709
Oh, yes!

03:35.792 --> 03:37.542
All day long!

03:37.667 --> 03:38.500
I got it.

03:40.208 --> 03:42.375
- Hey.
- Hey, Dad.

03:42.458 --> 03:45.083
Welcome to casa de PJ and Emmett.

03:45.583 --> 03:48.709
What? Wait, I thought we were calling it
"Emmett and PJ's World o' Fun"?

03:48.792 --> 03:52.375
So, what brings you to our place
to be named later?

03:53.625 --> 03:54.792
I brought you some mail.

03:55.458 --> 03:57.458
Bob: Hey! You got chairs.

03:59.792 --> 04:02.375
Oh, yeah.

04:02.458 --> 04:06.166
Quite the change from casa de
drums and screaming kids.

04:08.041 --> 04:09.542
Oh, let's go with "World o' Fun,"

04:09.625 --> 04:11.166
They're already using "casa de."

04:12.291 --> 04:14.291
You know, it's not always
this quiet here, Mr. Duncan.

04:14.375 --> 04:16.125
Uh, we're right next door
to a fire station,

04:16.208 --> 04:17.333
so we get a lot of sirens.

04:17.417 --> 04:21.083
So, does a siren go off every hour
of the night 'cause it's hungry?

04:22.917 --> 04:26.458
Siren need to be burped and changed?

04:28.625 --> 04:30.375
You don't know a lot about sirens, do you?

04:32.125 --> 04:35.250
Well, Dad, um, thanks for stopping by.

04:35.625 --> 04:37.500
It, uh--

04:37.583 --> 04:38.709
Dad?

04:42.542 --> 04:43.750
I think he's asleep.

04:44.417 --> 04:45.625
And he's sitting on the remote.

04:45.709 --> 04:47.792
So, how are we gonna change the channel?

04:49.083 --> 04:50.375
I got an idea.

04:50.917 --> 04:52.041
Uh...

04:52.750 --> 04:54.375
It worked.

04:54.458 --> 04:55.333
Okay.

04:56.542 --> 04:57.458
Wait, wait, wait. Go back.

04:57.542 --> 04:58.542
Oh. Um.

04:59.083 --> 05:00.000
Ah.

05:00.083 --> 05:01.792
- Perfect.
- Okay.

05:03.333 --> 05:04.792
Now how are we gonna turn up the volume?

05:08.125 --> 05:09.333
- Volume's fine.
- Yup.

05:16.542 --> 05:18.166
Hey, Mom?

05:18.250 --> 05:20.125
I need some help with my science project.

05:20.959 --> 05:22.166
Where's Dad?

05:25.208 --> 05:27.250
Uh, hello?

05:29.500 --> 05:30.709
Why don't you want my help?

05:33.417 --> 05:35.709
Come on, Gabe. I'm great at science.

05:35.792 --> 05:37.250
And it sounds like fun.

05:37.333 --> 05:39.625
Helping me
with a science project sounds fun?

05:40.166 --> 05:41.875
I'm covered in spit-up.
Work with me, here.

05:44.583 --> 05:46.166
All right.

05:46.250 --> 05:47.250
I'll give you a shot.

05:47.375 --> 05:48.458
Great.

05:48.542 --> 05:50.125
And, uh, just so we're clear,

05:50.208 --> 05:51.250
I'm not gonna let you trick me

05:51.375 --> 05:53.000
into doing all the work
like you do with dad.

05:54.542 --> 05:57.709
For your information,
Dad enjoys being tricked.

05:59.500 --> 06:01.000
It's part of the dance we do.

06:03.125 --> 06:04.542
All right, what's the project?

06:05.125 --> 06:08.917
Building a model rocket
to launch at the science fair.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.959
- Ooh. Fun.
- Gabe: Yeah.

06:11.041 --> 06:13.125
- When's it due?
- Two days.

06:13.208 --> 06:14.625
Two days?

06:15.542 --> 06:17.250
Why did you wait till the last minute?

06:17.333 --> 06:19.291
Well, that's when Dad does his best work.

06:20.542 --> 06:21.917
That's true.

06:28.792 --> 06:29.834
Listen up, everybody.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.500
I want you to meet
the newest member of our team.

06:32.583 --> 06:34.333
Hi, everybody. I'm Teddy.

06:34.417 --> 06:35.250
Wrong.

06:36.792 --> 06:38.458
No, I'm pretty sure.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.542
Teddy's too soft.

06:40.625 --> 06:41.667
It's too nice.

06:41.750 --> 06:44.834
From now on,
Your volleyball name is, uh...

06:44.917 --> 06:46.583
It's T-rex!

06:46.667 --> 06:49.166
Keep stretching.
I'm gonna get a fresh whistle.

06:52.709 --> 06:56.041
Coach likes to give us all
fierce dinosaur nicknames

06:56.125 --> 06:57.875
that go with the first letter of our name.

06:58.750 --> 07:01.166
I'm Vonnie, so I'm "Velociraptor,"

07:01.250 --> 07:02.750
Stephanie's "Stegosaurus,"

07:02.834 --> 07:04.166
Taylor's "Pterodactyl."

07:04.250 --> 07:05.750
But pterodactyl begins with a "p."

07:05.834 --> 07:08.500
Tell it to the coach.

07:08.583 --> 07:09.834
He loves to be corrected.

07:13.208 --> 07:15.625
All right, get to work.

07:22.792 --> 07:24.333
I'm sorry,
I thought you were gonna get that.

07:31.667 --> 07:32.959
Way to go. Nice shot.

07:33.041 --> 07:34.500
That was awesome.

07:42.792 --> 07:44.625
Oh, are you okay?

07:47.917 --> 07:49.208
That was mine, wasn't it?

07:50.417 --> 07:52.625
That's it.

07:52.709 --> 07:54.125
Practice is over.

07:54.208 --> 07:55.792
Mr. Hammerstone: Except for you, T-rex.

07:55.875 --> 07:57.125
I want to talk to you in private.

07:58.458 --> 07:59.583
You stink.

08:00.709 --> 08:03.166
Coach, I don't think we're in private yet.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.959
And do you know why you stink?

08:05.041 --> 08:07.166
- No.
- When I ask a question,

08:07.250 --> 08:09.000
I don't want an answer,
do you understand me?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.166
I don't know what to do.

08:13.583 --> 08:14.667
You're too nice.

08:14.750 --> 08:16.417
Nice people, they get pushed around.

08:16.542 --> 08:19.250
And I'm not talking about volleyball,
I'm talking about life.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.583
It's just my first day.

08:20.709 --> 08:22.375
And possibly your last.

08:23.083 --> 08:25.458
Now, if you want to stay on my team,

08:25.542 --> 08:27.583
you need to come back tomorrow
and play with some fire.

08:27.667 --> 08:29.083
- You got it?
- Got it.

08:29.750 --> 08:31.208
Oh, and one more thing.

08:31.250 --> 08:33.333
Pterodactyl actually starts with a "p."

08:33.458 --> 08:34.834
I know that it's kind of confusing,

08:34.917 --> 08:36.500
- but it's--
- Get out of here!

08:42.041 --> 08:43.458
See? Isn't this nice?

08:43.542 --> 08:45.041
Working on a project together.

08:45.291 --> 08:47.834
Nice? It's great.

08:47.917 --> 08:49.375
It doesn't even feel like homework.

08:49.458 --> 08:51.417
It's more like, home play, or...

08:52.333 --> 08:53.667
home joy, or...

08:55.125 --> 08:56.250
Too much?

08:57.625 --> 08:58.709
Okay.

09:01.125 --> 09:02.834
Hey, Charlie. What do you want?

09:04.250 --> 09:05.291
Oh.

09:06.083 --> 09:07.208
I forgot,

09:07.250 --> 09:09.917
I totally promised Charlie
I was gonna play with her.

09:11.959 --> 09:13.500
Charlie,

09:13.583 --> 09:15.375
I'm sorry I can't play with you.

09:16.709 --> 09:20.083
Look, I know you've been feeling neglected
ever since Toby came along,

09:20.166 --> 09:24.375
but I'm working on
a big school project with Mom.

09:27.166 --> 09:28.625
Oh, you know,

09:28.709 --> 09:31.000
go play with her for a few minutes.

09:31.083 --> 09:32.417
I'll just get this started.

09:32.959 --> 09:34.166
If you say so.

09:39.583 --> 09:40.917
Where's my toy?

09:44.792 --> 09:46.250
Just like we talked about.

09:46.333 --> 09:47.458
Thank you.

09:47.542 --> 09:50.125
All right, now,
let's head down to the basement

09:50.208 --> 09:51.792
where you're gonna play "sit quietly,"

09:51.875 --> 09:53.875
while I play "watch TV."

10:00.125 --> 10:01.083
And then,

10:01.166 --> 10:04.709
he said that i stink because I'm too nice.

10:06.792 --> 10:08.083
You know, this is all your fault.

10:08.166 --> 10:09.250
How is it my fault?

10:09.417 --> 10:10.875
You're the one who wanted to join a team.

10:10.959 --> 10:14.041
Well, you could have mentioned
that the coach was a lunatic.

10:15.709 --> 10:17.417
You know what? I don't need this.

10:17.500 --> 10:18.417
I'm gonna quit.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.000
Well, I thought you wanted
to play a sport.

10:20.083 --> 10:22.000
Yeah, well there's plenty
of other sports out there.

10:22.083 --> 10:23.917
I'll do the one with the, um,

10:24.000 --> 10:26.500
with the ball, and the stick,
and the helmet.

10:27.667 --> 10:30.458
Okay, so that would be either

10:30.542 --> 10:33.417
softball, field hockey, or lacrosse.

10:35.333 --> 10:37.208
- Which one's outdoors?
- All of them are.

10:37.250 --> 10:38.792
Which one has the cutest uniforms?

10:38.875 --> 10:39.709
None of them do.

10:39.792 --> 10:42.208
Sports is so hard.

10:51.750 --> 10:54.208
- Gentlemen.
- Hey, Dad.

10:55.125 --> 10:56.208
What are you doing here?

10:56.291 --> 10:57.458
Again?

10:58.291 --> 10:59.375
Oh, I, uh...

10:59.458 --> 11:01.583
brought you a little housewarming gift.

11:01.667 --> 11:02.792
Vacuum bags.

11:05.917 --> 11:07.709
That will come in handy.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.000
Once we get a vacuum.

11:11.250 --> 11:13.500
Well, Dad, it was nice of you to...

11:13.583 --> 11:15.458
Take off your coat And stay.

11:16.750 --> 11:18.250
I also brought

11:18.875 --> 11:21.250
this awesome Japanese monster movie.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.458
Your mom hates it
when I watch these at home.

11:24.542 --> 11:25.917
Bob: Put it in the thing.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.250
Um...

11:27.333 --> 11:30.125
You know, actually, Dad,
we're kind of busy.

11:30.208 --> 11:32.625
That's all right. Don't worry about it.
You're not gonna bother me.

11:37.125 --> 11:39.959
Just another peaceful day in Tokyo, huh?

11:42.208 --> 11:44.166
Oh, that's gonna change.

12:02.792 --> 12:04.125
Teddy?

12:04.208 --> 12:05.709
Why are you getting home
from work so late?

12:06.959 --> 12:09.834
Well, I had a very stressful day
at the library.

12:09.917 --> 12:11.750
One of the patrons was talking,

12:11.834 --> 12:14.375
and I was gonna say something,
but I didn't want to be mean.

12:15.125 --> 12:16.667
Then my boss got mad at me,

12:16.792 --> 12:19.000
so I hid in the stacks and cried.

12:21.500 --> 12:24.792
Teddy, you gotta stop letting people
walk all over you.

12:24.875 --> 12:25.750
Yeah.

12:25.834 --> 12:27.166
Now, what are you standing there for?

12:27.250 --> 12:28.542
Get in the kitchen and make dinner.

12:28.625 --> 12:29.583
Yes, sir.

12:29.667 --> 12:31.375
Get the door first.

12:35.125 --> 12:37.375
- Mr. Hammerstone?
- Look at you.

12:37.458 --> 12:38.583
Because you quit the team,

12:38.667 --> 12:40.667
people walked all over you
the rest of your life.

12:40.750 --> 12:43.417
I told you so. I told you so.
I told you so.

12:43.500 --> 12:44.542
Can I use your bathroom?

12:44.625 --> 12:46.041
- Sure.
- I told you so.

12:46.125 --> 12:48.083
I told you so. I told you so.

12:48.166 --> 12:50.083
I told you so. I told you so.

12:53.458 --> 12:54.458
That's it.

12:54.542 --> 12:55.917
I am done being nice.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
- ♪ Gumdrops and lollipops... ♪
- Aww.

13:00.500 --> 13:01.792
No!

13:09.834 --> 13:11.625
Hey, honey. How'd you sleep?

13:12.250 --> 13:13.208
Lousy.

13:13.291 --> 13:15.583
And if that doesn't sound nice,
then too bad.

13:18.417 --> 13:20.041
Well, someone's in a mood.

13:21.750 --> 13:23.208
Got a problem with that?

13:24.083 --> 13:25.917
Um, Teddy, sweetheart.

13:26.542 --> 13:28.750
Um, are you okay? 'Cause you just seem,

13:28.834 --> 13:31.000
I don't know, completely different?

13:32.792 --> 13:33.792
What?

13:33.875 --> 13:35.166
Do you want some of this?

13:38.583 --> 13:39.834
Come again?

13:42.500 --> 13:45.709
Well, whether or not you want it,

13:46.417 --> 13:48.166
I'm not going to give it to you.

13:52.375 --> 13:53.625
That's what I thought.

13:55.375 --> 13:56.917
Gabe, honey?

13:57.625 --> 13:59.792
I'm gonna say something to you
I have never said before.

14:00.375 --> 14:02.500
Right now, you're my favorite.

14:07.583 --> 14:08.625
Feels good.

14:10.333 --> 14:11.542
Don't get used to it.

14:20.250 --> 14:21.291
Hey.

14:21.375 --> 14:22.458
Dad.

14:22.542 --> 14:24.208
How did you get in here?

14:26.250 --> 14:27.709
Locksmith let me in.

14:28.166 --> 14:30.667
He let you into our apartment
without our permission?

14:30.750 --> 14:32.709
Locksmiths and exterminators are brothers.

14:34.083 --> 14:36.333
Yeah, we're like cops and firefighters.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.792
Just a little less heroic.

14:40.375 --> 14:42.458
Hey, you know what? I got you a present.

14:45.542 --> 14:47.250
And you're welcome.

14:48.125 --> 14:49.250
A vacuum cleaner.

14:50.208 --> 14:51.458
Yay.

14:52.583 --> 14:53.959
Uh, so...

14:54.041 --> 14:55.417
Dad, um,

14:55.500 --> 14:57.208
how much longer Are you--

14:57.291 --> 14:59.000
Oh. Wait.

14:59.083 --> 15:00.166
Pizza's ready.

15:02.417 --> 15:03.458
You've gotta get rid of him.

15:03.542 --> 15:05.542
Don't worry. He, he won't stay long.

15:05.625 --> 15:07.917
You know what? I was thinking about
getting you guys a sofa bed.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.792
You know, so that when I'm here late

15:09.875 --> 15:11.000
and you want me to stay over?

15:13.333 --> 15:14.625
Now.

15:16.166 --> 15:17.417
I have an idea.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.709
So, he likes it here
'cause it's quiet, right?

15:19.792 --> 15:21.083
- Right.
- Watch this.

15:21.166 --> 15:22.375
- Hey, Dad?
- Bob: Yeah?

15:22.458 --> 15:24.583
Mind if I take the new vacuum
for a little test run?

15:24.667 --> 15:25.625
Go ahead.

15:25.709 --> 15:26.709
Okay.

15:32.041 --> 15:33.750
Just my luck. The shush vac.

15:41.166 --> 15:42.709
Um, PJ? What are you doing?

15:44.792 --> 15:46.417
What? PJ?

15:47.583 --> 15:49.500
PJ. PJ!

15:51.709 --> 15:52.792
Yes, Dad?

15:55.875 --> 15:56.709
What are you doing?

15:56.792 --> 15:58.291
Well, i just don't feel like I'm cleaning

15:58.417 --> 15:59.333
unless i hear that sound.

16:02.625 --> 16:04.333
Is that bothering you?

16:04.375 --> 16:07.709
No. Still quieter than home.

16:19.333 --> 16:20.250
Ah.

16:22.125 --> 16:23.417
Mom.

16:23.959 --> 16:25.792
What did you do to my rocket?

16:26.375 --> 16:29.375
Well, uh, first, I built it.

16:29.458 --> 16:32.000
And then I made it pretty.

16:34.083 --> 16:35.667
Feathers? Why'd you have to add feathers?

16:35.750 --> 16:37.542
Oh, that was Charlie's special touch.

16:38.417 --> 16:39.667
We also named it.

16:39.750 --> 16:40.834
Say hello...

16:40.875 --> 16:42.750
To "Rainbow Sunshine."

16:44.875 --> 16:46.250
I can't take that to school.

16:46.625 --> 16:49.792
Well, i guess you could
always redecorate it yourself.

16:50.750 --> 16:52.000
You mean...

16:52.250 --> 16:53.500
Work on my own project?

16:56.166 --> 16:57.834
Has it really come to that?

16:58.375 --> 16:59.500
I'm afraid so.

17:00.208 --> 17:01.291
It was a good run.

17:10.583 --> 17:11.792
Duncan.

17:11.875 --> 17:13.250
I didn't think you'd come back.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.500
Did you sleep on what I said?

17:14.583 --> 17:18.458
Oh, I slept on it, dreamt it,
chewed it up, and spit it out.

17:20.083 --> 17:21.834
All right, dinos, listen up.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.959
We're gonna scrimmage
the boys' team today.

17:24.041 --> 17:25.041
Yeah!

17:25.166 --> 17:27.375
Whatever scrimmage means, bring it!

17:32.709 --> 17:34.083
I thought you were quitting.

17:34.166 --> 17:35.709
What? You're trying to get in my head?

17:35.792 --> 17:38.208
Are you afraid to lose
to a bunch of girls?

17:41.000 --> 17:42.375
You trash talk your boyfriend?

17:42.458 --> 17:44.000
I'm so gonna do that.

17:44.083 --> 17:45.917
As soon as I learn how to trash talk.

17:46.542 --> 17:47.542
And get a boyfriend.

17:47.625 --> 17:48.750
Okay.

17:53.375 --> 17:54.625
Got lucky, punks.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.166
Oh, sweetums! Oh.

18:09.041 --> 18:10.166
I think you broke my nose.

18:10.875 --> 18:12.625
Mr. Hammerstone:
T-rex, let me get in there.

18:12.709 --> 18:14.458
Oh!

18:15.417 --> 18:17.583
Oh, my nose!

18:18.041 --> 18:19.792
Mr. Hammerstone: She broke my nose too.

18:20.417 --> 18:22.041
Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't--

18:22.125 --> 18:23.208
It was an accident.

18:23.250 --> 18:24.458
They were both accidents.

18:24.542 --> 18:27.625
Sweet mother, I created a monster!

18:27.709 --> 18:29.250
No. Guys, come on.

18:29.333 --> 18:30.500
I'm not a monster.

18:30.583 --> 18:32.000
Teddy: I'm not a monster.

18:42.417 --> 18:44.750
Does anyone know
when field hockey try-outs are?

18:52.250 --> 18:53.083
All right.

18:53.875 --> 18:54.709
All right.

18:55.375 --> 18:56.875
All right, I'm done!

18:59.458 --> 19:01.208
Come on.

19:01.250 --> 19:02.792
- Wow.
- What do you think?

19:03.333 --> 19:04.875
You ruined it.

19:06.417 --> 19:08.583
Rainbow sunshine Is now

19:08.667 --> 19:12.500
"Black Night Doom Missile
of Terror Fireball."

19:13.667 --> 19:15.000
All right, let's do a test launch.

19:15.083 --> 19:18.500
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa. Before you do,
I've prepared a few words.

19:18.583 --> 19:19.583
Oh, boy.

19:19.667 --> 19:20.917
Amy: Okay.

19:22.375 --> 19:24.291
"From the beginning of time,

19:24.375 --> 19:27.083
man looked to the heavens and said,

19:27.166 --> 19:30.959
'Stupid birds!
How come they get to fly and we don't?'"

19:32.291 --> 19:33.583
- I'm pushing the button.
- No, no, no!

19:33.667 --> 19:35.583
I haven't gotten to my favorite part.
Wait, wait, wait.

19:35.667 --> 19:37.834
Three, two, one.

19:37.917 --> 19:38.792
Blast off.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.250
Yeah, that's some fireball.

19:49.333 --> 19:50.667
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:50.750 --> 19:51.792
What are you doing out here?

19:51.875 --> 19:53.208
Uh, we need to talk.

19:53.375 --> 19:54.959
Okay, but can we do it over at your place?

19:55.041 --> 19:56.208
'Cause I'm way more comfortable
over there.

19:56.291 --> 19:57.500
Actually...

19:59.041 --> 20:00.750
Actually, let's do it here.

20:00.834 --> 20:02.959
- Okay?
- Okay.

20:08.125 --> 20:09.333
Wow, this is really hard.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.834
I don't really know how to do this.

20:12.333 --> 20:14.875
Well, PJ, if it's hard to say,

20:14.959 --> 20:16.959
just say it fast.

20:17.041 --> 20:19.166
It's like, like tearing off a bandage.

20:20.250 --> 20:21.208
All right.

20:22.000 --> 20:22.875
Here goes.

20:24.792 --> 20:26.208
I-don't-want-you-to-hangout
at-my-place-so-much.

20:29.500 --> 20:32.000
You might want to tear that
a little slower.

20:34.333 --> 20:35.625
I...

20:37.667 --> 20:39.917
- Don't...
- Little, little, little faster.

20:42.125 --> 20:44.375
I don't want you to hang out
at my place so much.

20:46.583 --> 20:47.417
Look, I'm sorry, Dad.

20:47.500 --> 20:50.125
But I moved out of the house
so I could be on my own.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.041
Kind of hard to do that
when you're always there.

20:55.875 --> 20:57.083
I see.

20:57.959 --> 20:59.083
You mad at me?

20:59.667 --> 21:00.709
No.

21:00.792 --> 21:02.250
- Okay.
- No.

21:02.959 --> 21:04.333
No, come on, you're absolutely right.

21:04.417 --> 21:05.250
It's your place.

21:05.959 --> 21:08.834
You know, you don't want your old man
hanging out there all the time.

21:09.333 --> 21:10.375
No, I do not.

21:11.291 --> 21:12.750
I mean, I mean...

21:13.834 --> 21:15.041
Thanks for understanding.

21:17.750 --> 21:19.875
Oh, I'm gonna miss your place.

21:24.417 --> 21:25.959
'Cause let me tell you something.

21:26.041 --> 21:26.959
Around here?

21:28.333 --> 21:30.417
It always feels like
there's something crazy going on.

21:31.750 --> 21:32.917
Oh.

21:33.041 --> 21:34.542
Mom, I think I found the problem.

21:34.625 --> 21:36.125
Loose wires.

21:36.208 --> 21:37.041
Well, dude.

21:37.125 --> 21:38.166
Stick 'em together.

21:45.208 --> 21:47.500
- Was that a rocket?
- Yup.

21:49.375 --> 21:50.875
Come over any time, Dad.

21:50.959 --> 21:52.250
- How about now?
- Let's go.

21:57.458 --> 21:58.792
Hey, Charlie.

21:58.917 --> 22:00.542
So, big news.

22:00.625 --> 22:03.166
Looks like I'm staying
on the volleyball team.

22:05.834 --> 22:08.959
You know, after they make
a few minor repairs to the gym.

22:10.709 --> 22:12.792
Speaking of minor repairs.

22:16.583 --> 22:18.333
Teddy: So this is what happens

22:18.375 --> 22:20.875
if you let Mom help you
with a school project.

22:21.417 --> 22:23.000
Okay, it was not my fault.

22:24.500 --> 22:27.458
Really? Because Gabe said
you uttered the words,

22:27.542 --> 22:29.250
"Dude, stick 'em together."

22:31.500 --> 22:33.834
I don't recall exactly what I uttered.

22:35.625 --> 22:37.500
Okay. Well, consider yourself warned.

22:37.583 --> 22:41.000
If you ever allow Mom to help you
with a science project...

22:41.083 --> 22:42.917
Good luck, Charlie.

22:51.041 --> 22:52.417
Fly, rocket.

22:53.542 --> 22:55.875
Fly high.

22:57.375 --> 22:59.125
Hey, hon.

22:59.208 --> 23:00.333
Bob?

23:00.375 --> 23:02.583
What are you doing here?

23:02.667 --> 23:04.667
Oh, PJ and Emmett kicked me out.

23:04.750 --> 23:07.000
So I'm just looking for
a little peace and quiet.

23:08.250 --> 23:09.709
Well, you're crowding me.

23:09.792 --> 23:10.792
Get lost.

23:10.875 --> 23:13.333
I'm crowding you? In outer space?

23:14.208 --> 23:16.333
Oh, would you just leave?

23:16.417 --> 23:17.500
Honey, I'm floating.

23:17.583 --> 23:19.250
It's not like I can steer the chair.

23:19.750 --> 23:22.583
Oh, well let me help you out.

23:22.667 --> 23:24.834
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

23:26.583 --> 23:28.667
Fly chair.

23:28.750 --> 23:30.917
Fly high!
