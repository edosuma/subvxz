FAR AWAY ISLAND.

05:44.345 --> 05:47.215
A KIND-HEARTED KING
MELTED DOWN HIS CROWN

05:47.223 --> 05:48.932
AND SHAPED IT INTO A MEDALLION

05:48.933 --> 05:51.518
WITH A SPECIAL
STONE IN THE MIDDLE.

05:51.519 --> 05:53.559
THE KING DID THIS
TO SHOW HIS PEOPLE

05:53.563 --> 05:55.897
THAT EVERYBODY WAS IMPORTANT,

05:55.898 --> 05:59.488
AND THAT NO ONE PERSON WAS
BORN GREATER THAN ANOTHER.

THE MEDALLION TOOK
ON SPECIAL POWERS,

06:04.615 --> 06:08.945

THE PURE IN HEART.

06:08.953 --> 06:10.662
WITH THIS POWERFUL MEDALLION,

06:10.663 --> 06:16.043
THE KING USED IT TO GROW CROPS
FROM BARREN SOIL.

06:16.044 --> 06:21.590
HE SAVED HIS PEOPLE
FROM DEADLY STORMS.

06:21.591 --> 06:23.550

PROTECTED HIS VILLAGE

INVADING ARMIES.

PRIDEFUL SON, HUKO,

06:36.356 --> 06:39.396
TOOK THE MEDALLION
AND LOST THE STONE,

06:39.400 --> 06:41.440
CAUSING IT TO LOSE
ITS POWER.

06:46.157 --> 06:48.327
WITHOUT THE POWER OF THE
STONE TO PROTECT THE ISLAND,

06:48.328 --> 06:52.786
THE EVIL WARLORD COBRA,
CONQUERED THE PEACEFUL PEOPLE.

06:55.541 --> 06:57.838
BUT JUST BEFORE HE
SEIZED THE MEDALLION,

06:57.839 --> 07:00.335

DON'T EVER FORGET
THAT GOD LOVES YOU,

01:32:19.202 --> 01:32:21.122
MORE THAN YOU
COULD EVER KNOW.

01:32:32.423 --> 01:32:34.183
THANK YOU, DANIEL.
THAT WAS QUITE A STORY.

01:32:34.184 --> 01:32:36.545
WHERE DID YOU GET IT?

01:32:36.552 --> 01:32:39.602
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I JUST
MADE IT UP AS I WENT ALONG.

01:32:39.603 --> 01:32:41.427
WELL IT WAS PERFECT.

01:32:41.432 --> 01:32:43.682
I JUST HATE THAT YOU
MISSED YOUR GAME, THOUGH.

01:32:43.684 --> 01:32:46.520
I DON'T.

01:32:46.521 --> 01:32:48.651
THIS DID MORE FOR ME
THAN ANY GAME EVER COULD.

01:32:57.156 --> 01:33:01.576
DON'T EVER GIVE UP
ON THEM.

01:33:01.577 --> 01:33:02.577
I NEVER GAVE UP ON YOU,

01:33:02.578 --> 01:33:04.118
DID I DANNY,
WHEN YOU WERE HERE?

01:33:10.753 --> 01:33:13.797
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

01:33:13.798 --> 01:33:17.717
DON'T STAY AWAY
SO LONG OKAY?

01:33:17.718 --> 01:33:21.388
IF MS. JESSIE EVER CAN'T
MAKE IT TUESDAY, CALL ME.

01:33:21.389 --> 01:33:22.389
OK.

01:33:32.942 --> 01:33:35.819
THANK YOU FOR LOVING ME
ALL THOSE YEARS.

01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:39.370
ISN'T THAT WHY
WE'RE HERE?
