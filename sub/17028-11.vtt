00:01.628 --> 00:03.097
Previously on 2 Broke Girls...

00:03.098 --> 00:05.929
The hurricane is headed
right for Williamsburg.

00:05.930 --> 00:08.096
Fedoras are blowing down the streets,

00:08.098 --> 00:09.698
craft beers are spilling everywhere,

00:09.699 --> 00:12.835
and indie bands are cancelling practice.

00:16.439 --> 00:18.407
This explains why Randy isn't here yet.

00:18.408 --> 00:20.275
He's probably stuck in the store.

00:20.276 --> 00:23.278
He's not answering and it's
going straight to voicemail.

00:23.279 --> 00:25.214
He probably blocked you.

00:25.215 --> 00:27.783
We're really broken up.

00:27.784 --> 00:29.184
Let's go hug our dessert bar.

00:29.185 --> 00:31.620
It was probably so scared.

00:31.621 --> 00:34.056
Oh, my God, Max.

00:34.057 --> 00:36.425
Our dessert bar is destroyed.

00:36.426 --> 00:39.261
I think we have to finally
admit it to ourselves.

00:39.262 --> 00:40.762
Ugh, we're cursed.

00:43.199 --> 00:44.766
Yeah, this is personal.

00:44.767 --> 00:47.936
Come on, when that gypsy
pointed at me in first grade

00:47.937 --> 00:50.806
and said, "Biggus
Boobus," that was a curse.

00:50.807 --> 00:52.875
I'm sure we weren't the only business

00:52.876 --> 00:54.209
that was ruined by the storm.

00:54.210 --> 00:55.777
We're not cursed.

00:56.980 --> 01:01.016
Yeah, now it's starting to burn.

01:01.017 --> 01:04.253
Well, I am choosing to take
this disaster as a sign.

01:04.254 --> 01:06.655
It's not like we don't have insurance.

01:06.656 --> 01:08.423
And while they're rebuilding this place,

01:08.424 --> 01:11.560
I'm gonna go surprise
Randy and try to rebuild us.

01:11.561 --> 01:13.428
You see the parallels?

01:13.429 --> 01:16.265
You get it. She gets it.

01:16.266 --> 01:18.233
Girls, did you hear?

01:18.234 --> 01:21.036
Turns out only one
business in the entire area

01:21.037 --> 01:22.604
was affected by the storm.

01:22.605 --> 01:24.640
I wonder which one...

01:24.641 --> 01:27.209
Oh.

01:27.210 --> 01:30.746
File this under "Story
For Another Time"?

01:36.219 --> 01:38.787
Biggus Boobus!

01:54.693 --> 01:56.516
Ugh, I don't believe this!

01:56.517 --> 01:58.484
All the airports are more shut down

01:58.485 --> 02:00.119
than I am emotionally.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.655
Earl, have you had any luck
with any busses or trains?

02:02.656 --> 02:03.990
I'm on it.

02:03.991 --> 02:07.160
What button do I push for the Internet?

02:07.161 --> 02:08.895
I just talked to the insurance company.

02:08.895 --> 02:10.896
They're gonna pay for all our repairs.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.298
And they gave me some extra money

02:12.299 --> 02:14.234
'cause I told them we were pregnant.

02:14.235 --> 02:16.936
Can we please focus on
how I'm gonna get to L.A.?

02:16.937 --> 02:19.138
I have low self-esteem
and a well-viewed sex tape.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.474
I should be there already!

02:21.475 --> 02:24.177
Max, I'm gonna try to
put this delicately.

02:24.178 --> 02:27.714
You're acting like a
cray-cray psycho stalker.

02:27.715 --> 02:29.082
I am not a stalker.

02:29.083 --> 02:30.550
I'm the one that gets stalked.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.385
That reminds me, I
should probably tell Gary

02:32.386 --> 02:33.620
I'm going out of town.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.321
Oh, he knows.

02:35.322 --> 02:38.291
He left a bon voyage dookie on
our welcome mat this morning.

02:38.292 --> 02:40.860
But the card was sweet.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.929
Well, then as your best friend,

02:42.930 --> 02:45.431
I am going with you to
make sure you're okay.

02:45.432 --> 02:47.333
You know, Randy did give
me an airline voucher

02:47.334 --> 02:49.369
when I ruined our
relationship the first time.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.037
I could probably get
two tickets for that,

02:51.038 --> 02:53.172
so I could put my feet up.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.408
Or I guess you could come.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.844
If I'm the wing-lady on
your stalking mission,

02:57.845 --> 03:00.413
I'm gonna go ahead and
call this a vacation.

03:00.414 --> 03:02.148
Wow, that's sad.

03:02.149 --> 03:04.951
All right, I'm almost on the Internet.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.786
Does anybody know my password?

03:06.787 --> 03:08.488
It's "Earl."

03:08.489 --> 03:12.424
Oh, right, my first dog's name.

03:14.560 --> 03:16.828
Hey, everybody!

03:19.599 --> 03:21.622
I just got in a fight with
one of Barbara's friends

03:21.623 --> 03:23.136
in the IKEA ball pit.

03:23.137 --> 03:26.139
Yeah, if you're gonna
bring meatballs in there,

03:26.140 --> 03:28.541
you gotta bring some for everybody.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.544
Yeah, there's never enough
meatballs in a ball pit.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.913
Earl, how we doing on our trip to L.A.?

03:33.914 --> 03:35.882
Well, the rental cars are rented out,

03:35.883 --> 03:38.851
trains are down, and
no flights till Tuesday.

03:38.852 --> 03:42.120
And I got a message
from emoji. Who's emoji?

03:43.356 --> 03:46.359
Hey, why don't you
two just road trip it?

03:46.360 --> 03:48.761
You know, throw a cooler of beer

03:48.762 --> 03:52.398
with pulled pork in the
trunk and just go, baby.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.667
I would do the same if I didn't have

03:54.668 --> 03:57.203
that giant breastfeeding baby.

03:57.204 --> 03:59.271
I'm talking about Oleg.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.242
May I suggest the Toyota
Yaris I sold to Han?

04:03.243 --> 04:04.877
It's efficient on gas,

04:04.878 --> 04:07.647
and the trunk can't be
unlocked from the inside.

04:07.648 --> 04:10.183
Oh, no! You're not taking my car.

04:10.184 --> 04:12.352
It's my turn to drive my quilting group

04:12.353 --> 04:13.986
to the farmers' market.

04:13.987 --> 04:16.356
Han, we can do this the hard way

04:16.357 --> 04:18.620
where you don't give me the
keys and I give you a wedgie,

04:18.620 --> 04:20.625
or the easy way where
you do give me the keys

04:20.627 --> 04:22.762
and I give you a slightly
less intense wedgie.

04:22.763 --> 04:25.264
The keys are in my
office, but you're not...

04:25.265 --> 04:28.267
Oh, dear, I've said too much.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.002
Who do you see winning this one?

04:30.003 --> 04:32.505
And you should know, Max
keeps a pocket full of sand

04:32.506 --> 04:34.907
for these kinda things.

04:34.908 --> 04:37.076
Jingle-jangle, bitches!

04:37.077 --> 04:40.113
You should be fired for
what happened back there.

04:40.114 --> 04:42.982
Bathing suit areas are off limits.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.817
Fine, use my car,

04:44.818 --> 04:46.719
but I'm going to be driving it.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.388
I'm coming with you.

04:48.389 --> 04:51.324
I finally got the gas pedal
extension where I like it.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.459
But who's gonna run the diner?

04:53.460 --> 04:57.830
FYI, I managed a pretty
successful jerk shack for years.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.632
Ew, Oleg.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.667
What? Get your mind out of the gutter.

05:01.668 --> 05:03.636
We sold Jamaican-style chicken.

05:03.637 --> 05:07.607
As a front for full-release massages.

05:07.608 --> 05:10.843
Y'all, what was my
first dog's name again?

05:10.844 --> 05:13.146
- Earl.
- What?

05:13.147 --> 05:17.083
I guess my only options
here are Oleg and Earl.

05:17.084 --> 05:20.286
Woof, real Murderers' Row.

05:20.287 --> 05:21.954
Who are you gonna have waitress?

05:21.955 --> 05:23.689
'Cause you know they'll have to match

05:23.690 --> 05:27.026
the extremely low bar set
by my associate and myself.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.261
Ohh!

05:28.262 --> 05:30.229
Oh, can I do it?

05:30.230 --> 05:32.231
Oh, who am I kidding?

05:32.232 --> 05:34.200
Or course I can!

05:34.201 --> 05:38.538
I actually used to be
a waitress at Pooters.

05:38.539 --> 05:40.239
You mean Hooters?

05:40.240 --> 05:42.875
No, it was Poland's version.

05:42.876 --> 05:46.179
Yeah, all the waitresses
were bottomless.

05:46.180 --> 05:48.881
I'm hoping there were a
lot of hairnets involved.

05:48.882 --> 05:51.316
Oh, you'd think so.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.356
Han, I'd say you drive
like a little old lady,

05:57.357 --> 05:59.325
but three of them just passed us.

05:59.326 --> 06:02.595
I had more fun driving
my bitchy friend Neil

06:02.596 --> 06:04.931
to get his blisters drained.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.599
Also, what's the strategy here?

06:06.600 --> 06:08.367
We've been driving for hours.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.570
Well, once we find an open airport,

06:10.571 --> 06:13.072
we'll fly to L.A., where
Max will surprise Randy,

06:13.073 --> 06:15.241
and she'll be all, "Ahhh,"

06:15.242 --> 06:18.511
and he'll be all, "Ahhh."

06:18.512 --> 06:21.581
First of all, great Randy impression.

06:21.582 --> 06:25.151
I almost gave you a little "Wahhh""

06:25.152 --> 06:26.819
You girls have less of a game plan

06:26.820 --> 06:29.622
than any season of
American Horror Story.

06:29.623 --> 06:32.291
Well, who really needs
a game plan anyway?

06:32.292 --> 06:34.660
I'm on vacation, baby.

06:34.661 --> 06:37.096
See? Didn't even tear up that time.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.031
What's with these snacks?

06:39.032 --> 06:40.266
Vegetables?

06:40.267 --> 06:43.135
Are you on that bunny diet again?

06:43.136 --> 06:45.371
No, I gained weight on that somehow.

06:45.372 --> 06:49.175
Han, there's a lot
of Goo Goo Dolls here.

06:49.176 --> 06:52.612
GGD-Live Goo. Wow.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.714
I'm taking music criticism

06:54.715 --> 06:57.416
from a proud member
of the Juggalo nation?

06:57.417 --> 06:59.384
Hand me a radish.

07:01.487 --> 07:04.957
I mean, how long are you
supposed to chew a radish?

07:04.958 --> 07:06.359
Forever?

07:06.360 --> 07:09.295
Can I interest anyone in a side trip

07:09.296 --> 07:10.630
to Pine Creek Gorge?

07:10.631 --> 07:12.231
If you love the Grand Canyon,

07:12.232 --> 07:15.468
you'll think Pine Creek
Gorge is pretty good.

07:15.469 --> 07:19.705
Oh, my seasonal gourd.

07:19.706 --> 07:22.975
Look at Randy's Snapchat story.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.644
This movie's got such a large budget,

07:24.645 --> 07:26.245
they even got the lawyer is own trailer.

07:26.269 --> 07:28.047
Oh! Scratch that.

07:28.048 --> 07:32.218
I'm sharing it with
a very large scorpion.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.087
You're jealous of a scorpion now?

07:35.088 --> 07:36.222
That's where we're at?

07:36.223 --> 07:37.657
No!

07:37.658 --> 07:39.892
There's a finger on Randy's shoulder.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.460
A woman's finger.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.362
Manicured nail, no wedding ring.

07:43.363 --> 07:45.064
How dare she?

07:45.065 --> 07:47.867
Yea nor nay on Pine Creek Gorge?

07:47.868 --> 07:49.135
The exit's in three miles,

07:49.136 --> 07:51.537
and I should start changing lanes.

07:51.538 --> 07:53.506
So that's a maybe?

07:53.507 --> 07:55.841
I gotta finger this out!

07:55.842 --> 07:58.644
Ugh, why can't you zoom in on a video?

07:58.645 --> 08:00.246
I know we have the technology.

08:00.247 --> 08:01.814
It was used against me

08:01.815 --> 08:05.551
in the case of Bass Pro
Shops versus Max Black.

08:05.552 --> 08:08.187
Ugh, I think there's a pit in my fig.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.555
That's a prune,

08:09.556 --> 08:11.157
and I'd pace yourself.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.859
Caroline, could you call
the diner and check in?

08:13.860 --> 08:15.962
I've been getting the machine all day,

08:15.963 --> 08:18.864
and I gotta make sure Oleg
isn't shooting a porno there.

08:18.865 --> 08:20.232
Oh, he didn't get the funding.

08:20.233 --> 08:22.867
His Kinkstarter campaign fizzled out.

08:25.738 --> 08:27.773
There, the phone is unplugged.

08:27.774 --> 08:31.077
Good luck calling the
police now, table two.

08:31.078 --> 08:33.245
Wow, you unplugged that phone

08:33.246 --> 08:35.780
faster than we unplugged my Aunt Esther.

08:35.782 --> 08:38.618
She was a mean lady.

08:38.619 --> 08:42.288
Sophie, ready to
re-enter the workforce?

08:42.289 --> 08:45.024
I'm ready.

08:45.025 --> 08:48.894
The question is, are you ready?

08:48.895 --> 08:52.898
And the answer is no, I am not.

08:52.899 --> 08:55.067
Hey, everybody!

08:55.068 --> 08:57.637
Can I take your order?

08:57.638 --> 09:00.873
Miss, sparkling or still?

09:00.874 --> 09:05.076
How's everything tasting?

09:08.214 --> 09:11.417
♪ Mmmbop, Ba duba dop ♪

09:11.418 --> 09:14.086
♪ Ba Du bop, Ba duba ♪

09:14.087 --> 09:17.423
♪ Ba dup bop, Ba Du, yeah ♪

09:17.424 --> 09:19.759
♪ Mmmbop, Ba ♪

09:19.760 --> 09:21.761
I wish you guys would win American Idol

09:21.762 --> 09:24.130
so I'd never have to
hear from you ever again.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.298
Oh, come on, Max. Listen up.

09:26.299 --> 09:29.101
What's a road trip
without a sing-along?

09:29.102 --> 09:30.936
I don't know, tolerable.

09:30.937 --> 09:34.040
Now let's talk about something
everyone's interested in.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.008
I screen-grabbed Randy's video,

09:36.009 --> 09:37.410
which enabled me to zoom in.

09:37.411 --> 09:39.178
And upon zooming, I realized that...

09:39.179 --> 09:40.846
You're going crazy?

09:40.847 --> 09:44.083
Max, seriously, maybe
we should go back home.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.551
Randy blocked you.

09:45.552 --> 09:47.520
You have to expect there
might be a new finger

09:47.521 --> 09:48.688
in his life.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.456
I am not going crazy.

09:50.457 --> 09:52.425
I'm merely scouring the World Wide Web

09:52.426 --> 09:54.794
for female friends of Randy
who are tagged in a photo of him

09:54.795 --> 09:56.295
with their index fingers cropped out.

09:56.296 --> 09:58.064
That way I can piece
the two photos together

09:58.065 --> 09:59.932
jigsaw style to get
the answers I deserve,

09:59.933 --> 10:02.668
and oh, my God, I think
I'm having a breakdown.

10:02.669 --> 10:04.403
She's not the only one.

10:07.441 --> 10:09.841
Please tell me that was
Caroline's prunes kicking in.

10:18.627 --> 10:21.029
I can't believe we're broken
down in the middle of nowhere.

10:21.030 --> 10:24.901
Amanda Knox had a better
vacation than this.

10:24.902 --> 10:27.571
We have to start walking.
Leave that suitcase here.

10:27.572 --> 10:28.838
What did you pack in there,

10:28.839 --> 10:31.207
one of your long-winded anecdotes?

10:31.208 --> 10:32.475
Funny story actually.

10:32.476 --> 10:34.077
I was going through my sweaters,

10:34.078 --> 10:35.979
and I realized that when I was 14...

10:35.980 --> 10:38.181
Hold that thought forever.

10:38.182 --> 10:42.218
Now you wanna find a finger,
you gotta use a finger.

10:42.219 --> 10:44.854
Max, no! We can't hitchhike.

10:44.855 --> 10:46.856
What if some psycho picks us up?

10:46.857 --> 10:50.393
Really, who wouldn't
want to wear this skin?

10:50.394 --> 10:53.229
I think the problem is the transmission.

10:53.230 --> 10:55.699
There is none.

10:55.700 --> 10:59.269
I hitchhiked all the time in school.

10:59.270 --> 11:00.971
Nothing bad ever happened.

11:00.972 --> 11:03.440
I did spend a year locked
in a guy's shed once,

11:03.441 --> 11:04.874
but that was mutual.

11:04.875 --> 11:07.544
I'll tell you what I told my prom date,

11:07.545 --> 11:09.079
put that finger away.

11:09.080 --> 11:11.081
I thought your prom date was gay.

11:11.082 --> 11:14.717
He was. He was doing a lot of this.

11:23.360 --> 11:25.228
Oh, good, tinted windows

11:25.229 --> 11:28.531
for a more private murdering experience.

11:28.532 --> 11:31.735
Um, this thing is smoking
more than my grandma

11:31.736 --> 11:34.371
at the Bingo finals.

11:34.372 --> 11:36.339
You girls stuck?

11:36.340 --> 11:39.409
I think "stagnant" is
a better word for us.

11:39.410 --> 11:43.279
Name's Becky. With the good hair.

11:44.315 --> 11:45.782
Y'all need a ride?

11:45.783 --> 11:49.019
Thanks. We're going west, Fievel style.

11:49.020 --> 11:51.788
If you could take us somewhere
with outgoing flights.

11:51.789 --> 11:53.256
I can drive if you want.

11:53.257 --> 11:56.059
I used to do it for
a Colombian drug lor...

11:56.060 --> 11:57.761
Frito-Lay.

11:57.762 --> 11:59.763
I can get you all the way to Missouri,

11:59.764 --> 12:01.931
home to street violence
and a large percentage

12:01.932 --> 12:04.701
of America's OxyContin epidemic.

12:04.702 --> 12:08.271
Great, and, Max, at
least you'll know people.

12:08.272 --> 12:12.042
Oh, good, we got a ride,
'cause that car is deader

12:12.043 --> 12:13.443
than the conversation

12:13.444 --> 12:15.645
at the Jolie-Pitt
Thanksgiving this year.

12:15.646 --> 12:18.114
Oh, sorry, you girls can come,

12:18.115 --> 12:20.583
but I don't let strange men into my cab.

12:20.584 --> 12:23.453
Oh, I can vouch for Han. He's not a man.

12:23.454 --> 12:26.022
It's okay, girls. Go ahead without me.

12:26.023 --> 12:27.757
I'll just call AAA.

12:27.758 --> 12:30.025
Cool. Later, hater.

12:31.227 --> 12:32.295
Wait!

12:32.296 --> 12:33.830
You're really leaving?

12:33.831 --> 12:35.932
Who leaves someone on
the side of the road

12:35.933 --> 12:38.401
in the middle of nowhere?

12:38.402 --> 12:40.536
You're not people!

12:45.408 --> 12:47.811
Excuse me, Miss?

12:47.812 --> 12:50.747
Oh, not you again.

12:50.748 --> 12:53.116
Listen, don't eat this.

12:53.117 --> 12:57.353
I ordered a steak, and
this is a dirty washcloth.

12:57.354 --> 12:59.154
You want me to heat it up?

13:00.490 --> 13:02.992
I mean, why am I always
getting you stuff?

13:02.993 --> 13:05.628
How come you're not scratching my back?

13:07.932 --> 13:10.066
See how I told him off?

13:10.067 --> 13:12.836
You know, just like
Max does, right girl?

13:12.837 --> 13:15.405
Why are you calling me girl?

13:15.406 --> 13:16.740
I'm calling you a woman.

13:16.741 --> 13:18.942
You like, like the girls do with Han,

13:18.943 --> 13:20.877
only he takes it.

13:20.878 --> 13:23.713
I mean, I wasn't expecting all this.

13:23.714 --> 13:24.881
Well, neither was I.

13:24.882 --> 13:27.015
This is supposed to be my nap time.

13:28.785 --> 13:30.353
This is my vacation.

13:30.354 --> 13:32.622
That's how bad my real life is.

13:32.623 --> 13:34.591
And I'm trying to get back with my ex.

13:34.592 --> 13:37.193
He blocked me on his phone,
and I am one diaper away

13:37.194 --> 13:40.263
from being that crazy lady astronaut.

13:40.264 --> 13:42.799
I never had the courage of
putting myself out there.

13:42.800 --> 13:44.968
I mean, romantically speaking.

13:44.969 --> 13:47.870
I was on the Seal Team
that killed Bin Laden.

13:49.405 --> 13:50.540
I don't know.

13:50.541 --> 13:52.008
I may look tough on the outside,

13:52.009 --> 13:54.177
but underneath it all
is a scared little girl

13:54.178 --> 13:56.546
and a lot of homemade tattoos.

13:56.547 --> 13:59.449
Well, you clearly have good judgment.

13:59.450 --> 14:01.785
Take a look at this video
and tell me if this finger

14:01.786 --> 14:03.653
looks like it's been
in my boyfriend's mouth.

14:03.654 --> 14:05.488
Hold on, let me grab my glasses!

14:05.489 --> 14:07.657
Whoa, Becks! You wanna pick a lane?

14:07.658 --> 14:09.559
We're currently in all three.

14:09.560 --> 14:11.427
Don't distract her from the video.

14:11.428 --> 14:12.529
Hey...

14:12.530 --> 14:15.064
Oh, like this.

14:15.065 --> 14:18.101
Enough talking. Show
us your ass, white boy.

14:20.171 --> 14:21.738
So sorry.

14:21.739 --> 14:23.740
I didn't know the horn would be so loud,

14:23.741 --> 14:25.575
but could you scooch?

14:25.576 --> 14:27.343
Ooh, I wasn't driving?

14:27.344 --> 14:31.681
Man, being a Seal really
messed with my head.

14:31.682 --> 14:33.783
I don't know why I didn't
think of this before,

14:33.784 --> 14:36.786
but my friend, Sloppy Joe,
has a one-engine plane.

14:36.787 --> 14:39.222
He might be able to fly
y'all all the way to L.A.

14:39.223 --> 14:40.857
I'm sorry, what?

14:40.858 --> 14:44.694
A messy sandwich is
gonna fly us to L.A.?

14:44.695 --> 14:46.896
Okay.

14:46.897 --> 14:48.298
Sloppy was an old high school crush

14:48.322 --> 14:49.799
I never had the guts to go for.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.401
Man was a legend there.

14:51.402 --> 14:53.503
He was a senior for nine years.

14:53.504 --> 14:55.672
Thanks, Becky With the Good Hair.

14:55.673 --> 14:57.707
And you'll find someone, I'm sure.

14:57.708 --> 14:59.242
You just gotta go for it.

14:59.243 --> 15:01.511
That's what she keeps telling me.

15:01.512 --> 15:03.078
I know, but she will.

15:12.984 --> 15:15.553
I don't think we've
formally met, Sloppy Joe.

15:15.554 --> 15:17.321
I'm Caroline Channing.

15:17.322 --> 15:19.790
They'll be reporting
our deaths together.

15:19.791 --> 15:22.059
You're on your own there.

15:22.060 --> 15:25.596
They reported mine five years ago.

15:25.597 --> 15:28.900
We're on a ghost plane? Awesome!

15:28.901 --> 15:32.170
Just curious, will there
be a beverage service?

15:32.171 --> 15:34.071
You want some of my beer?

15:34.072 --> 15:36.541
That's all right, you already
spilled most of it on me.

15:36.542 --> 15:39.110
I bet that's why they call him sloppy.

15:39.111 --> 15:41.646
Nope, my landings are a mess.

15:41.647 --> 15:45.283
Caroline, look at the bright side.

15:45.284 --> 15:47.185
How? None of the lights work.

15:47.186 --> 15:48.719
We're on our way to L.A.,

15:48.720 --> 15:51.622
and sloppy took Randy's
voucher as payment.

15:51.623 --> 15:54.091
And then rolled a
nice, fat joint with it.

15:54.092 --> 15:56.294
You bet I did.

15:56.295 --> 15:58.930
- Whoa!
- Ride the lightning!

15:58.931 --> 16:00.865
Yee-haw! Do it back.

16:00.866 --> 16:03.935
Let me hear you say, "Yee-haw!"

16:03.936 --> 16:06.569
Yee-hawwww!

16:15.680 --> 16:17.682
I'm just glad you found me.

16:17.683 --> 16:19.684
I was about to build
a hut for the night.

16:19.685 --> 16:22.053
I thought you said you
didn't pick up strange men.

16:22.054 --> 16:23.654
I didn't.

16:23.655 --> 16:27.590
Until a new friend convinced
me I gotta take a chance.

16:30.127 --> 16:32.663
How fast can this old rig go?

16:32.664 --> 16:36.567
This old rig can go all night, baby.

16:36.568 --> 16:40.037
Doesn't answer my question at all,

16:40.038 --> 16:43.039
but let's do the damn thing.

16:52.116 --> 16:54.459
This flight's a lot bumpier
than I thought it was gonna be.

16:54.460 --> 16:55.953
Speaking of bumps,

16:55.954 --> 16:58.589
y'all don't have any blow, do you?

16:58.590 --> 17:00.424
Yeah, that's what this flight needs,

17:00.425 --> 17:02.660
a more jittery pilot.

17:02.661 --> 17:04.095
- Wow.
- Oh!

17:04.096 --> 17:05.863
Randy just posted a new video.

17:05.864 --> 17:07.999
Eh, buffer faster!

17:08.000 --> 17:09.934
Ugh, do you get any bars up here?

17:09.935 --> 17:13.137
If I did, I wouldn't be
asking you for cocaine.

17:14.506 --> 17:16.874
Never mind, don't need it.

17:16.875 --> 17:18.643
We're going down.

17:18.644 --> 17:21.345
Going down? My least
favorite expression.

17:21.346 --> 17:23.580
And now I hate it even more.

17:23.582 --> 17:25.616
At least in this version of going down

17:25.617 --> 17:28.986
you don't have to spoon afterwards.

17:28.987 --> 17:30.454
- Oh, my God!
- Ah!

17:30.455 --> 17:32.456
Caroline, amazing news.

17:32.457 --> 17:33.924
You found parachutes?

17:33.925 --> 17:36.127
Or that part of the wing that tore away?

17:36.128 --> 17:37.862
Ha, oh, no, we're goners.

17:37.863 --> 17:40.531
But Silver Linings Playbook,

17:40.532 --> 17:43.768
that finger belonged to Randy's mom!

17:43.769 --> 17:45.403
She's visiting him on set.

17:45.404 --> 17:47.705
Ah, and she's not even that cute.

17:47.706 --> 17:50.641
I am gonna be so mad at you in heaven.

17:50.642 --> 17:52.376
You think I'm going to heaven?

17:52.377 --> 17:54.645
She thinks I'm going to heaven.

17:56.815 --> 18:00.351
Plane's too heavy. We
gotta drop some weight.

18:00.352 --> 18:04.155
I knew those curly fries at
the truck stop were a mistake,

18:04.156 --> 18:06.857
but they didn't offer
a healthy alternative.

18:06.858 --> 18:09.160
- Hold this.
- What? Ohh!

18:09.161 --> 18:12.697
Hey, Sloppy, the sky is that way!

18:12.698 --> 18:16.000
I like this, too.

18:16.001 --> 18:18.936
This suitcase has gotta go.

18:18.937 --> 18:20.371
No, all my clothes are in there.

18:20.372 --> 18:22.340
All of our money! Our credit card!

18:22.341 --> 18:24.408
There is no way that
that one tiny suitcase

18:24.409 --> 18:27.143
is causing all these
problems with your plane.

18:34.418 --> 18:37.822
Very well, perhaps I overpacked.

18:37.823 --> 18:40.623
Beer me.

18:43.961 --> 18:45.796
Pick up!

18:45.797 --> 18:49.266
Unless that's a huge problem for you.

18:49.267 --> 18:50.568
That's it.

18:50.569 --> 18:52.703
I'm gonna tell you the same thing

18:52.704 --> 18:54.505
that I told Pooters

18:54.506 --> 18:58.976
when they added pants to the uniform.

18:58.977 --> 19:01.212
I quit.

19:01.213 --> 19:02.613
You quit?

19:02.614 --> 19:04.782
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

19:04.783 --> 19:06.817
You're fired.

19:06.818 --> 19:08.686
Oh, yeah?

19:08.687 --> 19:11.288
Yeah!

19:11.289 --> 19:14.491
Have I been a bad waitress?

19:16.994 --> 19:19.796
The naughtiest.

19:22.733 --> 19:26.203
Uh, they're not gonna have
sex in a restaurant, are they?

19:26.204 --> 19:28.672
Well, it wouldn't be the first time.

19:28.673 --> 19:32.876
Hell, it wouldn't be the eighth time.

19:33.611 --> 19:36.080
Pick up, Oleg.

19:36.081 --> 19:38.948
Oh, yeah, man. This is happening.

19:40.818 --> 19:44.588
And that's when I married
my high school sweetheart.

19:44.589 --> 19:47.458
Well, she was in high school. I was 38.

19:47.459 --> 19:49.794
Another terrific story, Sloppy.

19:49.795 --> 19:51.962
Almost makes me forget we have no money,

19:51.963 --> 19:55.065
no clothes, and we're getting
zero mileage for this flight.

19:55.066 --> 19:57.101
Silver Linings Playbook, though.

19:57.102 --> 19:58.536
Little Randy update.

19:58.537 --> 20:00.404
Max, I don't care how expensive it is.

20:00.405 --> 20:03.507
You are going to
therapy when we get back.

20:03.508 --> 20:05.371
Well, that's a wrap on
the first day of filming

20:05.372 --> 20:06.510
here in Austin, Texas.

20:06.511 --> 20:07.871
Or as they say around these parts,

20:07.895 --> 20:09.246
don't Tess with Mexas.

20:09.247 --> 20:10.514
Whoa.

20:10.515 --> 20:14.618
Don't drink on a scorpion bite.

20:14.619 --> 20:17.488
The man ain't wrong.

20:17.489 --> 20:19.223
Wait, so Randy's not in Los Angeles?

20:19.224 --> 20:20.758
He's in Texas.

20:20.759 --> 20:23.727
Wow, you're a bad stalker, Max.

20:23.728 --> 20:25.729
Sloppy, hang a Ralph or a Louie.

20:25.730 --> 20:27.565
Whatever gets us to Texas.

20:27.566 --> 20:29.733
Eh, there's two things
that Slop won't do.

20:29.734 --> 20:32.269
Alert the proper authorities
of my flight pattern

20:32.270 --> 20:35.272
or step foot in Texas.

20:35.273 --> 20:37.074
You need to make your own way there.

20:37.075 --> 20:40.678
I'll drop you here. I gotta whiz anyway.

20:40.679 --> 20:42.813
Ah! Drop us here?

20:42.814 --> 20:45.716
Whiz? What does that mean?

20:45.717 --> 20:47.751
Uh, I think it means I'm jumping out

20:47.752 --> 20:50.387
of another plane this month.

20:50.388 --> 20:54.157
You know what? I miss the diner.
