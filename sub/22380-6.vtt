you go off, do something stupid?

21:40.466 --> 21:43.553
'Cause I'd kind of like to know
what I'm getting myself into.

21:43.594 --> 21:45.388
(sighs)

21:45.430 --> 21:49.892
Did you just say
"for the rest of our lives"?

21:51.686 --> 21:53.563
Yeah.

21:53.604 --> 21:56.983
Meaning, like, together?

21:57.025 --> 21:58.735
Yeah.

22:06.951 --> 22:09.579
This baby comes out bald,
I might have to get him a wig.

22:09.620 --> 22:11.122
I don't know if
he'll come out bald,

22:11.164 --> 22:13.708
but he won't have a lot of hair;
not as much as you, not yet.

22:13.750 --> 22:14.959

we're thinking Glinda,

22:29.807 --> 22:32.268
and if it's a boy, Merlin.

22:32.310 --> 22:33.978
But nothing's set in stone.

Good, I think.
