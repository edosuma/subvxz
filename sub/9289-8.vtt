00:13.995 --> 00:17.863
- Why are they asking Dad questions?
- You started a witch hunt in our family.

00:17.958 --> 00:20.330
- What did you accuse my father of?
- I didn't.

00:20.418 --> 00:22.577
You're pointing at him to cover yourself!

00:22.671 --> 00:25.209
He says Bob Warner
had dealings with Syed Ali.

00:25.298 --> 00:28.086
Bring them in.
We'll separate them and turn up the heat.

00:28.176 --> 00:31.628
I need help. I have to get into
my father's private records.

00:31.721 --> 00:33.548
Who is the man in Visalia?!

00:33.640 --> 00:37.258
The man in Visalia is Mamud Faheen.
He also thinks I'm in prison.

00:37.352 --> 00:40.223
- You make him believe you got out.
- I need to see Mamud.

00:40.313 --> 00:43.813
- Should we go?
- Not until I have confirmation it's Faheen.

00:43.900 --> 00:45.181
That's it. Everybody go!

00:48.113 --> 00:52.324
- We have to talk about Ron Wieland.
- Does anyone know he's sequestered?

00:52.409 --> 00:56.407
No, but soon they'll figure out
the last person they saw him with was you.

00:56.496 --> 01:00.790
I've invoked executive privilege and granted
Sherry provisional security clearance.

01:00.876 --> 01:04.575
Seems every time I turn around,
somebody advises me to send you away.

01:04.671 --> 01:05.916
Why don't you?

01:06.006 --> 01:08.841
You may be able to
get information nobody else can.

01:09.676 --> 01:14.421
- Damm it! Just play it cool.
- Cool? We're in a stolen car.

01:14.514 --> 01:17.219
Step out of the car, please.
And open the trunk.

01:17.309 --> 01:19.385
- Oh, my God!
- Carla!

01:19.478 --> 01:22.728
- Oh, my God! He killed her!
- Put your hands behind your head.

01:33.825 --> 01:36.577
- So whose car is it?
- It's her father's.

01:37.496 --> 01:41.244
- Did he give it to you?
- Not exactly.

01:41.792 --> 01:46.453
- Then what, exactly?
- We took it without permission.

01:46.546 --> 01:50.626
- You stole this car?
- I can't believe he killed her.

01:50.717 --> 01:54.379
Gary Matheson, the man Kim works for,

01:54.579 --> 01:56.969
beat his wife and was starting
to hurt his daughter.

01:57.057 --> 01:59.974
Kim called me to help
get Megan away from him.

02:00.060 --> 02:02.235
If that's true,
why didn't you go to the police?

02:02.335 --> 02:05.137
Why do I find you 20 miles outside of LA?

02:08.485 --> 02:11.320
I thought so.
You have the right to remain silent.

02:11.404 --> 02:14.820
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

02:14.908 --> 02:19.653
You have the right to an attorney. If you can't
afford one, one will be appointed for you.

02:19.746 --> 02:21.953
Do you understand these rights?

02:30.590 --> 02:33.081
Is it safe in here?

02:33.176 --> 02:35.928
Stay away from cordoned areas,
you'll be all right.

02:36.012 --> 02:40.010
- This building was bombed this morning.
- Yeah.

02:40.100 --> 02:42.389
- Hey.
- You got the rooms ready?

02:42.477 --> 02:46.605
Yeah. They're a little messed up,
but good enough for interrogation.

02:46.690 --> 02:52.645
- How we doing here?
- Final tally... 30 dead, 17 wounded.

02:52.737 --> 02:55.489
Davidorff and Lindauer are critical.

02:55.574 --> 02:57.650
What about Paula?

03:02.956 --> 03:06.159
Could you do me a favour
and take them back to the rooms?

03:06.251 --> 03:08.409
Follow me, please.

03:11.381 --> 03:14.335
Listen, can I talk to you alone?

03:14.426 --> 03:17.759
Stay with them. I'll be there in a minute.

03:20.557 --> 03:25.598
- Find anything new?
- No, just what I told you on the phone.

03:25.687 --> 03:30.230
The two men are contradicting each other.
There's definitely a tie to Syed Ali.

03:30.317 --> 03:32.444
Looks like Ali is at the centre of this.

03:32.644 --> 03:35.144
I hope it brings us closer
to finding the nuke.

03:35.238 --> 03:38.607
- Just tell me how hard I can push him.
- Hard as you have to.

03:38.700 --> 03:43.658
Stick bamboo shoots under their fingernails.
Get what they got. Time's running out.

03:48.919 --> 03:54.257
Call Henderson at FBI. Set up a conference
call with him and the Attorney General.

03:55.467 --> 03:59.334
- Lynne. You have a sec?
- Sure, Roger.

04:04.810 --> 04:10.052
I understand that Sherry Palmer has
been given provisional security clearance.

04:10.148 --> 04:14.276
Yes, that's right. The president
has invoked executive privilege.

04:14.361 --> 04:16.437
You OK with that?

04:18.322 --> 04:22.107
- It's different.
- Yes, it is.

04:22.202 --> 04:24.278
I've weighed in about it.

04:24.371 --> 04:28.831
If I feel that she's becoming a problem,
I'll let the president know.

04:29.876 --> 04:33.494
She's his ex-wife.
That's a problem all by itself.

04:33.588 --> 04:37.586
No. Sandra, thank you.
I'll get back with you.

04:47.185 --> 04:51.017
- Tell me about Ron Wieland.
- What about him?

04:51.106 --> 04:56.562
I just got off the phone with
Sandra Ivany at the network.

04:56.653 --> 05:01.114
She said no one's heard from him
since he met with you this morning.

05:04.369 --> 05:08.581
David? You didn't detain him, did you?

05:08.665 --> 05:12.248
You are here today to help me,
not question my judgment.

05:12.335 --> 05:14.542
And I am trying to help.

05:15.255 --> 05:18.042
What's going on with Wieland?

05:18.133 --> 05:21.668
- He was gonna go public with a rumour.
- About the bomb?

05:22.179 --> 05:24.883
I cannot afford a panic.

05:25.474 --> 05:29.721
You can't keep him locked up indefinitely.

05:29.811 --> 05:32.267
People are already asking questions.

05:32.355 --> 05:36.223
We're holding him at the OC.
When the crisis passes, I'll let him go.

05:36.318 --> 05:39.153
Well, meanwhile you've got a problem.

05:39.237 --> 05:42.986
His disappearance could raise questions
you don't want to answer.

05:43.074 --> 05:46.325
- I put Armus on it.
- Apparently it hasn't helped.

05:46.411 --> 05:50.325
- The word is getting out.
- What do you suggest?

05:52.709 --> 05:55.663
Give him an on-air exclusive
when this is over.

05:55.754 --> 05:58.708
I offered that to him. He didn't want it.

05:59.716 --> 06:02.468
Then let me talk to him.

06:02.552 --> 06:06.550
David, one talent you know I have
is dealing with the media.

06:06.640 --> 06:09.724
And I know Ron. He likes me.

06:13.188 --> 06:15.596
No. You're here to gather information.

06:15.690 --> 06:18.360
And to help. You said so yourself.

06:18.443 --> 06:21.563
And today you can't afford to ignore that.

06:22.531 --> 06:25.401
Let me try talking to Ron.

06:29.287 --> 06:31.446
What would you say to him?

06:32.958 --> 06:36.457
I'll make it worth his while
not to say anything.

06:40.048 --> 06:42.124
- Kim, I'm scared!
- It's OK, Megan.

06:42.217 --> 06:45.551
You're gonna be OK. It's gonna be fine.

06:46.054 --> 06:49.470
Where are you taking her?
She can't go back to LA.

06:49.558 --> 06:52.724
- Why not?
- It's not safe.

06:56.356 --> 06:59.891
- Why didn't you tell him?
- My dad said not to tell anyone.

06:59.985 --> 07:02.523
He didn't know you'd be charged with murder.

07:02.612 --> 07:04.901
- I'm gonna tell him.
- No. You can't.

07:04.990 --> 07:08.738
I'm telling you, Miguel,
my dad said no one can know about this.

07:08.827 --> 07:11.863
I think you should tell him who your dad is.

07:11.955 --> 07:16.202
Let them call him. Let your dad explain
why we're trying to get out of town.

07:17.502 --> 07:19.827
Come on, let's go. Come on.

07:38.315 --> 07:42.063
My father works at CTU,
the place that got bombed this morning.

07:42.152 --> 07:44.620
His name is Jack Bauer. Please call him.

07:44.720 --> 07:47.906
He'll explain why it's not
safe to be in LA today.

07:47.991 --> 07:51.823
You can call your father
after you've been processed.

08:00.587 --> 08:03.256
Nina: "Who are you working with in LA?"

08:09.763 --> 08:13.843
Faheen: "I'm not going to
give you any information."

08:24.319 --> 08:29.479
Faheen: "It's too late. Don't waste your time.
The operation will be done."

08:29.574 --> 08:31.863
- This is not working.
- It will work.

08:31.952 --> 08:34.869
- I just need a little more time.
- No, you're done.

08:34.955 --> 08:37.825
- Jack, don't do this!
- On your feet.

08:37.916 --> 08:40.073
- We're going back.
- Did he talk?

08:40.168 --> 08:42.659
- No, he wouldn't talk to her.
- What do we do?

08:42.754 --> 08:45.874
Have Division set up a white room.
We'll handle it in LA.

08:45.966 --> 08:50.046
Wrong move. The deeper you bring him in,
the more he'll shut down.

08:50.137 --> 08:53.091
- We'll see.
- Rick, give me more time with him!

08:53.181 --> 08:56.218
You've had enough.
Make sure Faheen gets to the airport.

08:56.309 --> 08:58.385
- And you?
- I'll be right behind you.

08:58.478 --> 09:01.598
- You see what he's doing?
- Jack, you can't take her.

09:01.690 --> 09:05.023
I have a document signed by
the president! He can't do this!

09:05.110 --> 09:09.855
- My orders are to stay with you and her.
- Forget that. All they need is Faheen.

09:09.948 --> 09:12.819
Don't push this.
I can't leave you alone with her.

09:12.909 --> 09:18.117
- It's got nothing to do with you. Back off.
- Step away from the car, Bauer.

09:41.104 --> 09:44.722
- Paul Koplin. Nice to meet you.
- Thanks for coming. Come in.

09:44.816 --> 09:49.525
No problem. I spoke to Ralph, he told me
what files we're going to have to get into.

09:49.613 --> 09:54.405
- The ones that linked Reza to this terrorist?
- Yes. That's Syed Ali.

09:54.493 --> 09:57.577
The company computer
is networked into this house.

09:57.662 --> 10:02.205
I'll have to hack some passwords.
I assume you're authorising me to do that.

10:02.292 --> 10:05.993
- Yeah. Yeah, of course.
- Is this it?

10:06.087 --> 10:11.248
I don't know why they dragged my family in
for questioning on my sister's wedding day.

10:11.343 --> 10:16.550
I'm a little surprised about that, too,
but it's a whole new world out there now.

10:21.394 --> 10:26.140
I'm sorry that happened, but as private
investigators we're required by law

10:26.233 --> 10:32.318
to report any terrorist-related information
to Homeland Security right off.

10:34.324 --> 10:40.362
Here it is. I accessed the monthly statements
but I couldn't get into any detailed records.

10:40.455 --> 10:43.290
All right. Let's see what we can do.

10:55.637 --> 10:58.721
Armus? Where are you going?

10:58.807 --> 11:02.342
I'm taking Mrs. Palmer
to one of the conference rooms.

11:02.436 --> 11:04.677
- Does she have clearance?
- Excuse me.

11:04.771 --> 11:08.816
But you don't need to speak about me
as if I weren't here, Mr. Stanton.

11:08.900 --> 11:11.142
I'm sorry, Mrs. Palmer. Roger Stanton.

11:11.236 --> 11:13.905
I know who you are, Roger.

11:13.989 --> 11:16.943
It's just a highly restricted area.

11:17.033 --> 11:20.367
Yes, I know. However,
I have been granted access.

11:21.371 --> 11:25.700
- Why do you need to be here?
- That you'll have to ask the president.

11:25.792 --> 11:27.868
- Armus.
- Excuse me.

11:29.171 --> 11:35.588
My apologies, Mrs. Palmer. It's just we're very
careful about the flow of information today.

11:35.677 --> 11:38.298
There's no need to apologise.

11:38.388 --> 11:43.727
I would assume that you're careful
about the flow of information every day.

11:45.520 --> 11:47.679
Thank you.

11:55.572 --> 11:59.356
- Sherry Palmer.
- Hello, Ron.

11:59.451 --> 12:03.531
Just when I thought this day
couldn't get any stranger.

12:03.622 --> 12:06.872
I can imagine
you're not happy about all of this.

12:06.958 --> 12:12.035
- I'd like to know what "this" is.
- I don't exactly know myself.

12:12.881 --> 12:15.550
I don't believe you, Sherry.

12:15.634 --> 12:20.094
But unless they kill me
I'm gonna have the story of the year.

12:20.180 --> 12:22.636
I was kidnapped
by the leader of the free world.

12:22.724 --> 12:25.725
That's not necessarily true, Ron.

12:25.811 --> 12:30.271
There actually has been precedent
for this kind of executive action.

12:30.357 --> 12:33.856
If you're here to shut me up,
you're wasting your time.

12:33.944 --> 12:34.954
I sensed I was onto something.

12:35.014 --> 12:38.570
The fact that they locked me in
here only confirms it.

12:39.366 --> 12:42.283
I'm coming out of here
with a story. Deal with it.

12:45.247 --> 12:46.789
Hm.

12:48.834 --> 12:52.368
- Mind if I sit down?
- Of course not.

12:57.801 --> 13:01.585
We'd like to release you, Ron.

13:02.347 --> 13:04.505
And we will.

13:04.599 --> 13:09.594
But we need assurances you won't go public
with the rumour you threatened to broadcast.

13:09.688 --> 13:15.275
In return for what? I get an exclusive with
the president on some watered-down story?

13:15.360 --> 13:20.318
Not a watered-down story. Something else.

13:20.407 --> 13:25.828
You go out there, let everyone know
that you are not missing.

13:25.912 --> 13:28.783
Don't say anything about this morning.

13:31.001 --> 13:35.995
The president will let you inside
of the OC to report first-hand.

13:36.089 --> 13:39.423
No journalist has ever been inside there.

13:43.430 --> 13:46.550
Why did he send you
down here to make this offer?

13:46.641 --> 13:51.849
In fact, what are you even doing
back inside David Palmer's circle?

13:51.938 --> 13:54.097
Take the deal, Ron.

13:56.443 --> 14:01.899
In a couple of hours they'll brief you
and then you'll know more than I do.

15:09.558 --> 15:12.475
Hey! Guys, you need some help?

15:16.022 --> 15:17.896
Yeah.

15:35.208 --> 15:38.660
Nina: "The only way out of this
is to cooperate with them."

15:43.425 --> 15:46.924
Nina: "Mamud, it does your case
no good if you end up dead."

15:51.683 --> 15:54.933
"Think about it, Mamud.
We're on our way to Los Angeles."

16:01.151 --> 16:03.689
Faheen: "I'm not afraid to die."

16:40.857 --> 16:43.064
Nina: "How big is the bomb?"

16:48.490 --> 16:50.732
"What time is it supposed to go off?"

16:59.668 --> 17:03.915
Faheen: "You betrayed me.
You betrayed us all. Traitor."

17:05.214 --> 17:07.705
Bring her back here now.

17:13.390 --> 17:15.465
Come on.

17:20.271 --> 17:24.732
We are out of time. If you want to
live through this, be straight with me.

17:24.818 --> 17:28.233
- When was this planned?
- Six months before I was arrested.

17:28.320 --> 17:32.366
- And Faheen approached you?
- Yes, but through an intermediary.

17:32.451 --> 17:34.776
- He didn't tell you about the nuke?
- No.

17:34.870 --> 17:39.532
I didn't know what the endgame was.
I just knew it was something big.

17:39.624 --> 17:42.910
- Is there another way around Faheen?
- No.

17:47.174 --> 17:49.332
Is he really willing to die?

17:51.094 --> 17:52.968
Yes.

18:06.693 --> 18:09.267
Jack, what are we gonna do?

18:18.872 --> 18:21.410
Take her back.

18:49.569 --> 18:53.152
Don't drive too long on that spare.
There's not a lot of tread left.

18:53.240 --> 18:59.076
- Yes. Thank you very much, sir.
- Why not follow me to Ventura Boulevard?

18:59.162 --> 19:02.163
- There's a tire store there.
- No, no, no. We'll be fine.

19:02.249 --> 19:05.333
All right. You're all set.

19:05.418 --> 19:08.752
- Here. Please.
- Don't worry about it.

19:08.839 --> 19:12.504
You know anybody who needs
pool service, give 'em my card. OK?

19:12.592 --> 19:14.799
Of course, of course.

19:14.886 --> 19:17.804
- Thank you. Thank you, sir.
- See ya!

19:26.440 --> 19:30.140
The kid said it was dangerous
and to stay out of Los Angeles.

19:30.235 --> 19:33.569
This one told me a similar story.
No details, though.

19:33.655 --> 19:36.656
- Do you think it's true?
- I don't think so.

19:36.741 --> 19:38.818
- What, then?
- They're telling stories.

19:38.910 --> 19:42.030
- Want me to call it in?
- Wait until we get back, OK?

19:42.122 --> 19:44.245
- I'll see you there.
- Yeah.

19:47.085 --> 19:50.584
- Your friend's got quite an imagination.
- What did he say?

19:50.672 --> 19:55.915
That you were leaving town because
some bomb's supposed to go off in LA today.

19:58.263 --> 20:01.050
That what you meant
when you said it wasn't safe?

20:01.141 --> 20:04.510
Please, just call CTU
and try and reach my dad.

20:04.603 --> 20:09.597
You need to get Megan, the girl that
was with us. Keep her out of the city.

20:19.826 --> 20:24.369
LA Dispatch, this is 621. Put me through
to Frank Reed over at FBI Local.

20:24.456 --> 20:28.999
I've been unable to
reach anyone at the FBI for 45 minutes.

20:29.085 --> 20:30.957
Unable to reach them? Why?

20:31.157 --> 20:34.756
Lot of traffic on their
lines for some reason.

20:34.841 --> 20:37.759
Keep trying.
Give me a call when you get through.

20:37.844 --> 20:39.920
Copy that.

20:41.056 --> 20:43.511
What the hell is going on?

20:57.280 --> 21:00.484
- How did it go with Wieland?
- He's not gonna play ball.

21:00.575 --> 21:03.245
He thinks he's got the upper hand.

21:03.328 --> 21:05.819
He knows we have to let him go eventually.

21:05.914 --> 21:09.959
Whether there's a legal precedent
for this or not, he has a hell of a story.

21:10.043 --> 21:13.210
I'm so sorry, David.
I thought I could charm him.

21:15.215 --> 21:18.086
OK, Sherry. That'll be all.

21:25.100 --> 21:27.425
David?

21:27.519 --> 21:29.891
Why are you treating me like this?

21:29.980 --> 21:35.603
It's not about you. I just have more
important things to deal with right now.

21:39.614 --> 21:41.322
You know,

21:41.408 --> 21:44.362
you've always been able to forgive.

21:44.453 --> 21:49.992
Always given everyone a second chance,
but not me.

21:57.340 --> 22:02.548
I came here today
to tell you that you were right.

22:03.305 --> 22:06.590
Right to kick me off the campaign,

22:07.434 --> 22:10.055
right to file for divorce.

22:11.813 --> 22:14.731
Where's all this coming from?

22:16.568 --> 22:21.645
A place of honesty, of realisation.

22:23.366 --> 22:25.692
I was too caught up in the power.

22:26.703 --> 22:30.452
- And you're not now?
- Of course. You know I love it.

22:30.540 --> 22:34.704
But now I am aware of
what I can and can't handle.

22:35.670 --> 22:38.208
So what are you asking for?

22:42.385 --> 22:44.876
Let me help you.

22:44.971 --> 22:49.598
If what I bring to you can be useful,

22:49.684 --> 22:54.263
then you can consider it
the start of a new confidence.

22:54.356 --> 23:00.145
All right. But I promise you
absolutely nothing in return.

23:01.780 --> 23:03.155
OK.

24:52.307 --> 24:54.888
All right, there are
the transaction records.

24:55.088 --> 24:56.554
On the week of the 23rd,

24:56.645 --> 25:02.101
Reza made four withdrawals from
the company's discretionary account.

25:02.192 --> 25:06.984
$175,000, $150,000,
$50,000, another $50,000...

25:07.072 --> 25:09.942
- That's almost a half a million dollars.
- Yeah.

25:10.033 --> 25:13.034
- What did he do with the money?
- Let's see.

25:14.663 --> 25:20.748
He wrote a check to Syed Ali for $475,000
in return for "consulting services."

25:20.836 --> 25:23.753
So what? Maybe they were doing business.

25:24.381 --> 25:28.758
Syed Ali's only business
is bankrolling terrorists.

25:28.844 --> 25:32.010
What about my father?
What's his connection to all this?

25:32.097 --> 25:35.881
Reza convinced CTU your father
authorised these transactions,

25:35.976 --> 25:39.142
or maybe he just did them on his own.
I'm speculating.

25:39.229 --> 25:44.187
My father is not involved in terrorism.
The government made a mistake.

25:44.276 --> 25:46.601
We have to find it and clear him.

25:49.030 --> 25:53.277
All right. Let's try
and get into his personal calendar.

25:53.368 --> 25:56.322
Let's see what he did
the days the checks were written.

25:56.413 --> 25:58.204
Fine.

25:58.290 --> 25:59.321
OK.

25:59.416 --> 26:02.749
Here's your father's schedule for that week.

26:06.673 --> 26:09.793
- Nothing here, either.
- Of course not.

26:09.885 --> 26:12.376
My father has nothing to do
with any of this.

26:12.471 --> 26:15.637
I shouldn't have called you.
This is a waste of time.

26:15.724 --> 26:19.223
- Wait a minute.
- What?

26:19.311 --> 26:23.522
There's a file in his personal directory
that's accessed almost daily.

26:23.607 --> 26:28.399
It has a resource tab on it,
which means it's a government file.

26:28.487 --> 26:31.737
- My dad has government clients.
- Whoa!

26:31.823 --> 26:34.148
- What?
- It's an auto-delete program.

26:34.242 --> 26:37.029
- Can't you do something?
- Yeah, I'm trying.

26:39.623 --> 26:42.161
- This can't be right.
- What?

26:42.250 --> 26:45.833
The data on this volume has a comsat grid.

26:45.921 --> 26:48.590
You see, these are addresses. CSG14877.

26:48.673 --> 26:53.134
- That's an encoded coordinate.
- I don't know what you're getting at.

26:53.220 --> 26:58.594
The only people who have files like these
have government security clearance.

26:58.683 --> 27:03.760
- Why would my dad have that?
- I don't know.

27:09.778 --> 27:12.296
Why have I been kept
waiting here like this?

27:12.496 --> 27:14.487
Sit down, please, Mr. Warner.

27:14.574 --> 27:16.781
- I have some information.
- Sit down!

27:35.220 --> 27:37.378
What information do you have?

27:38.432 --> 27:41.386
I'm not supposed to
talk to anybody about this,

27:41.476 --> 27:44.263
but under the circumstances...

27:47.941 --> 27:52.270
I am a consultant for the CIA.

27:55.407 --> 28:00.069
There's the contact code for my liaison.
Call Langley, they'll verify.

28:07.335 --> 28:13.089
- Why didn't you tell me this at the house?
- Come on. You know the drill.

28:13.175 --> 28:18.133
I'm not supposed to talk to anyone
about this without clearance.

28:18.221 --> 28:21.175
What's your I-3 protocol?

28:21.266 --> 28:27.470
I was approached about five years ago
because of my international investment work.

28:29.483 --> 28:33.397
They asked me if I'd like to
help my country and I said OK.

28:36.656 --> 28:38.566
What do you do?

28:38.658 --> 28:43.285
My corporation is used as a conduit

28:43.371 --> 28:45.447
to pass information back and forth.

28:46.458 --> 28:49.708
- To whom?
- I don't know.

28:53.924 --> 28:56.249
That is the truth.

28:56.343 --> 28:59.463
Now you listen to me, Mr. Almeida.

28:59.554 --> 29:02.128
I am not an enemy of this country.

29:02.224 --> 29:05.474
I am a patriot. I love my country.

29:06.978 --> 29:13.147
I don't know any Syed Ali, nor why there is
a record of me doing business with him.

29:13.610 --> 29:15.401
Well,

29:15.487 --> 29:19.022
if that's true then you have
nothing to worry about, do you?

29:19.116 --> 29:22.864
But there is a connection
between your company and Syed Ali.

29:22.953 --> 29:26.322
And I'm gonna find out what it is.

29:27.290 --> 29:32.202
So in the meantime, sit tight.
I'm gonna check this out.

29:40.470 --> 29:44.385
- Kimberly Bauer?
- Yes. We need to talk to Jack Bauer.

29:44.474 --> 29:47.890
- He's not here. What's this about?
- His daughter is in custody.

29:47.978 --> 29:50.551
It's important we speak to him immediately.

29:50.647 --> 29:53.814
Hold on. OK.
Laurie, I need you to call downstairs...

29:53.900 --> 29:59.357
George, Bob Warner just told me
he does deliveries for the CIA.

29:59.448 --> 30:01.654
CIA? Did you check it out?

30:01.741 --> 30:07.910
No. I was about to call his liaison, but it
looks like he's got a legitimate contact code.

30:12.627 --> 30:15.712
If that is the case,
then Reza's lying to us.

30:15.797 --> 30:18.371
I don't know. I pushed Reza pretty hard.

30:18.467 --> 30:22.879
- I think he's telling the truth.
- We have to push harder than usual today.

30:22.971 --> 30:26.091
So dig in and see what you can find out.
Let me know.

30:26.183 --> 30:29.599
Mr. Mason? It's the sheriff in Newhall.
They're holding Kim Bauer.

30:29.686 --> 30:32.391
- Why?
- She's been charged with murder.

30:32.481 --> 30:37.819
Call Jack. This is George Mason.
Who am I speaking to?

30:42.949 --> 30:46.365
Bauer.

30:46.453 --> 30:48.113
- It's Michelle.
- What?

30:49.122 --> 30:51.325
Listen, I don't know how to
tell you this but,

30:51.425 --> 30:53.369
we're on the line with
the sheriff in Newhall.

30:53.460 --> 30:55.915
- They're holding Kim.
- For what?

30:56.004 --> 31:00.216
- She's being held on some criminal charges.
- What are you talking about?

31:00.300 --> 31:02.625
She's on the line.
Should I patch her through?

31:02.719 --> 31:04.288
Yes. Get Mason on this now.

31:04.388 --> 31:07.381
I'm on with the precinct Jack.
We're working on it.

31:07.474 --> 31:11.803
There's a mistake. I need you to
straighten it out and get Kim out of LA.

31:11.895 --> 31:14.018
- I'll take care of it.
- Daddy?

31:14.106 --> 31:17.356
- Kim, what happened?
- I was leaving the city, like you said.

31:17.442 --> 31:23.066
I was with Megan and my boyfriend, Miguel.
And the CHP pulled us over for speeding.

31:24.241 --> 31:28.488
They found a body in the trunk.
Carla's body.

31:28.578 --> 31:31.532
- Carla? The woman you work for?
- Yeah.

31:31.623 --> 31:33.131
We took her husband's car.

31:33.231 --> 31:36.534
He must've done it this morning
and put the body in the trunk.

31:36.628 --> 31:38.189
Oh, my God, help me.

31:38.389 --> 31:40.875
Just relax,
we're gonna straighten this out.

31:40.966 --> 31:45.260
He beat her up. That's why I needed
to take Megan. He was hurting her, too.

31:45.345 --> 31:48.631
CTU will send someone.
They'll get you out of there now.

31:49.599 --> 31:56.266
I don't want them to send someone else.
I want you to help me. Can't you do that?

31:56.356 --> 31:58.977
They think I killed Carla, Dad.

32:03.738 --> 32:06.823
Dad, I need you here now.

32:06.908 --> 32:09.316
Hold on a second. Michelle, are you there?

32:09.411 --> 32:11.866
- Yeah.
- What is Faheen saying now?

32:11.955 --> 32:15.656
Nina told him that US forces
have been sent to his village,

32:15.750 --> 32:19.914
that they're rounding up his family.
Faheen called her a liar.

32:20.005 --> 32:21.713
- Dad?
- Kim, hold on.

32:29.806 --> 32:34.018
She just told Faheen that
she has the power to save them.

32:34.102 --> 32:37.056
- Dad?
- Kim, hold on. What are they saying now?

32:43.236 --> 32:46.522
- We can't pick it up. The audio's too low.
- Are you there?

32:46.615 --> 32:51.442
Yeah. George, I need you to help Kim. If you
have to supersede local authority, do it.

32:51.536 --> 32:53.778
- Get her out of LA.
- Done.

32:56.458 --> 32:58.830
Nina, what did he tell you?

33:01.296 --> 33:02.790
Everything.

33:02.881 --> 33:07.044
- No! She just slit his throat!
- Hello?

33:07.135 --> 33:09.709
I got her! Get him on the floor!

33:09.805 --> 33:12.474
Get him on the floor!

33:14.893 --> 33:16.969
Can't stop this.

33:17.979 --> 33:19.474
Dad!

33:20.273 --> 33:23.725
- You got him?
- We're losing him.

33:23.819 --> 33:25.895
Son of a bitch!

33:27.405 --> 33:30.276
- Jack...
- Secure her!

33:30.367 --> 33:34.744
I know where the bomb is.
Take the plane to San Diego.

33:34.830 --> 33:39.622
I want civilian transport to Sao Paolo.
I'll tell you everything when we're down.

33:39.709 --> 33:42.461
- George, are you getting this?
- Yeah, I am.

33:42.546 --> 33:44.503
- He's gone!
- This is your call.

33:44.589 --> 33:47.626
We're out of time.
I don't like being dicked around.

33:47.717 --> 33:50.469
We can bring her into CTU
and press her there.

33:50.554 --> 33:52.491
No. It'll take too long.
Take her to San Diego.

33:52.728 --> 33:53.887
Fine.

33:54.933 --> 33:57.887
- Tell the pilot to go to San Diego.
- You got it.

33:59.855 --> 34:03.105
This is how it works. We land,
you tell me where the bomb is.

34:03.191 --> 34:06.607
We're gonna hold you until
we get a result, you got that?

34:06.695 --> 34:08.687
Got it.

34:26.089 --> 34:29.458
Sir? I may have found something
in the Faheen recordings.

34:29.551 --> 34:31.958
- What'd it say?
- A name.

34:32.053 --> 34:34.379
Marko Khatami. Listen.

34:35.389 --> 34:38.474
...Marko Khatami.

34:39.853 --> 34:44.313
- Did you try cross-referencing?
- Yeah, he's connected to Syed Ali.

34:56.495 --> 34:58.820
- Mr Naiyeer?
- What?

34:59.831 --> 35:02.038
- Who's Marko Khatami?!
- I have no idea!

35:02.125 --> 35:04.450
Who is he?!

35:05.378 --> 35:07.454
Get off!

35:08.590 --> 35:11.840
- Somebody help me.
- You're crazy!

35:13.804 --> 35:18.181
- You're mad!
- Just cool it! Cool down!

35:19.893 --> 35:21.969
Let me go.

35:28.985 --> 35:32.520
- Are we being released?
- No. You're being transferred.

35:32.614 --> 35:34.939
- To where?
- I don't know.

35:35.033 --> 35:36.533
Someone from CTU called.

35:37.433 --> 35:40.075
Said they were coming to pick
you up and take over the case.

35:40.163 --> 35:43.947
What about Megan?
You brought her back here, right?

35:44.042 --> 35:47.910
- What's gonna happen to her?
- It's none of your business.

35:48.004 --> 35:50.542
You can't take her back to LA!

35:56.680 --> 35:58.756
You listen to me.

36:00.058 --> 36:02.466
I checked you out.
Your father works for CTU.

36:02.561 --> 36:06.808
You tell me, what did he tell you
would happen today in LA?

36:06.898 --> 36:11.145
I can't say anything,
but you can't take Megan back.

36:11.236 --> 36:13.727
Just tell me what's going on.

36:22.372 --> 36:24.365
It's a nuclear bomb.

36:28.670 --> 36:32.798
They didn't say anything
because they don't want to start a panic.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.260
OK.

37:00.202 --> 37:03.053
Did you get anything
else off the recording?

37:03.253 --> 37:04.579
It's 99% noise.

37:07.918 --> 37:11.666
- You OK?
- Just running on empty.

37:13.507 --> 37:18.667
- Then why don't you get something to eat?
- No, I'm fine.

37:18.762 --> 37:20.838
Your neck's bleeding here.

37:23.600 --> 37:25.758
It's somebody else's blood.

37:33.276 --> 37:35.847
Michelle, why don't you take a few minutes,

37:35.947 --> 37:39.694
get cleaned up and changed.
You'll feel better.

37:44.037 --> 37:46.030
Hey.

37:46.706 --> 37:48.995
We're gonna survive this day.

37:50.293 --> 37:52.369
All right?

37:54.047 --> 37:57.250
Come on, get changed. Come on.

38:07.352 --> 38:10.057
Mr. President?

38:12.482 --> 38:17.477
These are the updated guidelines Stanton
sent to local law enforcement and the FBI.

38:19.114 --> 38:24.274
- I understand Sherry ran into Stanton.
- I didn't hear that.

38:24.369 --> 38:27.536
Has he said anything to you
about her being here?

38:29.875 --> 38:34.335
- I don't think he's very happy about it.
- Do you have a problem with her?

38:34.421 --> 38:38.253
- I know you think she's useful to you.
- That's not what I asked.

38:39.092 --> 38:44.466
I welcome help wherever we can get it.
If you feel she performs a function here...

38:44.556 --> 38:47.640
- Sir, you better come out here.
- What is it, Mike?

38:52.731 --> 38:58.187
I've confirmed that there is an imminent threat
to national security and public safety.

38:58.278 --> 39:01.896
While I cannot confirm the target
or nature of the attack,

39:01.990 --> 39:08.443
it may come from Middle Eastern terrorists,
but terrorists in the US may also be involved.

39:08.538 --> 39:09.949
How did he get out?

39:10.040 --> 39:15.200
What I find troubling about this story
is our president knows about this threat

39:15.295 --> 39:18.166
and isn't saying anything to the public.

39:18.256 --> 39:21.708
- Who was controlling that room?
- Armus.

39:21.802 --> 39:24.257
I want to see him now.

39:29.309 --> 39:33.686
It doesn't make sense. If my father
really does work for the government,

39:33.772 --> 39:39.015
which is impossible to believe, wouldn't
he know if Reza did something illegal?

39:39.111 --> 39:42.065
I'd think so,
especially if terrorism was involved.

39:42.155 --> 39:44.860
If he knew about Reza, what does that mean?

39:44.950 --> 39:50.739
My guess is your father was aware that Reza
was involved in some kind of illegal activity.

39:50.831 --> 39:55.457
- He was monitoring him for some reason.
- But that doesn't make sense either.

39:55.544 --> 40:00.040
My father would not let someone
he was investigating marry Marie.

40:00.132 --> 40:03.832
He got upset if anyone made
any critical remark about Reza.

40:03.927 --> 40:09.266
- He treated him like a son.
- I know Agent Almeida at CTU pretty well.

40:09.349 --> 40:12.683
I'll give him a call
and see if we could find out...

40:33.248 --> 40:35.324
Go! Go!

40:50.640 --> 40:54.472
The Sunday before you killed my wife,

40:54.561 --> 40:57.597
Teri and I went down to
the boardwalk in Venice.

40:58.982 --> 41:02.643
Just watching all the
rollerbladers and musicians,

41:02.743 --> 41:05.234
laughing at the crazy people...

41:09.159 --> 41:11.235
Just spending time together.

41:13.955 --> 41:16.707
And Teri sees this snow-cone stand.

41:19.669 --> 41:21.876
She giggles like a kid,

41:21.963 --> 41:26.460
she takes off running and she
wants to get in line, she wants one.

41:26.551 --> 41:29.885
I remember I was watching her...

41:31.181 --> 41:33.470
I couldn't help myself.

41:34.643 --> 41:40.099
She was talking with an old lady in line
behind her. The two of them were laughing.

41:40.190 --> 41:43.938
I remember thinking to myself
"How the hell does she do that?"

41:45.070 --> 41:49.020
"How does she strike up
a conversation with an absolute stranger?"

41:49.116 --> 41:54.276
And they just started laughing
like they'd been friends forever.

41:57.666 --> 41:59.742
That's a gift.

42:01.378 --> 42:06.123
I remember thinking "God,
I wish I could do that." But I can't.

42:08.760 --> 42:10.836
That was Teri.

42:13.140 --> 42:15.216
My wife.

42:17.436 --> 42:20.353
That's what you took from this world.

42:23.316 --> 42:26.602
That's what you took
from me and my daughter.

42:33.452 --> 42:35.907
I just wanted you to know that.

42:49.259 --> 42:51.501
We got a man down!

42:52.305 --> 42:58.719
