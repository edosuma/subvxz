WEBVTT

00:06.963 --> 00:08.704
- Hey.
- Thanks for coming.

00:08.747 --> 00:10.140
Hospital food, I know.

00:10.184 --> 00:11.881
But the French toast
is surprisingly good.

00:11.924 --> 00:13.883
Not at all. Let's do it.

00:13.926 --> 00:16.277
Okay. But first...

00:16.320 --> 00:18.105
I have a little
something for you.

00:18.148 --> 00:20.759
What are these?

00:23.023 --> 00:25.025
Airline tickets to Honolulu.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.896
For our wedding.

00:26.939 --> 00:28.941
Where you wanted to go
first time around, remember?

00:28.985 --> 00:31.596
But we couldn't afford it.

00:31.640 --> 00:36.210
Danny, that is so sweet.
Thank you.

00:36.253 --> 00:37.863
I don't know what to say.

00:37.907 --> 00:40.518
How about, um, aloha?

00:42.955 --> 00:45.436
Honolulu! Take that.

00:45.480 --> 00:47.003
- Whoa.
- What?

00:47.047 --> 00:49.353
What's this?

00:49.397 --> 00:51.268
Um, Robin gave it to me.

00:51.312 --> 00:53.357
I don't really need it
but you know...

00:53.401 --> 00:55.272
it makes her happy
so I'm going to do it.

00:55.316 --> 00:59.450
Come on, French toast.
Come on, Waikiki!

00:59.494 --> 01:01.385
Finally you're going
to learn how to surf, right?

01:01.409 --> 01:03.541
Remember you've just
had abdominal surgery

01:03.585 --> 01:05.587
so be patient.
It takes a while to recover.

01:05.630 --> 01:08.111
You need to be ambulatory.
Walk every day.

01:08.155 --> 01:09.678
But don't push it.

01:09.721 --> 01:10.809
Got it.

01:10.853 --> 01:12.507
Great to see
you two back together.

01:12.550 --> 01:15.075
I like to think it was
because of Bernie and me.

01:15.118 --> 01:16.598
Whatever.

01:16.641 --> 01:18.315
You know, when you go through
something like this,

01:18.339 --> 01:20.428
makes you appreciate
everything you have.

01:20.471 --> 01:23.648
Good friends, a wonderful
woman, a brand new baby.

01:23.692 --> 01:25.781
Not to mention a wife
and teenage daughter.

01:25.824 --> 01:27.696
- Ethan.
- I know, I know.

01:27.739 --> 01:29.567
But we're working something out.

01:29.611 --> 01:33.093
I promise I'm going to
take good care of your sister.

01:33.136 --> 01:35.225
I look forward
to hearing your plans.

01:40.926 --> 01:43.407
Connor...

01:48.630 --> 01:50.762
I hope you know I did everything

01:50.806 --> 01:52.764
I could for your father.

01:52.808 --> 01:54.375
I do.

01:57.334 --> 01:59.293
I'm here for you.

02:02.296 --> 02:05.951
If there's...
If there's anything I can do.

02:05.995 --> 02:08.215
Thank you.

02:18.573 --> 02:21.663
Hey, Nina.

02:21.706 --> 02:24.535
Are you doing
the autopsy on my dad?

02:24.579 --> 02:27.973
Yes, um...

02:28.017 --> 02:29.888
before I start, maybe you...

02:29.932 --> 02:32.326
want some time with him?

02:32.369 --> 02:35.981
Yeah, please. Thank you.

02:50.213 --> 02:52.998
I hated you.

02:56.393 --> 03:00.745
I blamed you for Mom's death.
I blamed you for...

03:00.789 --> 03:04.140
so many things.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.535
Maybe I was seeing it all wrong.

03:07.578 --> 03:11.321
You weren't the best dad.

03:11.365 --> 03:16.108
But maybe if I'd
been a better son...

03:16.152 --> 03:18.720
you'd have been a better father.

03:21.026 --> 03:23.855
Man, I...

03:23.899 --> 03:27.076
I'm sorry.

03:47.705 --> 03:49.751
Remember our cochlear implant
patient Peter Rush?

03:49.794 --> 03:51.187
Yeah. Usher Syndrome.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.102
Why, is he back?
Is his eyesight worse?

03:53.145 --> 03:54.712
Yes, but that's
not why he's here.

03:54.756 --> 03:56.801
It's his wife, Bonnie.

03:56.845 --> 03:59.804
- This way.
- Okay.

04:02.372 --> 04:03.678
Hello, Bonnie.

04:03.721 --> 04:06.463
- Who's that?
- Dr. Manning.

04:06.507 --> 04:10.032
- Sorry. I don't see too well.
- No need to apologize.

04:10.075 --> 04:13.035
Congratulations
on your marriage.

04:13.078 --> 04:15.255
So what seems to be the trouble?

04:16.168 --> 04:17.581
She says she doesn't
need to be here.

04:17.605 --> 04:19.171
There's nothing wrong with her.

04:19.214 --> 04:22.479
I made her come.
Her heart doesn't sound right.

04:22.523 --> 04:24.002
Doesn't sound right?

04:24.046 --> 04:28.311
I had my head on her chest.
I heard it.

04:28.355 --> 04:31.358
May I?

04:37.364 --> 04:41.498
You heard right.
Sounds like a systolic murmur.

04:41.542 --> 04:44.327
Do you ever feel dizzy
or out of breath?

04:45.850 --> 04:47.548
Yes, you do.

04:47.591 --> 04:49.158
Let's get her on the monitors.

04:49.201 --> 04:51.987
Need a CBC, BMP, cardiac labs,
a D-Dimer, chest x-ray...

04:52.030 --> 04:54.032
And a 12-lead EKG
and a cardiac echo.

04:54.076 --> 04:55.947
Right.

04:57.862 --> 05:01.170
She's saying sorry,
he was right.

05:01.213 --> 05:03.215
We'll be back
when we get the results.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.089
Dan.

05:07.132 --> 05:08.743
I got a patient of yours,
Delmar Brendl.

05:08.786 --> 05:10.266
Yeah, he won't let me

05:10.310 --> 05:12.094
treat him unless
you're in the room.

05:15.750 --> 05:18.579
- Hey, Del.
- Dr. Charles, I'm fine.

05:18.622 --> 05:20.861
I really don't need to be here.
He was found at the bottom

05:20.885 --> 05:22.341
of his stairs
at his apartment building.

05:22.365 --> 05:24.125
- I didn't get hurt.
- But he couldn't get up.

05:24.149 --> 05:25.890
The manager called
the paramedics.

05:25.934 --> 05:28.260
Well, Del's been a patient
of mine for a couple years now.

05:28.284 --> 05:30.721
I'm treating him for
generalized anxiety disorder,

05:30.765 --> 05:32.854
panic attacks,
and making some real progress.

05:32.897 --> 05:34.397
Mr. Brendl, why weren't you
able to get up?

05:34.421 --> 05:37.728
I don't know.
My right leg is a little weak.

05:37.772 --> 05:40.165
And my left. And my left arm.

05:40.209 --> 05:42.864
- Anything else bothering you?
- You mean like the headaches?

05:42.907 --> 05:44.779
Everybody gets headaches, right?

05:44.822 --> 05:48.130
Do me a favor. Put your feet up.

05:52.482 --> 05:55.180
Flex your foot like you're
stepping on the gas.

05:55.224 --> 05:56.965
The other side.

05:57.008 --> 05:58.967
Your left side's weaker.
Yeah, I know.

05:59.010 --> 06:00.795
I told you that.
It's no big deal.

06:00.838 --> 06:05.060
Monique, let's get a 12-lead
EKG, CT head, CTLS spine and...

06:05.103 --> 06:06.453
No needles. I hate needles.

06:06.496 --> 06:08.019
And cardiac labs.

06:08.063 --> 06:09.847
You can totally do this, Del.

06:09.891 --> 06:11.936
Gonna be over in a flash,
I promise you.

06:11.980 --> 06:12.981
That really hurts!

06:13.024 --> 06:14.504
I haven't done anything.

06:14.548 --> 06:15.940
Here. Del, Del. Look at me.

06:15.984 --> 06:17.507
Right here, all right.
Doing great.

06:17.551 --> 06:19.814
In through the nose.

06:19.857 --> 06:21.903
Out through the mouth.
Gonna be fine.

06:23.774 --> 06:25.863
When we woke up,
I looked over and Henry

06:25.907 --> 06:27.387
had this rash all over.

06:27.430 --> 06:29.389
- Okay if I look in your mouth?
- Sure.

06:31.565 --> 06:32.740
It's clear.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.045
- Any trouble breathing?
- No.

06:34.089 --> 06:36.918
Mr. Kupfer
puts out a star for Christmas.

06:36.961 --> 06:39.442
Yes he does, Joanie.
Honey, give us a second.

06:39.486 --> 06:42.445
We're talking to the doctor.

06:42.489 --> 06:44.229
It's Alzheimer's.

06:44.273 --> 06:46.362
Well, your rash... it's hives.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.122
Pretty sure you're having
an allergic reaction.

06:48.146 --> 06:49.191
To what?

06:49.234 --> 06:50.671
He doesn't have any allergies.

06:50.714 --> 06:52.412
People can develop them
at any age.

06:52.455 --> 06:54.892
April, let's give Mr. Wilks
50 milligrams of Benadryl IV,

06:54.936 --> 06:56.807
150 milligrams of Zantac IV.

06:56.851 --> 07:00.115
Also, let's get a CBC and BMP
and send a UA for tox and EO's.

07:00.158 --> 07:03.118
Standard blood
and urine tests. Fist.

07:03.161 --> 07:04.815
Let's see if the antihistamines

07:04.859 --> 07:06.489
get rid of your rash,
make you feel better.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.689
I'm afraid your husband's going
to be here a few hours.

07:08.732 --> 07:10.734
I'm not his wife.

07:11.561 --> 07:13.041
Joanie's my wife.

07:13.084 --> 07:16.523
- Am I sick?
- No, honey, you're fine.

07:16.566 --> 07:18.438
It's Henry.

07:21.136 --> 07:25.488
I'll check back in a little bit.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.403
Excuse me.

07:29.187 --> 07:31.886
- Dad.
- Hi, honey.

07:31.929 --> 07:33.670
Hey, I need to talk to you.

07:33.714 --> 07:34.889
Shoot.

07:34.932 --> 07:37.587
Wedding in Hawaii?

07:37.631 --> 07:38.980
Right.

07:39.023 --> 07:41.199
Dad, do you really think
this is a good idea?

07:42.462 --> 07:43.917
Honey, it's what your mom
always wanted.

07:43.941 --> 07:46.074
- Yeah, I know but...
- Trust me.

07:46.117 --> 07:48.424
She was delighted. Delighted.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.730
Yeah, of course she was.

07:49.773 --> 07:51.688
I mean, she wouldn't want
to disappoint you.

07:51.732 --> 07:53.734
- What do you mean?
- Mom is thrilled

07:53.777 --> 07:57.128
about the wedding, but...
she's not well.

07:57.172 --> 07:59.740
She can't handle
a trip to Hawaii.

07:59.783 --> 08:01.524
She's gonna have
a couple mai tais

08:01.568 --> 08:03.744
and sleep the whole flight.
Then once we get there

08:03.787 --> 08:05.920
she's not lifting a finger
'cause it's first class

08:05.963 --> 08:08.270
all the way.
You have my word on that.

08:08.313 --> 08:09.619
Charles.

08:09.663 --> 08:11.491
Mr. Brendl's cardiac labs
came back negative.

08:11.534 --> 08:13.144
But his head CT showed

08:13.188 --> 08:15.079
a frontal mass with focal edema
and midline shift.

08:15.103 --> 08:17.192
- A tumor?
- Very possibly.

08:17.235 --> 08:19.760
Neurosurgery and Neurology
want a stat MRI.

08:19.803 --> 08:21.283
I mean,
he's really claustrophobic.

08:21.326 --> 08:23.851
The CT was bad enough,
now with all the banging?

08:23.894 --> 08:27.028
He'll jump out of his skin.

08:33.774 --> 08:36.558
Ingrid, got your text.

08:36.602 --> 08:39.169
What is it?
I just got some news, Will.

08:39.214 --> 08:41.433
Tim Burke... he's out of prison.

08:43.347 --> 08:44.393
Already?

08:44.436 --> 08:45.960
He only got a two-year sentence.

08:46.003 --> 08:48.832
Model prisoner, no priors.
He's out on parole.

08:48.876 --> 08:51.052
- Should I be worried?
- Will...

08:51.095 --> 08:53.141
You are responsible
for his father

08:53.184 --> 08:56.013
and his brother being
incarcerated.

08:56.057 --> 08:57.624
This is hard for me to say,
but...

08:57.667 --> 09:00.583
I think the safest thing
would be for you to relocate.

09:00.627 --> 09:01.845
Out of state.

09:09.810 --> 09:11.638
The purpose
of the Glenn procedure

09:11.681 --> 09:12.876
is to improve
Sophie's oxygenation

09:12.900 --> 09:15.076
and reduce pulmonary
artery pressure.

09:15.119 --> 09:17.426
- Any questions?
- No.

09:17.469 --> 09:19.428
The operation
is not without risk,

09:19.471 --> 09:22.605
particularly in light
of Sophie's previous surgery.

09:22.649 --> 09:25.347
Each time you open the chest,
it becomes more difficult.

09:25.390 --> 09:28.611
We expect Sophie's adhesions
to be extensive.

09:28.655 --> 09:31.658
But we're optimistic.
She's a strong little girl.

09:31.701 --> 09:35.400
Okay, thank you.

09:36.706 --> 09:39.753
Hey, you're doing great.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.668
They're great surgeons, Phillip.

09:41.711 --> 09:43.321
Sophie's in the very best hands.

09:43.365 --> 09:48.631
You know, it might just be
because you're here, but um...

09:48.675 --> 09:51.808
I just think that everything's
going to work out.

09:53.027 --> 09:54.985
Yeah.

09:58.336 --> 10:00.512
It's terrible!

10:00.556 --> 10:03.994
God, that was terrible.
That was terrible.

10:04.038 --> 10:08.129
The banging. God.

10:08.172 --> 10:10.392
J-just get me out of here, man.
You did great.

10:10.435 --> 10:11.785
Absolutely great.

10:11.828 --> 10:14.962
Del, this is Dr. Abrams.
He is a neurosurgeon.

10:15.005 --> 10:16.485
Best one in Chicago.

10:16.528 --> 10:17.878
If not the entire United States.

10:17.921 --> 10:20.228
- My mistake.
- S-surgeon?

10:20.271 --> 10:21.490
Yeah, you have a tumor.

10:21.533 --> 10:23.144
A frontoparietal
convexity meningioma.

10:23.187 --> 10:25.799
- I have a tumor in my brain?
- That's where the weakness

10:25.842 --> 10:27.365
is coming from. But Dr. Abrams

10:27.409 --> 10:28.845
is pretty sure that it's benign.

10:28.889 --> 10:30.847
- And operable.
- Okay.

10:30.891 --> 10:33.415
Okay, just knock me out
and let's get it over with.

10:33.458 --> 10:34.764
Here's the thing.

10:34.808 --> 10:36.679
Because of the location
of the tumor,

10:36.723 --> 10:40.074
it's going to have to be what
we call an awake procedure.

10:40.117 --> 10:41.336
Awake?

10:41.379 --> 10:42.772
Yeah, not the entire procedure.

10:42.816 --> 10:44.402
You'll be anesthetized
but then at a certain point

10:44.426 --> 10:45.664
we'll have to lower the sedation

10:45.688 --> 10:47.385
so I can monitor
your motor functions.

10:47.429 --> 10:48.952
So I'll just...

10:48.996 --> 10:50.713
be lying there awake
with the top of my skull off?

10:50.737 --> 10:52.956
- Yeah, more or less.
- I know it sounds extreme,

10:53.000 --> 10:54.958
but it's actually
remarkably common.

10:55.002 --> 10:58.005
No, forget it.
I-I'm not doing that.

10:58.048 --> 11:00.747
Okay.

11:00.790 --> 11:03.750
Um... wait here,
I'll be right back.

11:07.231 --> 11:08.406
Sam!

11:08.450 --> 11:09.930
Dan, he said no.

11:09.973 --> 11:11.279
I'm not going to twist his arm.

11:11.322 --> 11:12.584
I'll talk to him.

11:12.628 --> 11:13.779
What? The guy's a terrible risk.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.041
What if he flips out in surgery?

11:15.065 --> 11:16.240
He could herniate.

11:16.284 --> 11:18.025
If he does that,
I'll calm him down.

11:18.068 --> 11:20.592
Really? I'd say you've done
a piss poor job of that so far.

11:20.636 --> 11:22.116
Sam, come on.

11:22.159 --> 11:24.553
If you don't operate,
that tumor's going to kill him.

11:27.077 --> 11:30.559
All right, if you get him
to agree, page me.

11:45.792 --> 11:48.969
- Looking for a job?
- No.

11:49.012 --> 11:50.492
Just curious.

11:50.535 --> 11:51.754
There's a lot of jobs

11:51.798 --> 11:53.756
for E.D. docs out there,
you know?

11:55.802 --> 11:58.195
Well, hey, nice to know
you're wanted, right?

11:58.239 --> 12:00.110
Let's go.

12:07.074 --> 12:09.076
Bonnie, Peter.

12:09.119 --> 12:12.166
This is Dr. Latham, our chief
of cardiothoracic surgery.

12:12.209 --> 12:14.255
He's made a diagnosis.

12:15.082 --> 12:19.782
Your cardiac echo shows
a condition which is...

12:19.826 --> 12:22.263
Why don't you let me sign?

12:22.306 --> 12:24.265
With your permission, of course.

12:24.308 --> 12:25.570
You know ASL?

12:25.614 --> 12:27.113
I try to learn
a new language every year.

12:27.137 --> 12:29.444
This year it's Hindi,
last year ASL.

12:29.487 --> 12:32.839
It's an elegant language.
Correct me if I make a mistake.

12:32.882 --> 12:34.579
Okay.

12:36.277 --> 12:39.497
Your cardiac echo shows

12:39.541 --> 12:43.284
a condition associated
with hearing loss.

12:43.327 --> 12:46.940
Mitral valve prolapse.

12:46.983 --> 12:48.985
Is it serious?

12:50.160 --> 12:52.815
The leaflets
of your mitral valve

12:52.859 --> 12:57.037
bulge when your heart
contracts, allowing

12:57.080 --> 13:00.301
blood to leak back
into your atrium.

13:00.344 --> 13:06.002
I can repair with minimally
invasive surgery.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.659
She's asking if
she really needs it.

13:10.702 --> 13:13.749
She doesn't feel that bad.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.838
It's better to do it before
you feel really sick.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.797
- There's less risk.
- Yeah.

13:17.840 --> 13:20.364
And you're in danger
of getting endocarditis.

13:20.408 --> 13:22.671
It's a heart infection.

13:25.805 --> 13:26.999
He's asking if he can go ahead

13:27.023 --> 13:29.112
and schedule the procedure.

13:38.078 --> 13:41.211
- Mr. Wilks' test results.
- Wife's got Alzheimer's

13:41.255 --> 13:43.518
but, hey, why should
that slow you down?

13:43.561 --> 13:45.999
Go out, get another woman...

13:46.042 --> 13:47.522
have her come live with you.

13:47.565 --> 13:49.002
It's really nice, Ethan,

13:49.045 --> 13:51.178
when we actually agree
on something.

13:52.005 --> 13:54.137
Yeah.

13:57.053 --> 13:59.012
Hey, Mr. Wilks.
How are you feeling?

13:59.055 --> 14:02.015
- Better, thanks.
- I see your hives are fading.

14:02.058 --> 14:04.104
And as I thought
your blood work is normal.

14:04.147 --> 14:05.845
I do recommend
you see an allergist

14:05.888 --> 14:07.803
to figure out what
you were sensitive to.

14:07.847 --> 14:12.068
- I will.
- I will start your discharge.

14:12.112 --> 14:13.983
While you're waiting,
I'll get Joanie a bite.

14:14.027 --> 14:15.637
- Pick me up something too.
- Okay.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.857
Come on, Joanie.
How about some scrambled eggs?

14:17.900 --> 14:20.947
- Scrambled eggs!
- Yes!

14:27.605 --> 14:29.042
Dr. Rhodes...

14:29.085 --> 14:31.914
Sophie just went up
for a pre-op.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.002
Good.

14:33.046 --> 14:36.353
Yeah... can I ask you something?

14:36.397 --> 14:38.138
You've known Natalie
for a while.

14:38.181 --> 14:41.968
I mean, yeah, we've worked
together for a few years.

14:43.578 --> 14:47.364
So...

14:47.408 --> 14:50.585
what do you think?

14:50.628 --> 14:53.544
Will she like it?

14:53.588 --> 14:55.807
Um...

14:55.851 --> 14:59.289
it's a very nice ring.

15:01.639 --> 15:04.599
Yeah, right, well...

15:04.642 --> 15:10.474
I'd only propose if
everything goes well.

15:10.518 --> 15:15.479
- Right.
- Right. Um...

15:15.523 --> 15:18.569
Thanks, man.

15:25.228 --> 15:26.316
Will, I need you.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.101
They're bringing in
Sydney Hawkins.

15:28.144 --> 15:29.929
- Your kidney recipient?
- Yeah.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.495
You're going to Baghdad.

15:31.539 --> 15:35.108
Sydney Hawkins, mid-30s,
kidney transplant. GCS 15.

15:35.151 --> 15:39.286
Sats at 95.

15:39.329 --> 15:41.201
Complaining of flu-like
symptoms, edema,

15:41.244 --> 15:42.985
and left lower quadrant
abdominal pain.

15:43.029 --> 15:45.118
Maggie...

15:45.161 --> 15:46.380
I'm sorry.

15:46.423 --> 15:47.990
Sorry for what, Sydney?

15:48.034 --> 15:50.775
I... I'm nothing but trouble.

15:50.819 --> 15:52.473
No, you're not. Don't say that.

15:52.516 --> 15:55.476
On my count. One, two, three!

15:55.519 --> 15:59.480
Four liters nasal O2,
stat chest x-ray, CBC, BMP,

15:59.523 --> 16:01.134
cyclospirine
and renal ultrasound.

16:01.177 --> 16:02.613
Right.

16:02.657 --> 16:04.485
Get a non-contrast
CT abdomen and pelvis.

16:04.528 --> 16:05.766
Take a look
at her kidney as well.

16:05.790 --> 16:06.922
She seems pretty uremic.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.890
Sidney Hawkins.

16:18.934 --> 16:21.981
Looks like she might
be rejecting my kidney.

16:22.024 --> 16:25.201
Maggie, I'm so sorry.

16:30.685 --> 16:34.036
Help, help! Henry can't breathe!

16:34.080 --> 16:35.298
Somebody!

16:35.342 --> 16:36.884
He was just eating
a sandwich and suddenly...

16:36.908 --> 16:38.060
He's having
an allergic reaction.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.694
I've got to look in your mouth.

16:39.737 --> 16:41.193
All right, tongue's swollen.
He's got hives in his mouth.

16:41.217 --> 16:43.045
- Epi?
- Yeah, .3 milligrams IM

16:43.089 --> 16:46.527
and 125 of Solu-Medrol IV stat.
Let's get him on oxygen.

16:46.570 --> 16:47.658
Another round of epi.

16:49.878 --> 16:51.053
Sat's at 86. He's tripoding.

16:51.097 --> 16:52.881
All right, he's in anaphylaxis.

16:52.924 --> 16:54.206
I've got to intubate
before his airway closes.

16:54.230 --> 16:56.667
20 of etomidate, 100 of sux.

17:07.461 --> 17:09.332
I'm in.

17:09.376 --> 17:10.855
Bag him.

17:16.948 --> 17:18.863
89... they're coming up.

17:18.906 --> 17:20.082
BP and heart rate are okay.

17:20.126 --> 17:22.040
- He's stable.
- Thank God!

17:22.084 --> 17:25.087
My God, whatwhatwhat
could've caused this?

17:25.131 --> 17:28.395
- What did he eat?
- It was a roast beef sandwich.

17:30.614 --> 17:32.181
Wait, where's Joanie?

17:33.791 --> 17:35.445
Where is she?

17:35.489 --> 17:37.143
Hey, did you see
a woman leave this room

17:37.186 --> 17:40.624
just a minute ago?
Yes, she's headed outside.

17:50.808 --> 17:53.463
Joanie!

17:53.507 --> 17:54.812
My God!

18:02.690 --> 18:06.041
Joanie!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:06.085 --> 18:08.913
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:08.957 --> 18:11.394
Lots of cars.

18:11.438 --> 18:13.004
Let's get you where it's safe.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.747
Honey! Honey!

18:16.791 --> 18:18.227
Honey.

18:18.271 --> 18:20.142
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

18:20.186 --> 18:22.275
Okay.

18:23.145 --> 18:24.755
Connor.

18:26.409 --> 18:27.976
Hey, Nina, what's up?

18:29.151 --> 18:32.111
Your father didn't have
a history of diabetes, did he?

18:32.154 --> 18:34.243
No, why?

18:34.287 --> 18:38.900
He died from
an overdose of insulin.

18:38.943 --> 18:41.163
Insulin.
That doesn't make any sense.

18:41.207 --> 18:42.599
It was synthetic.

18:42.643 --> 18:45.689
Someone in the hospital
gave it to him.

18:45.733 --> 18:48.301
I have to label
his death suspicious.

18:56.178 --> 18:57.527
So were they able to determine

18:57.571 --> 19:00.008
your father's cause of death?

19:03.359 --> 19:04.969
No, not yet.

19:05.013 --> 19:06.884
Such a sudden arrhythmia.

19:06.928 --> 19:09.844
I'd have to guess
it was a pulmonary embolism.

19:09.887 --> 19:12.281
- Dr. Rhodes...
- She's bleeding. Suction.

19:12.325 --> 19:13.543
Suction.

19:13.587 --> 19:15.154
It's coming from
her right atrium.

19:15.197 --> 19:16.696
The adhesions from the
sternum must've torn it open.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.983
Dammit.
Let's do a sucker bypass.

19:19.027 --> 19:20.246
Sats are down to 52.

19:20.289 --> 19:23.249
11 blade and an aortic cannula.

19:30.430 --> 19:32.606
And...

19:32.649 --> 19:36.000
- I'm in.
- Sats are up to 76.

19:36.044 --> 19:38.394
80...

19:40.570 --> 19:44.095
Prolene stitch
for the SVC cannula.

19:56.891 --> 19:59.372
Time to wake him up. You ready?

19:59.415 --> 20:01.852
- Yes, sir.
- Lighten his sedation.

20:09.295 --> 20:10.948
Maggie?

20:10.992 --> 20:13.908
Sydney's scans came back.
There's a tumor on her kidney.

20:13.951 --> 20:16.606
That's what's been causing
her kidney failure.

20:16.650 --> 20:19.218
A tumor? Cancer?

20:19.261 --> 20:20.436
It looks that way.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.133
We'll know more
after the biopsy.

20:22.177 --> 20:24.048
God, I gave her a bad kidney.

20:24.092 --> 20:26.877
No, no, they examined
your kidney thoroughly.

20:26.921 --> 20:29.402
There was no sign of a tumor.

20:29.445 --> 20:33.144
Sydney clearly developed
it after her transplant.

20:33.188 --> 20:35.277
As if her life
wasn't hard enough.

20:35.321 --> 20:39.150
Well, let's hope they
get it all and she recovers.

20:41.283 --> 20:44.547
Sydney?

20:44.591 --> 20:47.637
Do you understand
what's happening?

20:47.681 --> 20:49.509
They're trying to make me well.

20:49.552 --> 20:51.119
That's right.

20:51.162 --> 20:54.427
We're all just
trying to make you well.

20:54.470 --> 20:57.168
Thank you.

20:57.212 --> 20:58.996
Go ahead.

21:20.104 --> 21:23.020
I've excised the misshapen
section of the valve.

21:23.064 --> 21:25.501
I'm starting now to reconstruct.

21:38.253 --> 21:42.736
Surgery's going well.
No surprises.

21:44.172 --> 21:46.827
What were we thinking?

21:48.350 --> 21:51.614
What's going on?

21:51.658 --> 21:56.532
Bonnie and I,
we talked about having a baby.

21:56.576 --> 21:58.752
So stupid.

21:58.795 --> 22:02.321
Me going blind...
Bonnie with her heart...

22:02.364 --> 22:06.542
- Her heart's going to be fine.
- But what next?

22:10.416 --> 22:13.462
You know, Peter, none of us
get any guarantees in life.

22:13.506 --> 22:18.162
We all just... face what comes.

22:18.206 --> 22:23.516
I look at you and Bonnie
and I think you two do great.

22:23.559 --> 22:25.648
I think you two can handle
almost anything.

22:31.785 --> 22:34.178
Mr. Brendl, can you hear me?

22:34.222 --> 22:36.093
- Who's that?
- That's Dr. Abrams.

22:36.137 --> 22:38.705
You're in surgery, Del,
and it's going great.

22:38.748 --> 22:40.881
I need to map different
pathways in your brain

22:40.924 --> 22:42.578
so I'll be touching
certain areas

22:42.622 --> 22:44.493
and asking you to respond
to my questions.

22:44.537 --> 22:46.756
Count to five for me.

22:48.889 --> 22:50.194
One.

22:50.238 --> 22:52.414
Two.

22:52.458 --> 22:55.243
So the top of my skull is off?
A portion of it, yes.

22:55.286 --> 22:58.420
We talked about that, too.
Continue counting.

22:58.464 --> 23:01.641
- My brain is just exposed?
- Del, you've got this.

23:01.684 --> 23:03.860
Deep breaths, okay?
In through the nose...

23:03.904 --> 23:07.037
Out through the mouth.

23:07.081 --> 23:08.561
Three.

23:08.604 --> 23:10.127
Four.

23:10.171 --> 23:12.086
No, I want to stop.
Make him stop.

23:12.129 --> 23:14.218
Del, it's okay.
You're doing great.

23:14.262 --> 23:15.872
You got me into this.
Get me out?

23:15.916 --> 23:17.831
- Stop squirming.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

23:17.874 --> 23:19.461
Del, look at me.
Right here, right here.

23:19.485 --> 23:21.245
His breathing is too shallow.
He's retaining CO2.

23:21.269 --> 23:23.663
- His brain's going to swell.
- Get me out, get me out!

23:23.706 --> 23:25.229
Either you do something

23:25.273 --> 23:29.103
or I'm going to re-sedate
and end this.

23:32.802 --> 23:35.326
Please, please,
I can't stand it!

23:35.370 --> 23:36.782
Okay, Del. I need you to tell
me, how are your feet?

23:36.806 --> 23:38.349
Can you feel your feet?
I can't, I can't!

23:38.373 --> 23:39.418
Dan!

23:39.461 --> 23:40.656
Del, I'm touching
your right foot.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.333
Can you feel me touching
your right foot?

23:42.377 --> 23:43.615
Yeah, I can feel it.
Can we please stop?

23:43.639 --> 23:45.336
Okay, great.
Now how about your knee?

23:45.380 --> 23:46.792
I'm squeezing your right
kneecap, can you feel that?

23:46.816 --> 23:49.340
- Yeah, I can feel it.
- So, so your feet,

23:49.384 --> 23:52.431
your stomach, your legs,
your hands are all okay, right?

23:52.474 --> 23:53.649
- I'm okay.
- Yeah.

23:53.693 --> 23:55.303
You're doing really,
really well.

23:55.346 --> 23:56.802
I mean, you're answering
my questions.

23:56.826 --> 23:58.393
I think that that means that

23:58.437 --> 24:02.310
maybe you can answer some of
Dr. Abrams' questions, too.

24:02.353 --> 24:05.487
- What comes after three?
- After three...

24:05.531 --> 24:07.968
After three...
You know this one.

24:08.011 --> 24:09.578
- Four.
- You're so much stronger

24:09.622 --> 24:11.928
than you think you are,
you know that?

24:11.972 --> 24:14.409
What did FDR say?

24:14.453 --> 24:16.846
Come on, we talk
about this all the time.

24:16.890 --> 24:20.415
- Roosevelt.
- You have nothing to fear...

24:20.459 --> 24:23.723
- But fear itself.
- That's right.

24:27.683 --> 24:30.077
Raise your right index finger.

24:35.430 --> 24:37.737
That's a lot of narrowing
in the right branch.

24:37.780 --> 24:40.783
And the left as well.

24:40.827 --> 24:42.742
We need a new plan.

24:42.785 --> 24:45.135
There's no way to anastomose
to the trunk of the artery.

24:45.179 --> 24:47.224
We need to attach
further up the right side.

24:47.268 --> 24:48.637
But if we don't attach
to both sides,

24:48.661 --> 24:50.029
she'll only oxygenate
half her blood.

24:50.053 --> 24:51.620
It's a lot better than none.

24:51.664 --> 24:53.927
She'll never sat above 75
for the rest of her life.

24:53.970 --> 24:55.470
She'll be in heart failure
by the age of 30!

24:55.494 --> 24:57.147
Which can be controlled
by medications.

24:57.191 --> 24:59.323
- Connor...
- I won't let this girl die

24:59.367 --> 25:04.241
because we tried to bite off
more than we can chew.

25:04.285 --> 25:07.244
I know this is
a difficult time for you.

25:07.288 --> 25:09.116
You've suffered a loss.

25:09.159 --> 25:10.987
But I've seen you
do things in the OR

25:11.031 --> 25:13.555
that I did not think possible.

25:13.599 --> 25:16.776
This is not the time
to back away from a challenge.

25:19.822 --> 25:22.782
All right.

25:22.825 --> 25:26.568
Two anastomosis sets.

25:27.787 --> 25:29.092
Let's move it.

25:29.136 --> 25:32.313
- So what are you saying?
- We think it was

25:32.356 --> 25:34.358
the roast beef sandwich
that you're allergic to.

25:34.402 --> 25:36.056
That's what kicked off
the attack.

25:36.099 --> 25:38.754
Roast beef?

25:38.798 --> 25:41.235
I've eaten roast beef
my whole life.

25:41.278 --> 25:44.281
I like roast beef.

25:44.325 --> 25:46.153
Have you been
in the woods recently?

25:46.196 --> 25:48.372
Woods? Yeah, I...

25:48.416 --> 25:51.985
A month ago I went fishing
in Kentucky.

25:52.028 --> 25:53.726
Any tick bites?

25:53.769 --> 25:56.598
Yes, he called me and said
there were ticks everywhere.

25:56.642 --> 25:58.948
A bite from the lone star
tick which is common in

25:58.992 --> 26:01.864
the Southeast like Kentucky can
cause a sensitivity to meat.

26:01.908 --> 26:03.997
You'll need to confirm
with an allergist,

26:04.040 --> 26:07.130
but in the meantime it's best
that you stay away from meat.

26:07.174 --> 26:08.610
God.

26:08.654 --> 26:12.483
Mr. Wilks, we were very lucky
with your wife today.

26:12.527 --> 26:14.442
Has this happened before?

26:14.485 --> 26:16.096
She can wander off.

26:16.139 --> 26:17.160
We have to keep an eye on her.

26:17.184 --> 26:19.316
Yes, you do.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.188
If you find you can't manage...

26:21.231 --> 26:22.493
you know, there are facilities.

26:22.537 --> 26:26.933
Joanie was in one. Nice place.

26:26.976 --> 26:28.761
But she was depressed.

26:28.804 --> 26:32.895
Missed her house,
Roxanne and me.

26:32.939 --> 26:34.288
She's a lot happier now.

26:36.377 --> 26:39.249
We missed her, too.

26:39.293 --> 26:41.121
I know that look.

26:41.164 --> 26:43.079
You don't approve
of how we live.

26:44.646 --> 26:46.561
I doubt you have
any idea what it's like

26:46.605 --> 26:49.608
to little by little lose
someone you care deeply about.

26:49.651 --> 26:53.133
If it hadn't been for
Roxanne's love and support...

26:53.176 --> 26:54.830
I could never
take care of Joanie.

26:54.874 --> 26:59.008
It's not a perfect situation,
but it's the best we can do.

27:02.838 --> 27:05.101
Excuse us.

27:08.539 --> 27:10.411
You're gonna be okay.

27:10.454 --> 27:14.067
Unusual arrangement
but seems to work.

27:14.110 --> 27:15.546
I guess.

27:15.590 --> 27:17.679
People can live
any way they want.

27:17.723 --> 27:19.681
I'm glad to hear you say that.

27:19.725 --> 27:21.291
- Emily called.
- Yeah?

27:21.335 --> 27:22.684
She and Bernie have a plan.

27:22.728 --> 27:24.227
They'd like to discuss it
with us over dinner.

27:24.251 --> 27:26.688
What is this plan?

27:26.732 --> 27:29.778
I'm going to let Emily tell you.

27:36.742 --> 27:39.570
I informed Ms. Rush
that her surgery went well

27:39.614 --> 27:40.983
and that I anticipate
that she'll only need

27:41.007 --> 27:43.096
to spend another three days
in the hospital.

27:43.139 --> 27:46.577
Dr. Halstead.
Mr. Rush asked me to tell you

27:46.621 --> 27:49.319
that they've decided
they will try to have a baby.

27:49.363 --> 27:52.322
A sheyne por.

27:52.366 --> 27:55.543
A lovely couple.

27:55.586 --> 27:57.676
Thank you for
asking me to consult.

27:57.719 --> 28:01.244
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

28:01.288 --> 28:03.899
A baby?

28:03.943 --> 28:06.902
They didn't think
they could handle one.

28:06.946 --> 28:08.271
Looks like they
changed their mind.

28:08.295 --> 28:09.557
I guess when you've already

28:09.600 --> 28:12.299
been through so much together...

28:12.342 --> 28:14.910
Nothing much scares you.

28:14.954 --> 28:17.217
Yeah.

28:27.270 --> 28:29.969
Snip.

28:33.015 --> 28:36.018
Time on pump?

28:36.062 --> 28:38.238
Three hours 14.

28:38.281 --> 28:43.243
Should we take her off bypass?

28:55.211 --> 28:56.778
That should do it.

28:56.822 --> 28:58.911
Pressure's good.
Normal rate and rhythm.

28:58.954 --> 29:02.349
Sats are at 88.
She's going to make it.

29:02.392 --> 29:04.525
Close, if you don't mind.

29:04.568 --> 29:05.874
Not at all.

29:15.710 --> 29:17.233
Hey.

29:17.277 --> 29:20.541
What is it?

29:20.584 --> 29:23.500
I've decided
I'm not going to relocate.

29:23.544 --> 29:27.374
- Why?
- I'm tired of being afraid.

29:27.417 --> 29:30.246
I don't want to run away.

29:30.290 --> 29:32.683
I'd like to think that
you were staying because of me,

29:32.727 --> 29:34.337
but that's not the reason,
is it?

29:37.950 --> 29:39.516
Natalie?

29:46.349 --> 29:49.352
My loss.

29:52.094 --> 29:54.444
Be safe, okay?

30:12.201 --> 30:14.421
I was able to completely
resect the tumor

30:14.464 --> 30:15.988
and as I expected it's benign.

30:16.031 --> 30:18.947
Dr. Charles, I couldn't
have done it without you.

30:18.991 --> 30:20.340
Thank you.

30:20.383 --> 30:24.300
I'm the one you should
be thanking, but so be it.

30:25.649 --> 30:27.826
You should be proud of yourself.

30:32.308 --> 30:34.833
The inspirational speech
you gave that nutcase?

30:34.876 --> 30:36.269
The FDR quote?

30:36.312 --> 30:39.838
That was a dreadful cliché,
but effective.

30:40.969 --> 30:42.841
Yeah.

30:44.364 --> 30:47.671
All right, Daniel, I'll bite.
What's the problem?

30:48.629 --> 30:54.504
Well... um... fear.

30:54.548 --> 30:56.245
I think I'm having
a really hard time

30:56.289 --> 31:00.380
facing the fact that I'm going
to lose somebody that I love.

31:00.423 --> 31:03.252
- And?
- And what?

31:03.296 --> 31:06.690
Who doesn't have
a hard time with that?

31:08.170 --> 31:09.911
Shrinks.

31:09.955 --> 31:12.131
Have to make a meal
out of everything.

31:24.752 --> 31:26.667
Hey, honey. It's Dad.

31:26.710 --> 31:31.280
Um, I think I'm going to need
your help with something.

31:32.020 --> 31:33.804
Emily, there's more blankets

31:33.848 --> 31:36.720
for the guest room in
the hall closet and pillows.

31:36.764 --> 31:38.157
A- Thanks.

31:40.202 --> 31:42.944
Ethan. Do you want more chicken?

31:42.988 --> 31:44.685
No, thanks.

31:44.728 --> 31:47.470
Jamie, did you put out fresh
towels for Emily and your dad?

31:47.514 --> 31:49.646
Mom...

31:49.690 --> 31:51.692
Sorry, the bed's only a queen.

31:51.735 --> 31:54.216
The king wouldn't fit.

31:54.260 --> 31:56.871
It's okay.
I'm used to the couch.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.742
You and Emily
should sleep together so

31:58.786 --> 32:02.050
she can keep an eye on you.

32:03.530 --> 32:05.967
Did you remember
to take your stool softener?

32:06.011 --> 32:09.275
No, I didn't.

32:09.318 --> 32:11.407
- I'll clear.
- Jamie can do that.

32:11.451 --> 32:15.542
Honey, I'll take the baby.
No, sit. I'm fine.

32:15.585 --> 32:18.937
Okay. I'll help him.

32:21.809 --> 32:25.160
So... you're not judging, right?

32:25.204 --> 32:26.466
No, no.

32:26.509 --> 32:28.511
Hey, didn't I tell Emily
how happy I was for her?

32:28.555 --> 32:30.992
Living together with Bernie's
wife and daughter?

32:31.036 --> 32:33.168
I just couldn't tell
how sincere you were.

32:36.215 --> 32:38.217
Okay.

32:38.260 --> 32:41.220
This might actually
be the best solution.

32:41.263 --> 32:44.745
Emily's always had trouble
with stability.

32:44.788 --> 32:49.532
Bernie's family seems...
pretty stable.

32:49.576 --> 32:53.232
Look, what can I say?
Everybody's happy.

32:53.275 --> 32:58.280
So... why shouldn't I be?

32:59.368 --> 33:04.199
- I have something to tell you.
- What?

33:04.243 --> 33:06.636
I'm late.

33:06.680 --> 33:09.770
- Late?
- My period.

33:22.348 --> 33:25.916
Maggie.

33:25.960 --> 33:28.528
They got the path results
back on Sydney.

33:28.571 --> 33:32.097
The tumor is malignant. My God.

33:32.140 --> 33:33.794
There is another issue.

33:33.837 --> 33:37.450
Pathology says it's not
primary kidney cancer.

33:37.493 --> 33:38.625
What do you mean?

33:38.668 --> 33:42.020
The tumor is actually
breast cancer.

33:42.063 --> 33:44.892
Metastatic breast cancer.

33:44.935 --> 33:46.807
Sydney has breast cancer?

33:46.850 --> 33:49.810
And it spread?

33:49.853 --> 33:51.986
Actually...

33:52.030 --> 33:54.336
shshe doesn't.

33:56.164 --> 34:02.214
You're saying that I have
metastatic breast cancer?

34:04.085 --> 34:07.088
When was the last time
you had a mammogram, Maggie?

34:07.132 --> 34:10.309
Um, I don't know. I...

34:10.351 --> 34:11.310
A while.

34:11.353 --> 34:12.876
You're going
to have a mammogram.

34:12.920 --> 34:15.053
Today. Now.

34:15.096 --> 34:18.230
- Come on.
- No.

34:19.579 --> 34:21.885
One second.

34:45.387 --> 34:47.085
Maggie...

34:48.608 --> 34:53.091
You don't have to worry, Sydney.

34:53.134 --> 34:55.527
You're going to be okay.

34:58.357 --> 35:01.273
Thank you.

35:23.295 --> 35:28.387
Sharon, I can handle this.
Come on.

35:40.442 --> 35:45.317
We did it.
We saved that little girl.

35:46.709 --> 35:48.798
Yeah.

35:48.842 --> 35:51.192
We're a great team.

35:55.762 --> 35:59.026
Connor.

36:00.810 --> 36:03.987
I'm so sorry about your father.

36:05.032 --> 36:06.338
But...

36:06.381 --> 36:08.818
now there's nothing
keeping us apart.

36:11.038 --> 36:13.083
- What?
- He's gone, you're free.

36:13.127 --> 36:14.626
- No, Ava...
- No, no, no, listen to me.

36:14.650 --> 36:15.912
We can be together now.

36:15.956 --> 36:17.281
I think that you and I
are way past that.

36:17.305 --> 36:18.543
We're not.
We'll start over. We'll just...

36:18.567 --> 36:19.960
Ava, stop!

36:20.003 --> 36:23.268
Okay? We're finished.

36:23.311 --> 36:26.749
That's it.

36:31.276 --> 36:33.147
You ungrateful prick.

36:37.804 --> 36:41.590
Rot in hell.

36:52.645 --> 36:55.604
My goodness.

36:55.648 --> 36:59.086
This is so beautiful. Thank you!

36:59.129 --> 37:02.176
My goodness gracious.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.439
Not quite Hawaii
but it's close, right?

37:04.483 --> 37:05.484
Yeah.

37:05.527 --> 37:08.487
My goodness, look who's here!

37:10.837 --> 37:12.839
What are you guys doing here?

37:12.882 --> 37:14.580
- Hi, Mom.
- My God!

37:14.623 --> 37:18.497
- Congratulations, CeCe.
- Congratulations for what?

37:18.540 --> 37:19.846
Mrs. C!

37:19.889 --> 37:24.720
I am so happy to finally
be at your wedding.

37:24.764 --> 37:27.288
Wedding? Now?

37:27.332 --> 37:28.768
If you'd still have me.

37:31.031 --> 37:33.033
Come on, then.

37:33.076 --> 37:36.471
I'm like, my God.

37:36.515 --> 37:38.517
My God.

37:38.560 --> 37:42.347
- Carolyn, this is Keoni.
- Hi, Keoni.

37:42.390 --> 37:45.045
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

37:45.088 --> 37:47.569
In the Hawaiian language...

37:47.613 --> 37:51.704
the Hawaiian for love is aloha.

37:51.747 --> 37:54.097
You will share these leis.

37:54.141 --> 37:58.014
Exchange them in
the spirit of your aloha.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.161
Sophie should be able
to leave the hospital

38:14.204 --> 38:15.815
in about a week or ten days.

38:15.858 --> 38:17.904
And after that
she'll begin to thrive.

38:17.947 --> 38:24.650
Hit her milestones...
Crawling, walking, growing.

38:24.693 --> 38:26.391
Natalie...

38:26.434 --> 38:29.959
You've helped me so much
through a very difficult time.

38:30.003 --> 38:32.048
I'm glad I could.

38:32.092 --> 38:35.225
There's something
I wanted to ask you.

38:42.929 --> 38:45.235
Dr. Manning, can I?

38:45.279 --> 38:48.500
- Will you give me a second?
- Yeah.

38:49.544 --> 38:52.939
- What is it?
- Tim Burke's out of prison.

38:52.982 --> 38:56.290
And I advised Will
to relocate, but he won't...

38:56.334 --> 38:58.292
Because of you.

38:58.336 --> 39:01.513
He loves you.

39:01.556 --> 39:04.864
He is brave... and devoted...

39:04.907 --> 39:08.128
and you will never
find another guy like him.

39:10.304 --> 39:12.785
You would be a fool
not to take him back.

39:48.690 --> 39:50.257
Natalie. What are you...

39:50.300 --> 39:53.478
Agent Lee told me
what was going on.

39:53.521 --> 39:55.654
Will. I am so sorry.

39:58.091 --> 39:59.091
Whoa.

40:20.113 --> 40:22.376
Natalie!

40:28.687 --> 40:30.340
I got you.

40:33.343 --> 40:34.997
Natalie.

40:35.041 --> 40:37.783
No!

40:37.826 --> 40:39.045
Natalie...

40:39.088 --> 40:41.308
Natalie, come on. Wake up.

40:42.305 --> 40:48.217
