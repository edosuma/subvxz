00:00.860 --> 00:02.669
- Previously on Being Human...

00:02.700 --> 00:05.670
Stevie? I'm surprised
you're haunting school.

00:05.700 --> 00:07.589
- 'Cause I killed myself to get out?
- Yes.

00:07.640 --> 00:08.698
- Ever try sleeping?

00:08.740 --> 00:09.935
- Can we even do that?

00:09.970 --> 00:11.165
- I actually dream.

00:11.210 --> 00:13.269
- What do you want?

00:13.310 --> 00:18.180
- We've gathered here to confirm
the best vampire to lead Boston.

00:18.210 --> 00:20.349
That person is my daughter.

00:20.380 --> 00:23.486
Aidan, you will be
my daughter's second.

00:23.520 --> 00:24.510
My little girl.

00:24.550 --> 00:26.279
We must help him, Hegeman.

00:26.320 --> 00:28.311
No distractions,
no wolf.

00:28.360 --> 00:31.352
- Things took a wild turn,
didn't they?

00:31.390 --> 00:34.360
- Aaah! Get out!
- Oh my god!

00:34.400 --> 00:36.562
- And just a scratch
was enough.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.364
- I love you.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.630
(Screaming)

00:40.670 --> 00:44.937
Nora!
(Gunshot, groaning)

00:46.780 --> 00:48.930
(Josh screaming)

00:53.020 --> 00:55.409
(Growling, gunshot)

00:55.450 --> 00:56.940
(Hegeman screaming)

01:00.460 --> 01:02.224
Nora?

01:02.260 --> 01:04.922
(Groaning)

01:04.959 --> 01:06.621
(Screaming)

01:09.330 --> 01:11.219
(Screaming, panting)

01:11.270 --> 01:13.261
- Oh! Oh!

01:15.270 --> 01:19.639
All T wanted was
to sleep again, dream.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.603
Aidan!

01:21.640 --> 01:24.701
I did die in
my pyjamas after all.

01:24.750 --> 01:26.969
Aidan!
I was ready.

01:27.020 --> 01:29.739
<i>*Xk</i>

01:29.790 --> 01:33.181
I miss that rest, the escape...

01:33.220 --> 01:34.585

01:34.620 --> 01:37.988
...that luscious 8-hour break.

Sleep is no escape...

You don't get to wake up,

and realize:
"God! That was just a dream."

02:45.590 --> 02:49.595

feed with me?

03:17.490 --> 03:19.652

04:38.070 --> 04:39.674
(Birds chirping)

04:47.580 --> 04:49.582
- I looked
everywhere for you.

04:49.620 --> 04:51.440
I thought you were--

04:56.120 --> 04:58.225
You OK?

04:58.260 --> 05:00.991
- I'm a little shaky.

05:10.040 --> 05:14.136
- I did this to you
that night?

05:20.020 --> 05:24.514
Let's go inside, OK?
- Yeah, OK.

05:43.270 --> 05:46.638
- Oh, I'll make
you some tea.

05:46.680 --> 05:50.071
- OK, so, interesting social development.
- Sally.

05:50.110 --> 05:51.475
Just not now, please.

05:51.510 --> 05:53.171
- Because I met
some people and--

05:53.220 --> 05:56.042
- I had no idea
you were so beautiful.

05:57.050 --> 05:59.087
- You can see me?

05:59.120 --> 06:05.082
Oh my god, Nora! I've been
wanting to talk to you for so long! You--

06:05.130 --> 06:07.098
How can you see me?

06:08.660 --> 06:10.799
You're not
dead, are you?

06:10.830 --> 06:13.140
- I'm a wolf.

06:16.840 --> 06:20.731
- (Boy 1): Whoa!
- (Boy 2): One, two, three...

06:20.780 --> 06:22.077
- You moved! I told you not to.

06:22.110 --> 06:23.339
- Watch him.
Make sure he doesn't--

06:23.380 --> 06:25.474
- Go, go!
- I don't care.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.217
Not in the nads, OK?

06:27.250 --> 06:28.513
Anywhere but
the nads.

06:28.550 --> 06:30.985
- You flinch,
I get to do it twice.

06:36.260 --> 06:37.625
- Who are you?

06:37.660 --> 06:38.786
- You a vampire?

06:38.830 --> 06:41.049
- Uh, Josh, Nora,
this is Stevie,

06:41.100 --> 06:42.693
my friend from
the reunion. Yeah!

06:42.730 --> 06:46.189
And, uh, OK,
this is Dylan,

06:46.230 --> 06:48.631
And, uh, the guys
call him Boner.

06:48.670 --> 06:52.231
I call him Phil, the name
he was actually born with.

06:52.270 --> 06:53.340
- Boner.

06:53.380 --> 06:54.677
- What's up?

06:56.610 --> 06:58.203
- Hey, I like
your place.

06:58.250 --> 07:00.719
- I'm gonna
go wash.

07:00.750 --> 07:03.242
- I think that's, uh...

07:03.290 --> 07:06.453
I'm--I'm so sorry
about this.

07:06.490 --> 07:08.618
- Were there this many
ghosts here before

07:08.660 --> 07:10.128
and I just
couldn't see them?

07:10.160 --> 07:12.219
- No. No.
God, no.

07:12.260 --> 07:13.819
(Stevie chuckling)

07:13.860 --> 07:16.727
(Ghosts talking, indistinct)

07:16.770 --> 07:18.260
What's with
the lost boys?

07:18.300 --> 07:20.735
- Last night, had this
evil nightmare.

07:20.770 --> 07:23.307
- Wait, stop. What are you
talking about, nightmare?

07:23.340 --> 07:25.229
- I slept. Stevie
taught me how to sleep.

07:25.270 --> 07:26.999
I did it. It was
a friggin' mistake,

07:27.040 --> 07:29.099
because I dreamt
my door came back.

07:29.140 --> 07:34.044
I opened it and then
this--this thing rushed out.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.788
And I think it
actually flew out.

07:36.820 --> 07:40.711
- OK. But why are
those ghosts here?

07:40.760 --> 07:41.784
- Well, you guys
weren't here,

07:41.820 --> 07:43.322
so I went to talk
to Stevie about it,

07:43.360 --> 07:46.227
and he was at this sketchy
diner with his friends,

07:46.260 --> 07:48.399
and I don't know,
I invited them here.

07:48.430 --> 07:50.865
- Just invited them over.
Great idea.

07:50.900 --> 07:52.265
(Door slamming)

07:55.070 --> 07:56.333
- You look worse than Josh.

07:56.370 --> 07:58.065
(Ghosts laughing)

07:58.110 --> 08:00.033
And he just found
he turned Nora.

08:03.110 --> 08:04.407
- Why would
you do that?

08:04.450 --> 08:08.011
- I need a drink.
- I'm sorry. I get nervous around bad news.

08:08.050 --> 08:10.189
I have to eject it
as quickly as possible.

08:10.220 --> 08:13.190
Like food poisoning, you throw
it up, feel better. I'm sorry.

08:13.220 --> 08:16.383
- Why are there ghosts punching
each other in the balls?

08:16.420 --> 08:19.799
- Oh, God! I can't go through
this again. You do it.

08:19.830 --> 08:22.219
- (Dylan): Why not?
Come on, man! Come on!

08:22.260 --> 08:25.719
- God, Aidan.
I wanna kill myself.

08:25.770 --> 08:26.965
(Gulping)

08:27.000 --> 08:28.798
How could I have
let this happen?

08:28.840 --> 08:30.968
- OK, listen to me. You can't
do this to yourself right now.

08:31.010 --> 08:33.308
Do not make this
about you. Out!

08:33.340 --> 08:36.139
- You know, and the
sick, crazy thing

08:36.179 --> 08:38.102
is that I owe
her my life.

08:38.150 --> 08:41.120
If Nora wasn't a wolf,
I'd be dead.

08:41.150 --> 08:42.379
(Panting)

08:42.419 --> 08:45.390
There was a vampire
in the woods.

08:45.420 --> 08:47.252
He tried to kill me.

08:47.290 --> 08:49.110
One of the
Dutch guys, I--

08:49.160 --> 08:50.286
- Hegeman?

08:50.330 --> 08:52.287
- I don't know!
He had the beard.

08:52.330 --> 08:54.059
It was the boss.

08:54.100 --> 08:56.091
- Oh! Hegeman.

08:56.130 --> 08:58.064
- Nora's wolf
killed him.

08:58.100 --> 08:59.397
- (Nora): Josh?

09:00.640 --> 09:03.166
- Very important. Were there
any other vampires there?

09:03.210 --> 09:05.861
- Listen to me. I don't want
Nora to know about this, OK?

09:05.910 --> 09:07.332
She can't know that
she killed somebody,

09:07.380 --> 09:10.839
even if he was
a homicidal vampire.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.042
(Boner talking, indistinct)

09:14.320 --> 09:16.175
- That's why
his name is Boner.

09:16.220 --> 09:18.382
It requires
heavy maintenance.

09:18.420 --> 09:20.787
- He's a ghost.
He can't--

09:20.820 --> 09:23.152
- It's like a phantom limb.
He can mind-whack it.

09:23.190 --> 09:24.225
(Chuckling)

09:24.260 --> 09:25.386
- That's disgusting.

09:25.430 --> 09:28.400
- You know, I think I'm just
gonna-- I'm gonna head home.

09:28.430 --> 09:30.762
- Uh... OK, yeah.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.440
I'm sorry about
the haunted circus here.

09:33.470 --> 09:34.494
I'll walk you home.

09:34.540 --> 09:36.099
- No, I--

09:36.140 --> 09:37.801
I'm just gonna
walk by myself.

09:37.840 --> 09:40.400
But I'll, um,
call you later, OK?

09:40.440 --> 09:42.078
- Yeah.

09:43.350 --> 09:46.047
- Josh, join us, please!

09:48.880 --> 09:51.042
Aidan, you can't leave.
Hey, hey, hey!

09:51.090 --> 09:53.149
You can't go. I have
a room full of teenage boys.

09:53.190 --> 09:56.285
Besides beating off and
playing Xbox, what do they do?

09:56.320 --> 09:59.426
- That about covers it.
Get rid of them.

09:59.460 --> 10:01.053
- Your friends
kill people.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.489
This is it for me. This is
who I have to hang out with.

10:05.070 --> 10:06.697
I have to
start somewhere.

10:07.900 --> 10:11.109
Come on, you were a teenage
boy once, in medieval times.

10:16.210 --> 10:19.271
- Hey, dudes, um,
when did you die?

10:19.310 --> 10:20.277
- '01.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.549
- '86.

10:21.580 --> 10:26.381
- Well, do you want to
watch Scarface in HD?

10:26.420 --> 10:28.252
- It's out?
- Oh yeah.

10:28.290 --> 10:30.429
- Never seen it.
- What's wrong with you?

10:30.460 --> 10:32.554
That is why you've
never moved on.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.092
Come on!

10:34.130 --> 10:35.859
- That'll work,
thank you.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.295
(Siren)

10:49.510 --> 10:51.103
- How is it you get stuck

10:51.150 --> 10:54.347
minding the errant
princess again?

10:58.250 --> 11:02.084
- I'm more like
your advisor.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.349
(Chuckling)

11:03.390 --> 11:05.859
- Well, that's unsettling.

11:05.890 --> 11:10.066
You were Bishop's advisor
and he's dead.

11:12.300 --> 11:17.170
- It was complicated and it has nothing
to do with us and I promised your mother

11:17.210 --> 11:19.872
that I would help you
lead Boston, so...

11:21.580 --> 11:27.041
OK, so if you're ready,
the first thing we need to do

11:27.080 --> 11:28.878
is we need to find
someone in the police

11:28.920 --> 11:30.319
to take over
what Bishop did,

11:30.350 --> 11:32.887
covering up killings,
handling cleanups.

11:32.920 --> 11:38.154
- What's it feel like
with your maker gone?

11:38.190 --> 11:41.160
- Uh, it's a
little strange.

11:42.430 --> 11:45.127
But not necessarily
in a bad way.

11:45.170 --> 11:47.537
- I bet you feel free.

11:47.570 --> 11:51.905
So why take this job,
grooming me?

11:51.940 --> 11:54.034
Such a bizarre term,
isn't it?

11:54.080 --> 11:55.639
- Well, you know
better than anyone.

11:55.680 --> 11:58.149
Your mother speaks,
and it happens.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.444
- Well, the drapes
are different,

12:01.480 --> 12:03.482
but everything else
looks the same.

12:03.520 --> 12:06.217
It's like we were just here.

12:07.490 --> 12:10.460
Except the lights were more
flattering back them.

12:10.490 --> 12:12.549
These bulbs are so harsh.

12:12.590 --> 12:16.595
- Suren, I really think we need
to handle this police situation.

12:16.630 --> 12:18.394
Are you up to seeing
the candidates today?

12:18.430 --> 12:20.091
- Aidan, you don't
have to worry.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.666
I'm not the gullible little fool
you had to babysit then.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.907
- OK. I've changed too.

12:24.940 --> 12:26.908
- Oh, that's right.

12:26.940 --> 12:29.307
You're a vegetarian now.

12:29.340 --> 12:31.570
- Why don't we forget
about the past?

12:31.610 --> 12:34.580
- It's kind of hard
to do, isn't it,

12:36.620 --> 12:39.248
when Mother's put
us right back here

12:39.290 --> 12:41.509
at the scene
of the crime?

12:41.560 --> 12:43.255
(Screaming)

12:43.290 --> 12:44.780
It's so like her.

12:45.530 --> 12:48.249
She wants to rub
my nose in it...

12:49.260 --> 12:51.490
my weakness.

12:52.470 --> 12:55.440
But she did give you back to me.

12:55.470 --> 12:58.132
- Look, we've all
made mistakes.

12:58.170 --> 13:04.177
We just have to show her that
you are ready to lead now.

13:04.210 --> 13:06.099
- You really
think I can?

13:10.620 --> 13:12.440
- If you want to.

13:12.490 --> 13:16.256
If you're willing to
block out distractions.

13:16.290 --> 13:20.193
- I've had 80 years to
think about what I want.

13:21.260 --> 13:23.490
I won't be
distracted this time.

13:26.430 --> 13:28.194
(Woman screaming)

13:28.240 --> 13:30.163
- Please!

13:31.510 --> 13:34.639
Aaah! Let me go!

13:34.680 --> 13:36.136
(Screaming)

13:43.920 --> 13:44.944
(Siren)

13:44.990 --> 13:47.209
(People talking)

13:47.260 --> 13:50.150
(Man on PA, indistinct)

13:53.030 --> 13:54.919
(Woman chuckling)

13:56.630 --> 13:57.859
- Hey.

13:57.900 --> 14:00.130
- Hi.

14:00.170 --> 14:04.300
- Should you maybe
have taken a sick day?

14:04.340 --> 14:07.970
- No, I think this is the best
thing for me right now, working.

14:08.010 --> 14:10.877
Makes me feel
almost normal.

14:12.150 --> 14:16.576
Can I get-- Can
I--can I get a mocha?

14:16.620 --> 14:18.019
- Get whatever
you want.

14:18.050 --> 14:20.690
- No, no, no.
No, can I get a mocha?

14:20.720 --> 14:23.621
"Cause, you know, chocolate
is toxic to dogs.

14:23.660 --> 14:25.685
So I just--

14:26.900 --> 14:29.551
- (Whispering):
You're not a dog.

14:29.600 --> 14:33.093
- No, but I am, like,
a canine, right? Of sorts.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.767
- Once a month.
One night a month.

14:34.800 --> 14:38.805
The rest of the time,
we're still us.

14:38.840 --> 14:41.605
- I keep doing
my rounds, thinking:

14:41.640 --> 14:44.041
I'm a werewolf
wrapping a burn victim.

14:44.080 --> 14:46.344
- I'm a werewolf
inserting a catheter.

14:46.380 --> 14:49.748
I'm a werewolf peeing
in the ladies room.

14:52.890 --> 14:55.814
- How much do you remember
about the change?

14:55.860 --> 14:58.522
- Being in the car,

14:58.560 --> 15:02.394
and the panic, the pain.

15:02.430 --> 15:07.994
- You don't remember anything
about being the wolf?

15:08.040 --> 15:09.735
- Should I?

15:09.770 --> 15:12.501
- No. No, that's
the one blessing.

15:12.540 --> 15:16.738
We seem not to remember
what the wolf does.

15:16.780 --> 15:20.739
Why didn't you tell
me about the scratch?

15:20.780 --> 15:23.613
- I didn't know
if I was infected.

15:24.620 --> 15:29.353
- I could've prepared
you. (Scoffing)

15:29.390 --> 15:30.983
What?

15:31.030 --> 15:32.850
- I tried to talk
to you about this,

15:32.890 --> 15:33.960
but you wouldn't.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.490
- I didn't know
what you were--

15:35.530 --> 15:36.656
I didn't know why
you were asking.

15:36.700 --> 15:40.432
- If you did, you would've
flipped out even more!

15:41.840 --> 15:43.763
- Hey, Josh!
I just wanted to say

15:43.810 --> 15:45.209
I'll see you
at the mixer tonight.

15:45.240 --> 15:47.937
- Oh, the new
med-student mixer. I forgot.

15:47.980 --> 15:51.200
Crap! Yeah, um,
Nora, this is Jesse.

15:51.250 --> 15:55.073
He's just finishing up
MIT med school.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.849
- Hey, Nora.

15:56.880 --> 15:57.881
- Hi.

15:57.920 --> 15:58.887
(Clearing throat)

15:58.920 --> 16:01.719
- Uh, yeah! Hey,
congratulations, by the way.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.159
Rematriculated!
- Thanks.

16:03.190 --> 16:04.988
- Nicely played. Ha!

16:05.030 --> 16:06.828
- I've gotta go.

16:09.930 --> 16:12.399
- Yeah, I don't think
I'm gonna make it.

16:12.430 --> 16:15.661
- No, no! Dude, all the first-
years are gonna be there,

16:15.700 --> 16:17.805
girlfriends, boyfriends,
the whole catastrophe.

16:17.840 --> 16:18.932
- Yeah, but--
- Trust me.

16:18.970 --> 16:21.109
You do not wanna be
the one guy who doesn't show

16:21.140 --> 16:25.839
who the rest of the class spends
the whole night gossiping about.

16:27.950 --> 16:28.917
- (Scarface): OK...

16:28.950 --> 16:30.281
- Do you wanna
play rough?

16:30.320 --> 16:31.810
- OK!
- OK.

16:31.850 --> 16:33.852
- Say hello to
my little friend!

16:33.890 --> 16:35.710
(Gunshot)

16:35.760 --> 16:37.888
- But it really didn't
feel like a dream.

16:37.930 --> 16:41.696
Something flew out.
I felt it rush by me.

16:41.730 --> 16:44.825
- I don't know. I never heard
of ghost dreams being real.

16:44.870 --> 16:47.965
And if they were, I'd have
gotten my door 10 times over.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.934
- Well, what am I
supposed to do?

16:49.970 --> 16:52.530
What now? I'm clearly
never gonna sleep again.

16:52.570 --> 16:54.174
So how am I
supposed to fill

16:54.210 --> 16:56.975
this giant, sucking
abyss of time?

16:57.010 --> 16:58.978
(Dylan imitating machinegun)

16:59.010 --> 17:00.910
- You whores!

17:02.280 --> 17:03.714
- This can't be it.

17:03.750 --> 17:06.048
My eternal afterlife?

17:06.089 --> 17:07.887
(Dylan imitating machinegun)

17:07.920 --> 17:09.285
- Dylan!

17:09.319 --> 17:11.049
Sally's bored. Let's
take her to the bridge.

17:11.089 --> 17:13.593
- Or we could do
something actually fun.

17:13.630 --> 17:16.724
Sally, you ready to rage?

17:18.369 --> 17:20.759
- All right.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.733
Let's rage.

17:22.770 --> 17:25.501
(Explosion and screaming on TV)

17:27.910 --> 17:29.002
- Oh!
- Whoa!

17:29.040 --> 17:30.872
- I'm sorry!
- I am so sorry!

17:30.910 --> 17:33.709
- Wow! Somebody's thirsty.

17:33.750 --> 17:37.687
- Uh, yeah, well, we can't
keep this stuff in stock.

17:37.720 --> 17:39.779
- Trauma patient?
- Uh, anaemic.

17:39.820 --> 17:41.049
- Oh.
- Do you work here?

17:41.090 --> 17:44.025
- I'm trying. I'm interviewing
for my residency.

17:44.060 --> 17:45.459
- Oh, who are you
interviewing with?

17:45.490 --> 17:48.790
- Dr. Norlick.
(Inhales sharply)

17:48.830 --> 17:51.026
I knew it.
He's an ass, isn't he?

17:51.070 --> 17:52.697
I mean, what kind of
a name is Norlick?

17:52.730 --> 17:54.562
Don't put "lick"
in your name.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.432
- He's not normally an ass.

17:56.470 --> 17:58.006
It's just that
his wife left him

17:58.040 --> 18:02.602
and he's just a little bit,
extremely angry, OK?

18:02.640 --> 18:03.744
Hold on, I--

18:03.780 --> 18:05.248
- Yeah.
(Buzzing, chuckling)

18:05.280 --> 18:06.748
- I gotta--
- Yeah.

18:06.780 --> 18:09.545
- I should-- I gotta take this.
- Yeah.

18:09.580 --> 18:11.844
- Hello?
- Aidan, it's Suren.

18:11.890 --> 18:12.982
- Yeah.

18:13.020 --> 18:14.681
- I need you to meet me
at the hotel.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.724
- Two werewolves
at a cocktail party.

18:17.760 --> 18:21.719
Sounds sexy.
- No, no, no... Not--not--not wolves.

18:21.760 --> 18:23.228
Not 2 wolves. Us.

18:23.270 --> 18:24.863
This--this is
who we are,

18:24.900 --> 18:28.495
Josh and Nora, the cute,
normal, hardworking,

18:28.540 --> 18:32.602
why-is-the-gorgeous-nurse-going-
for-the strange-orderly couple.

18:32.640 --> 18:36.508
We can't let this
thing take over us.

18:36.540 --> 18:38.975
- No, I was dreading this
mixer way before last night.

18:39.010 --> 18:40.876
- Yes! See, that's the
proper human attitude,

18:40.920 --> 18:42.945
hatred of awkward
social situations.

18:42.980 --> 18:44.812
That's me, like,
all the time.

18:46.950 --> 18:48.486
- I'm gonna go home,

18:48.520 --> 18:50.750
I'm gonna put on my khakis
and my blue blazer,

18:50.790 --> 18:54.749
and you are going to put on your
female equivalent of that,

18:54.800 --> 18:57.428
and we are going
to mingle tonight.

18:57.470 --> 18:58.460
- Mingle?
- Yes.

18:58.500 --> 18:59.592
- Right.

18:59.630 --> 19:02.861
- Listen, there are
6-year-olds on the 3rd floor

19:02.900 --> 19:07.508
battling leukemia, and if
they can still smile, so can we.

19:07.540 --> 19:11.443
- I can't believe you just
played the cancer card.

19:11.480 --> 19:14.939
- Yeah. Um...
(Sighing)

19:14.980 --> 19:17.881
And I got
you a mocha.

19:17.920 --> 19:19.479
(Chuckles)

19:22.420 --> 19:24.422
(Car honking)

19:24.460 --> 19:26.986
(Women laughing)
- (Woman): Yeah.

19:27.030 --> 19:29.556
- Ah! There he is.

19:29.600 --> 19:33.798
Cecilia,
this is Aidan.

19:33.840 --> 19:37.333
What did I tell you?
Gorgeous, right? Sit.

19:37.370 --> 19:38.360
- Suren, I'm in the middle
of a shift.

19:38.410 --> 19:41.436
- I have a story
and it won't wait.

19:41.480 --> 19:47.419
I was out walking and Boston's changed
so much. I was completely turned around,

19:47.450 --> 19:51.683
and then Cecilia showed up,
like a heavenly answer.

19:51.720 --> 19:53.017
- Oh, you're
very dramatic.

19:53.050 --> 19:55.382
- Oh, yes, she is. Yes.

19:55.420 --> 19:58.219
- I keep looking at you,
thinking: "Have I seen him?"

19:58.260 --> 20:01.992
But I don't think so. I would've remembered you.
- Where from?

20:02.030 --> 20:03.429
- The hospital.

20:03.470 --> 20:06.519
Suren told me that you're a nurse.
- So you work there?

20:06.570 --> 20:10.359
- No, I'm a cop.
- Lucky us.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.332
(Chuckling)

20:11.370 --> 20:14.601
- You're looking for
someone to do security.

20:14.640 --> 20:18.201
- Aidan's been hounding
me about it. I'll leave you to it.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.369
Just a moment.

20:25.390 --> 20:29.952
I told you I already have cops
lined up. Cops who are vampires.

20:29.990 --> 20:33.392
- We can't rely on a bunch
of paunchy Bishop leftovers

20:33.430 --> 20:35.421
who are gonna hate
taking orders from a woman

20:35.460 --> 20:36.859
and the vampire who
who killed him.

20:36.900 --> 20:39.870
We need people who
will be loyal to us.

20:39.900 --> 20:43.700
- They'll be loyal to whoever's
in power and that's you.

20:43.740 --> 20:46.004
You speak with
Mother's authority.

20:46.040 --> 20:47.474
(Sighing)

20:47.510 --> 20:51.299
Besides which, you can't just
turn some random cop

20:51.350 --> 20:52.545
that you met on a stroll.

20:52.580 --> 20:54.514
You don't know
anything about her.

20:54.550 --> 20:56.541
- Feeling a little
abandoned over here.

20:56.580 --> 20:58.412
(Both chuckling)

20:58.450 --> 21:02.512
- Aidan, she's smart.
She's ambitious

21:02.560 --> 21:05.427
And anything she likes
you can mold her into.

21:05.460 --> 21:09.829
- If you want her, you're gonna
have to turn her yourself.

21:09.860 --> 21:14.798
- You think I'm asking too much
for you to break your diet?

21:14.840 --> 21:17.810
You said you
would help me.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.205
You have no idea

21:19.240 --> 21:22.278
how I'm compromising
myself for you already.

21:22.310 --> 21:23.800
- How's that?

21:23.850 --> 21:26.000
- You say our first
order of business

21:26.050 --> 21:29.839
is to find a new connection
in the police department.

21:29.880 --> 21:35.683
But there are some who might
want us to focus on, say, Hegeman...

21:37.730 --> 21:40.893
his sudden disappearance.

21:40.930 --> 21:45.868
I could let them sniff
around if you'd like.

21:45.900 --> 21:47.959
It's up to you.

21:56.340 --> 21:58.741
** Meet me on the dark side

21:58.780 --> 22:03.217
* Enter from the inside...

22:03.250 --> 22:06.242
- I was always planning
to go to B.U.

22:06.290 --> 22:07.917
Now I can at least go
to their parties

22:07.960 --> 22:09.314
that I would never
have gotten invited to.

22:09.360 --> 22:12.227
- So this it? This is raging,
walking around,

22:12.260 --> 22:15.958
just watching a bunch of
drunk people dance like idiots?

22:16.000 --> 22:21.063
- You gotta pick your moment,
spot your guy, and jump in.

22:21.100 --> 22:24.400
- OK, well, what's the point if
you can't drink and smoke

22:24.440 --> 22:26.932
and grind up on somebody you
hope you'll never see again?

22:26.970 --> 22:27.869
- Who says
you can't?

22:27.910 --> 22:30.902
- How about we just
swing off a ceiling fan?

22:30.950 --> 22:32.247
We just got here.

22:32.280 --> 22:35.841
- (Boner): I think we just found 2 fish.
- And now we rage.

22:35.880 --> 22:36.847
- Check it.

22:36.880 --> 22:38.848
* Imprisoned by fate

22:38.890 --> 22:41.985
* Shame, blame
It's the shame game

22:42.020 --> 22:45.558
* But I will love again...

22:48.830 --> 22:50.298
(Both gasping)

22:50.330 --> 22:51.968
Whoa!

22:52.000 --> 22:53.263
(Laughing)

22:53.300 --> 22:54.734
Yeah, yeah!

22:56.670 --> 23:00.880
- Oh my god! Did they just
highjack those guys?

23:00.910 --> 23:02.275
Oh my god!

23:02.310 --> 23:03.948
- It's not that
great. Trust me.

23:03.980 --> 23:07.280
* Everyone has a dark side

23:07.310 --> 23:11.247
* Why don't you like mine?

23:11.290 --> 23:14.260
* Qverseas... *

23:14.290 --> 23:16.156
(Dog barking)

23:20.260 --> 23:21.989
- Hi.

23:22.030 --> 23:23.225
See, this is lovely.

23:23.260 --> 23:26.560
When was the last time we got
all dressed up and went out?

23:26.600 --> 23:28.489
- Yeah, everything
is picture perfect.

23:28.540 --> 23:29.996
- Josh!

23:30.040 --> 23:32.930
- I need
a martini, stat.

23:32.970 --> 23:33.937
- Hey!

23:33.980 --> 23:35.607
- We made it.
We made it, yeah.

23:35.640 --> 23:37.404
It's, uh...

23:37.450 --> 23:40.943
- OK, so is there,
like, a magic portal

23:40.980 --> 23:42.709
between the shoulder blades
that you just--

23:42.750 --> 23:44.218
- You've never taken
a body before?

23:44.250 --> 23:47.811
- I did once for, like,
10 seconds accidentally.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.817
There was this medium and
she was trying to exorcise me

23:49.860 --> 23:51.919
and it felt like I was
being ripped apart,

23:51.960 --> 23:53.997
so I just jumped into her.

23:54.030 --> 23:55.327
I was like one of
those mothers

23:55.360 --> 23:58.091
who'd flip over a car
to save her burning baby.

23:58.130 --> 23:59.859
- Holy crap!

23:59.900 --> 24:02.961
- Yeah, Kind of jacked
me up for a while.

24:03.000 --> 24:07.107
- Well, see, like, drunk
people, or high people,

24:07.140 --> 24:08.210
they're a little bit
easier to get into.

24:08.240 --> 24:10.470
You know, their resistance is lower.
- Ah!

24:10.510 --> 24:13.969
- Then you have people who are
generally easier to get into.

24:14.020 --> 24:18.014
And then you have fools who
you just cannot get into at all.

24:18.050 --> 24:20.417
- Why, because their
will is stronger?

24:20.450 --> 24:21.679
- I've actually never
figured that out.

24:21.720 --> 24:24.189
It's just harder.
You just can't.

24:24.230 --> 24:27.188
- OK, so why aren't you
wearing somebody.

24:27.230 --> 24:28.459
- It's kind of like
getting wasted.

24:28.500 --> 24:33.859
You know, I used to, but it sent
me down a very, very dark path.

24:33.900 --> 24:40.237
And anyway, it doesn't really
matter who I'm in. I'm still me inside.

24:40.270 --> 24:43.649
- You've got a hardcore emo
thing going on, you know that?

24:43.680 --> 24:47.548
- Yeah, supposedly it works well
with the goth ghosts.

24:47.580 --> 24:48.615
You know what?
Let's bounce.

24:48.650 --> 24:50.175
- No! Are you serious?

24:50.220 --> 24:51.585
Maybe I can find
someone with

24:51.620 --> 24:53.042
a cute pixie haircut.

24:53.090 --> 24:55.184
- It's not like _
trying on new outfits!

24:55.220 --> 24:56.984
This is like a crack den!

24:57.020 --> 24:59.227
You really wanna be
on the pipe right now?

24:59.260 --> 25:01.558
- You know what? I'm gonna be
completely honest with you.

25:01.600 --> 25:04.524
I've always been a smidge
curious about the crack.

25:04.570 --> 25:05.594
Really, is anything that good?

25:05.630 --> 25:07.189
It's, like, you know
what I always said?

25:07.230 --> 25:10.029
If I know I'm gonna die,
I'm 95 years old,

25:10.070 --> 25:11.936
I'm living in a hospice,

25:11.970 --> 25:13.040
I'm gonna try heroin,

25:13.070 --> 25:15.903
just to see
what it feels like.

25:15.940 --> 25:17.578
Once.

25:19.080 --> 25:20.150
- Please don't
do this.

25:20.180 --> 25:24.947
(* Woman singing
on sound system, indistinct )

25:27.720 --> 25:30.553
- (Man): Oh! Give her
another beaker!

25:30.590 --> 25:32.854
- It's not that easy.

25:38.970 --> 25:42.691
- Whoa! Whoa!

25:42.740 --> 25:43.707
Aaah!

25:43.740 --> 25:46.266
Whoa! Whoa!

25:58.990 --> 26:00.879
(Gasping)

26:00.920 --> 26:03.082
- Yes! Yes!

26:03.120 --> 26:06.329
Oh! Yes! Aaah!
- Hey!

26:06.360 --> 26:09.898
- Oh, I felt that!
(Gasping)

26:09.930 --> 26:11.261
Oh my god!

26:11.300 --> 26:13.962
(Laughing)

26:14.000 --> 26:16.867
(* Man singing in Spanish
on sound system )

26:16.900 --> 26:18.902
Mmm!

26:23.650 --> 26:25.243
- You really like beer.

26:25.280 --> 26:27.248
- That doesn't mean
I'm slutty.

26:27.280 --> 26:29.942
I like the feeling of it
sliding down your throat.

26:29.980 --> 26:31.482
Like, the bubbles
that go--

26:31.520 --> 26:33.318
You know it burns
and it tickles at

26:33.350 --> 26:35.079
the same time!

26:35.120 --> 26:36.918
- You're totally
baked right now.

26:36.960 --> 26:41.693
- Mm-mmm.
Super alert, super clear.

26:41.730 --> 26:43.926
Senses firing
like fireworks.

26:43.970 --> 26:45.597
It's like... ah!

26:50.640 --> 26:52.665
I love 7-layer dip.

26:54.910 --> 26:56.969
(Giggling)

27:06.750 --> 27:10.687
(* Man singing in Spanish )

27:17.230 --> 27:18.664
- You want a drink?

27:20.370 --> 27:24.432
- We should probably
just stick to business.

27:26.910 --> 27:29.277
- Is that your code word?

27:32.950 --> 27:36.147
- I really wish
you hadn't come.

27:38.990 --> 27:41.709
You don't know
what this is.

27:41.760 --> 27:43.683
- What?

27:43.730 --> 27:45.949
Is Suren gonna
walk in on us?

27:45.990 --> 27:47.697
What's it with
you two, anyway?

27:47.730 --> 27:49.255
Come on.

27:49.300 --> 27:52.793
I'm a cop.
I've heard it all.

27:54.970 --> 27:56.995
(Moaning)

28:10.220 --> 28:14.111
Are we gonna do this with our ccl;othes on?
- Go.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.720
- What?
- GET OUT!

28:19.460 --> 28:22.327
- You're a freakin' nutcase.

28:28.300 --> 28:30.962
(Whimpering)

28:35.380 --> 28:38.099
- So, you guys have been
dating for a couple months.

28:38.150 --> 28:39.208
- Yeah.

28:39.250 --> 28:40.172
- No.

28:40.210 --> 28:46.115
- Yes, we have.
- But really on and off.

28:46.150 --> 28:50.257
- We've all been there. Not
that that's bad. (Chuckling)

28:50.290 --> 28:52.429
- We're very close, though.

28:52.460 --> 28:57.000
You know how tragedy, like,
brings people together.

28:57.030 --> 28:58.896
We've been
through a lot.

28:58.930 --> 29:01.638
We've been hit
by so much lately.

29:01.670 --> 29:03.536
- Uh, Nora, are you OK?

29:03.570 --> 29:05.208
- You need to go
to the bathroom.

29:05.240 --> 29:06.935
- I'm fine. I just...
- You sure?

29:06.970 --> 29:08.233
- ...want a bit
more wine.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.702
(Sighing)

29:09.740 --> 29:12.004
- I think you've
had enough.

29:12.050 --> 29:13.745
- No, actually,
I haven't.

29:13.780 --> 29:16.044
- I know you don't
think so, but you have.

29:16.080 --> 29:19.141
- And I know you
think so, but I haven't.

29:19.190 --> 29:20.646
- Nora, please, stop...

29:20.690 --> 29:22.886
- We're just gonna go
get some food.

29:22.920 --> 29:26.720
- I woke up naked in a pile
of leaf litter this morning

29:26.760 --> 29:27.921
with a squirrel
in my mouth,

29:27.960 --> 29:30.600
so I'm gonna need
a little bit more.

29:30.630 --> 29:33.019
- What happened?

29:33.070 --> 29:36.700
- We were camping. We went
camping last night. She's kidding.

29:36.740 --> 29:39.209
- It's not like I'm
pregnant anymore, right?

29:40.980 --> 29:43.904
So I can drink
whatever I want.

29:43.950 --> 29:45.873
- I'm so sorry.

29:45.910 --> 29:48.811
- That's fine.
A miscarriage.

29:49.950 --> 29:51.748
It's all gone.

29:54.260 --> 29:56.012
I'm sorry.

29:56.060 --> 29:58.449
I'm so sorry.

29:59.190 --> 30:00.897
I'm so sorry.

30:12.210 --> 30:13.974
- Wow.

30:14.010 --> 30:15.899
- Hey.

30:22.020 --> 30:23.772
I'll get us a cab.

30:23.820 --> 30:24.844
- I'm so sorry...

30:24.890 --> 30:25.914
- No.

30:25.950 --> 30:28.783
- ...but I'm too drunk
to pretend that I'm normal.

30:28.820 --> 30:31.687
- No, I'm sorry.

30:31.730 --> 30:33.653
I shouldn't have
made you do this.

30:33.690 --> 30:35.055
Not today.
It was stupid.

30:35.100 --> 30:40.095
- Today, 2 weeks from now.
It doesn't matter.

30:41.970 --> 30:43.768
I can't fix this
by pretending.

30:43.800 --> 30:46.667
- I just wanna
make it better.

30:46.710 --> 30:49.133
- It's like when people
come into the hospital,

30:49.180 --> 30:52.707
their kid's in a coma,
and they ask me:

30:52.750 --> 30:54.616
"What can we do?"

30:56.050 --> 31:00.044
And I tell them
to just stay with them,

31:00.090 --> 31:01.751
be with them.

31:01.790 --> 31:03.758
But what that
really means

31:03.790 --> 31:06.452
is that there's
nothing they can do.

31:08.060 --> 31:11.064
You know that
better than anyone.

31:17.070 --> 31:18.868
(Elevator bell dinging)

31:20.710 --> 31:24.408
- You don't feed, you don't
kill and you can't turn.

31:24.450 --> 31:26.908
How is this supposed
to work exactly?

31:26.950 --> 31:28.247
- I almost killed her,
all right?

31:28.280 --> 31:29.543
It's been too
long since I fed.

31:29.580 --> 31:31.719
I don't have that
kind of control now.

31:31.750 --> 31:34.720
- You're supposed to be
my second, my right hand.

31:34.760 --> 31:36.956
You did this
for Bishop.

31:36.990 --> 31:38.958
- I'm not that
vampire anymore,

31:38.990 --> 31:41.891
- I used to
worship you.

31:43.630 --> 31:48.033
I wanted to be as strong, as
calculating, as ruthless as you.

31:48.070 --> 31:53.099
And when I opened my eyes and
saw you standing there at my side.

31:53.140 --> 31:56.838
I thought:
"With his help,

31:56.880 --> 32:00.009
"I can be everything
I was supposed to be,

32:00.050 --> 32:02.974
"my mother's daughter.”

32:05.090 --> 32:09.209
How did you think we'd bring
a city of vampires to heal

32:09.260 --> 32:11.729
without shedding
a drop of blood?

32:11.760 --> 32:15.151
- I don't think that there's
anything that I can say

32:15.200 --> 32:20.661
about all the things, the people
that brought me to this point

32:20.700 --> 32:23.067
that would make
you understand.

32:23.100 --> 32:26.035
- Get out.

32:31.010 --> 32:33.001
(Panting)

32:33.050 --> 32:35.075
(Laughing)

32:37.080 --> 32:38.741
- You taking off?

32:38.790 --> 32:40.110
- No!

32:40.150 --> 32:42.949
Hey, Dylan,
you smell that?

32:43.990 --> 32:45.754
It's jasmine.

32:47.090 --> 32:48.125
(Giggling)

32:48.160 --> 32:50.322
- That's intense.

32:50.360 --> 32:52.920
- I never thought
I'd smell anything again.

32:52.970 --> 32:54.790
All that zen crap,

32:54.840 --> 32:57.036
about embracing
the moment,

32:57.070 --> 32:58.959
it's true!

32:59.010 --> 33:02.275
It's like, just to feel
solid like this, you know?

33:02.310 --> 33:05.803
Now I feel
like crying.

33:07.950 --> 33:10.248
I wish I lived every
moment like this.

33:10.280 --> 33:11.748
- You can.

33:11.790 --> 33:14.009
- It's like one
big do-over now.

33:14.060 --> 33:16.188
You can try on
as many as you want.

33:17.790 --> 33:19.189
- Oh, I have goose bumps.

33:19.230 --> 33:21.050
I have goose bumps.

33:21.100 --> 33:23.057
Oh, I never want
to leave.

33:23.100 --> 33:24.090
I never wanna leave.

33:24.130 --> 33:26.064
- And that's not
even the best part.

33:26.100 --> 33:29.035
- Ha! Whoa? This isn't
even my body.

33:29.070 --> 33:30.936
- Then who cares?

33:30.970 --> 33:33.234
- You didn't
just say that.

33:34.980 --> 33:36.129
(Gasps)

33:39.680 --> 33:42.775
Get off me! Get off!

33:42.820 --> 33:44.242
Get me out!

33:44.290 --> 33:46.509
- It's way harder to
get out than to get in.

33:46.550 --> 33:50.054
- Stop! Get off me!
Get me out!

33:50.090 --> 33:51.956
- Stevie, stop it!

33:53.560 --> 33:55.995
- I told you
this was dangerous.

33:56.030 --> 33:58.260
- Who the hell do
you think you are?

33:58.300 --> 33:59.961
You wanna die again?

34:00.000 --> 34:02.867
I'm gonna rip
your punk-ass head off.

34:02.900 --> 34:03.970
- Settle down.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.731
- You think this
IS your business?

34:06.770 --> 34:07.805
- Hey, get off him!

34:07.840 --> 34:10.536
- You get into my face
and tell me to settle down?

34:10.580 --> 34:12.002
You stickless freak.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.176
- Come on. Let's go.

34:13.210 --> 34:14.813
- You always
get like this!

34:14.850 --> 34:16.909
- Shut up!
- You get all "aggro” in people!

34:16.949 --> 34:18.940
- Shut your face.
- You need to stop taking!

34:18.989 --> 34:20.879
- You don't tell
me what to do.

34:20.920 --> 34:23.480
- No! No, stop!

34:23.520 --> 34:25.079
(Groaning)

34:26.060 --> 34:28.255
No!
- Aaah!

34:28.300 --> 34:29.495
(Whimpering)

34:31.370 --> 34:33.065
- What happened to him?

34:33.100 --> 34:34.067
- Oh, crap!

34:34.100 --> 34:35.067
- What did you do?

34:35.100 --> 34:36.135
- I didn't mean to.

34:36.170 --> 34:37.989
I told you.

34:38.040 --> 34:40.235
This is what happens
when you take.

34:41.239 --> 34:43.072
You lose control.

34:43.110 --> 34:44.248
I'm sorry.

34:47.580 --> 34:50.947
- Oh God! Oh my...

34:50.980 --> 34:52.118
(Crying)

34:55.120 --> 34:56.985
- They can't void
your acceptance

34:57.020 --> 34:58.829
because your girlfriend
flipped out, right?

34:58.860 --> 35:00.487
- None of that
matters anymore.

35:00.530 --> 35:01.827
I'm not going
to med school.

35:01.860 --> 35:04.568
- What? What,
are you embarrassed

35:04.600 --> 35:06.398
that they know that
about us, 'cause screw them!

35:06.430 --> 35:09.138
- No, I'm not
embarrassed. I'm just--

35:09.170 --> 35:13.539
Pulling all-nighters so that
I can be a dermatologist

35:13.570 --> 35:15.937
seems beside
the point now.

35:15.980 --> 35:18.199
It's not what I want.

35:18.250 --> 35:22.574
I want to work on
finding a cure.

35:22.620 --> 35:23.872
- A cure,
(Scoffing)

35:23.920 --> 35:25.615
- Yes, I need
to fix this!

35:25.650 --> 35:27.243
I need to try and
fix this for you!

35:27.290 --> 35:31.181
- No, whoa. I do not want you
giving up med school for me.

35:31.230 --> 35:32.584
I don't want that
responsibility.

35:32.630 --> 35:35.258
- What do you want?
What--what do you want?

35:35.300 --> 35:40.659
I admit we can't go on
like nothing has changed.

35:42.440 --> 35:45.102
You say I can't
do anything,

35:45.140 --> 35:46.539
but maybe I can.

35:46.570 --> 35:48.470
- I don't know
what I want.

35:48.510 --> 35:49.875
(Sighing)

35:49.910 --> 35:52.504
I didn't want it
to be like this.

35:52.550 --> 35:55.474
I wanted us
to be happy,

35:55.520 --> 36:01.050
not be together
because we're monsters.

36:01.090 --> 36:02.558
<i>- I know.</i>

36:04.190 --> 36:07.125
It all moves so fast.

36:07.160 --> 36:09.527
Too fast.

36:09.560 --> 36:13.519
And I know I don't look
like it right now, but I'm--

36:13.570 --> 36:15.436
I'm happy.

36:16.470 --> 36:18.939
You--you make me happy.

36:20.570 --> 36:24.347
- Then why do I feel like
we're completely screwed?

36:24.380 --> 36:30.114
- Because that's the appropriate,
human and non-psychotic reaction.

36:48.470 --> 36:49.960
- You turned her.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.630
- She took to my blood
like a kitten to milk.

36:59.910 --> 37:01.571
(Gulping)

37:03.050 --> 37:05.883
- Did you know that
I haven't turned anyone

37:05.920 --> 37:08.048
since I last saw you?

37:12.560 --> 37:16.053
Because of what
he did to you.

37:16.100 --> 37:18.569
- What are we
gonna do, Aidan?

37:19.930 --> 37:22.137
Why did you take this job...

37:22.170 --> 37:23.990
really...

37:24.040 --> 37:27.237
when you knew you'd
be right back at my side?

37:27.270 --> 37:30.638
You knew what
you'd be asked to do.

37:30.680 --> 37:36.278
- Your mother is way too smart
to give you an unwilling second.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.880
I told her that
I would help you,

37:38.920 --> 37:41.014
I would guide you,

37:41.050 --> 37:44.259
I would make
you a success,

37:44.290 --> 37:47.157
only because then...

37:48.160 --> 37:50.424
then she'd set me free.

37:51.470 --> 37:53.996
- Set you free?

37:54.030 --> 37:58.900
- To live how I want,
with who I want,

37:58.940 --> 38:03.002
and to never have to deal
with vampires ever again.

38:04.480 --> 38:07.541
- Sounds kind of lonely.

38:07.580 --> 38:10.072
- No one knows Boston
better than me.

38:10.120 --> 38:12.680
No one can move
the pieces better than me.

38:12.720 --> 38:15.087
And if it ever
came to a fight...

38:16.090 --> 38:18.286
I killed Bishop,

38:18.330 --> 38:20.890
and that's worth
everything here.

38:20.930 --> 38:23.319
I will work for you.

38:24.330 --> 38:27.527
But I could never be like you.

38:27.570 --> 38:30.835
- Except for that
last, little bit,

38:30.870 --> 38:34.204
you're beginning to sound
like the old you.

38:40.180 --> 38:43.070
- I feel like I got
run over by a bus.

38:43.120 --> 38:46.090
And the bus is parked
on top of me.

38:46.120 --> 38:49.613
- I wish I could give you
a shot of B-12

38:49.660 --> 38:51.219
or start an 1V.

38:51.260 --> 38:53.456
- I'd kill for
just some Tylenol.

38:53.490 --> 38:57.449
- And this is what happens
when you go into people?

38:57.500 --> 39:01.061
- Well, at least
I'm still here.

39:03.570 --> 39:06.164
- You think
he's really...

39:06.210 --> 39:07.564
gone?

39:07.610 --> 39:10.102
- I felt it.

39:10.140 --> 39:13.110
It's like Dylan was there

39:13.150 --> 39:17.212
and then he just
wasn't anywhere.

39:17.250 --> 39:19.116
It's like his energy
got snuffed out.

39:19.150 --> 39:22.120
No!

39:22.160 --> 39:24.254
I just didn't know that
we could do this to each other,

39:24.290 --> 39:27.021
that we were
capable of this.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.491
(Panting)

39:31.260 --> 39:33.490
(Growling)

39:36.170 --> 39:39.299
- I think it's better to know
what you're capable of.

39:42.240 --> 39:45.608
Then you understand
what you're dealing with.

39:53.650 --> 39:55.209
(Elevator bell dinging)

39:58.590 --> 40:02.254
- Yes?
- Forgive me, but Hegeman and I

40:02.300 --> 40:04.394
- were to share
a ride home together.

40:04.430 --> 40:06.262
Any word?
- Word of what?

40:06.300 --> 40:08.632
- He was doing
business for your mother.

40:08.670 --> 40:10.195
- Well, Mother is away

40:10.240 --> 40:14.609
and Hegeman is not in the habit
of checking in with me.

40:17.540 --> 40:21.170
- I suppose I can take this up with Mother.
- Do.

40:21.210 --> 40:23.178
(Sighing)

40:23.220 --> 40:25.587
Safe travels.

40:42.700 --> 40:44.702
- (Woman on sound system):
** Take all

40:44.740 --> 40:47.232
* That you want from me

40:47.270 --> 40:49.830
* T've nothing left

40:49.880 --> 40:52.850
* Lies or regrets...

40:52.880 --> 40:54.644
- Hi.

40:54.680 --> 40:56.739
Can I get a whiskey
on the rocks, please?

40:56.780 --> 40:59.647
* T've nothing left

40:59.690 --> 41:02.159
* I'm all but dead

41:02.190 --> 41:03.851
- (Man):
* And I don't know

41:03.890 --> 41:06.757
* And I don't know

41:06.790 --> 41:08.827
* And I don't know

41:08.860 --> 41:10.726
* And I don't know... *

41:10.760 --> 41:12.819
- OK, I'm not.

41:12.870 --> 41:16.295
But what if I really
were stalking you?

41:16.340 --> 41:18.069
(Laughing)

41:19.810 --> 41:22.302
- How was your
interview?

41:22.340 --> 41:23.739
- Let's just say,

41:23.780 --> 41:28.149
don't think your hospital's
the best fit for me anyway.

41:28.180 --> 41:30.319
- Oh, no, no, no.
Norlick...

41:30.350 --> 41:32.114
- Turns out he's a douche,

41:32.150 --> 41:33.709
wife or no wife.

41:33.750 --> 41:37.209
I gotta stop saying "douche".
It's... It's anti-feminist.

41:37.260 --> 41:41.083
- Hey, you know what, though?
You're gonna land some place better.

41:41.130 --> 41:45.192
There's nothing worse than
working where you don't belong.

41:47.600 --> 41:49.739
- So someone's had
a rough day too, huh?

41:49.770 --> 41:51.169
- Yeah.

41:51.200 --> 41:54.204
Yeah, yeah. It was.
But, um...

41:56.840 --> 41:59.810
So far it's got
a really nice ending.

42:01.850 --> 42:04.547
I'm Aidan, by the way.

42:04.590 --> 42:06.012
- I'm Julia,
by the way.

42:06.050 --> 42:06.983
(Chuckling)

42:07.020 --> 42:08.385
- Nice to meet
you, Julia.

42:08.420 --> 42:10.218
- Nice to meet
you too, officially.

42:10.260 --> 42:14.128
** My head's awake

42:14.930 --> 42:18.628
* Too be sure

42:20.730 --> 42:22.698
You wanna get
out of here?

42:22.740 --> 42:26.802
* That I can't escape

42:28.880 --> 42:30.837
Last call.

42:30.880 --> 42:32.871
* Find

42:35.780 --> 42:37.714
(Heart pounding)

42:37.750 --> 42:42.483
* With hell to pay

42:42.520 --> 42:47.060
* I'll be here

42:49.800 --> 42:54.169
* And I'm on your side *

43:01.980 --> 43:04.176
<i>*Xk</i>
