00:47.728 --> 00:50.856
Remember Argyle Somerfield,
the old movie star?

00:51.031 --> 00:54.558
83, according to this.
He's just had a baby with his nurse.

00:55.402 --> 00:59.736
"It was love at first sight," she cooed.
"I've always liked older men."

00:59.906 --> 01:03.398
If she ever met Tutankhamen,
he wouldn't stand a chance.

01:04.444 --> 01:08.881
She'd have his bandages off
before he could say "Silicone implants"!

01:09.049 --> 01:12.246
There's a picture of 'em with their newborn.

01:12.419 --> 01:15.752
There's Argyle, and there's the baby.

01:18.125 --> 01:22.027
No, THERE'S Argyle and THERE'S the baby.

01:24.531 --> 01:27.022
I was thrown by the bib and the bonnet.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.361
I thought it was the baby at first.

01:37.811 --> 01:40.939
An 83-year-old dad?!

01:41.948 --> 01:43.939
How's that gonna work?

01:44.718 --> 01:48.176
I bet he won't get up in the night
to give the baby its feed.

01:48.355 --> 01:50.585
He'll probably pretend to be dead.

01:53.794 --> 01:56.262
"Darling, can you feed the baby tonight?"

02:01.902 --> 02:03.893
It's not gonna work, is it?

02:04.070 --> 02:06.504
The only advantage, as far as I can see,

02:06.673 --> 02:11.076
is the wife can change both their nappies
at the same time!

02:17.717 --> 02:22.552
Are you still not talking to me?
It's unbelievably childish, you know.

02:24.724 --> 02:28.626
I've a good mind to fill your shoes
with runny porridge again.

02:28.795 --> 02:31.457
That'd teach you a lesson about maturity.

02:35.101 --> 02:39.731
All right. I bet I can make you say something
in the next minute.

02:41.675 --> 02:43.040
20 big ones.

02:43.810 --> 02:45.141
Shake on it.

02:48.315 --> 02:51.148
All right. If I'm on, say nothing.

02:52.886 --> 02:54.251
I'm on!

02:54.421 --> 02:55.820
OK.

02:55.989 --> 03:01.950
I'm going to say something and you're going
to totally lose it. Are you ready? Ready?

03:03.330 --> 03:10.259
All right. Several years ago, when money was
not abundant, and I medically needed a pint...

03:12.072 --> 03:14.131
I took some money from your purse.

03:14.307 --> 03:16.639
(GROANING)

03:16.810 --> 03:18.607
(IMITATES EXPLOSION)

03:18.778 --> 03:21.110
God, it was horrible going in there.

03:21.281 --> 03:23.977
The wallet that time forgot!

03:24.150 --> 03:27.551
Not that there was any point.
They wouldn't serve me.

03:27.721 --> 03:30.713
Said doubloons weren't legal tender any more.

03:30.891 --> 03:34.327
You should have handed them in
after the Spanish Armada!

03:38.265 --> 03:42.224
I thought I'd get you going.
You hate digs about your stinginess.

03:42.402 --> 03:48.272
It usually makes you so agitated that you make
a cup of tea with a brand-new tea bag!

03:53.046 --> 03:56.675
Well, still... Plenty of time to go.

03:57.717 --> 03:59.685
(LAUGHS)

04:02.188 --> 04:04.622
Remember Yvonne McGruder?

04:05.859 --> 04:08.555
You really liked her, didn't you?

04:08.728 --> 04:13.722
I used to go out with her - before you did.
You didn't know that, did you?

04:13.900 --> 04:18.269
Broke up in the end. Really hurt me.
Still got the scars today.

04:19.238 --> 04:22.504
They never heal, carpet burns, do they?

04:25.145 --> 04:28.410
Both cheeks, man!

04:28.582 --> 04:31.551
She nearly wore them down to the bone!

04:32.886 --> 04:36.117
(SCREECHES)

04:36.289 --> 04:37.722
Will you shut up?!

04:37.891 --> 04:39.859
What did I tell ya?

04:40.026 --> 04:41.823
20 big ones.

04:41.995 --> 04:45.897
I've listened to you wittling on
for what seems like two ice ages.

04:46.066 --> 04:47.897
My mind is so numb and drained,

04:48.068 --> 04:52.698
I feel like I've attended a three-day seminar
on the future of plumbing.

04:53.540 --> 04:55.735
Do you know how irritating you are?

04:55.909 --> 05:00.608
You're a master. There are things
you could teach to tropical skin diseases.

05:00.780 --> 05:03.146
- Talk to me, then.
- No!

05:03.316 --> 05:06.308
I'm sorry! How many times
do you want me to say it?

05:06.486 --> 05:08.750
- I am sorry!
- No, you're not.

05:08.922 --> 05:12.414
- It was an accident.
- You poured a whole tube of it over me,

05:12.592 --> 05:17.029
you disgusting, rotting, fetid
piece of congealed monkey vomit!

05:17.430 --> 05:21.423
At last you're talking to me.
I knew we'd make it up.

05:24.104 --> 05:25.799
83!

05:41.287 --> 05:43.915
(CAT) It seems even bigger than I remember.

05:45.725 --> 05:49.661
Er... guys, we got a problem!

05:52.699 --> 05:55.634
- Guys, look at me body.
- There's an invitation

05:55.835 --> 05:57.735
that will not cause a stampede!

05:57.904 --> 06:00.702
- It's back to normal.
- No time for that now.

06:00.874 --> 06:07.370
We're flying down a corridor on Red Dwarf,
and Starbug appears to be expanding!

06:07.547 --> 06:10.209
It's Red Dwarf that's shrinking.

06:10.383 --> 06:14.080
It's to do with the nanobot molecular process,
like my body.

06:16.122 --> 06:19.148
We're being sucked into a vent. I can't fight it.

06:23.063 --> 06:27.591
- (KRIS) Air-vent walls closing in.
- We must be bold, positive, decisive.

06:27.767 --> 06:31.498
- Suggest we move from blue alert to red alert.
- Forget red.

06:31.671 --> 06:34.731
Let's go all the way up to brown alert!

06:36.509 --> 06:38.773
There's no such thing as brown alert.

06:38.945 --> 06:41.277
You won't be saying that in a minute!

06:42.382 --> 06:44.680
And don't say I didn't alert you.

06:45.418 --> 06:49.821
<i>All right, dudes. Anyone fancy</i>
<i>a game of charades using just your nose,</i>

06:49.989 --> 06:53.891
- <i>or is this a bad time?</i>
- We're about to get crushed to death!

06:54.060 --> 06:56.051
<i>So that's a no, then?</i>

06:56.229 --> 06:58.129
Once the nanos rebuilt the ship,

06:58.298 --> 07:03.133
- I thought things would get back to normal.
- We haven't a clue what's happening.

07:03.303 --> 07:05.134
Things ARE back to normal.

07:05.305 --> 07:07.500
<i>You don't even fancy a quick one?</i>

07:09.242 --> 07:14.373
<i>Science-fiction film,</i>
<i>name of the ship, one word.</i>

07:14.547 --> 07:18.313
<i>(HUMS THROUGH HIS NOSE)</i>

07:21.321 --> 07:23.312
<i>The Nostrilomo.</i>

07:24.791 --> 07:27.157
<i>Spent a week thinking that one up.</i>

07:27.327 --> 07:28.624
<i>Good, innit?</i>

07:28.795 --> 07:33.061
- Computing time to impact. Calculations here.
- How long have we got?

07:33.233 --> 07:36.669
- About the time it takes to read a Stop sign.
- That's OK.

07:36.836 --> 07:39.737
I don't always get through those in one sitting.

07:40.507 --> 07:43.135
- What are our chances?
- About the same odds

07:43.309 --> 07:48.212
as discovering Mr. Lister saddle-stitching
the hem of linen maternity slacks.

07:48.381 --> 07:52.715
It's been a while since I did that.
Can't you get this crate to go faster?

07:52.886 --> 07:58.256
- We'll get crushed by a gigantic trouser press!
- Freshly laundered and wrinkle-free.

07:59.359 --> 08:03.796
- I always prayed I'd go out like that.
- There may be a way through this.

08:03.963 --> 08:06.591
Go past Epsilon 14, right at the hydro unit.

08:06.766 --> 08:08.666
- Saves two minutes.
- Well, sir?

08:08.835 --> 08:14.364
I don't understand a woman who's hurtling
towards 30 and still has a teddy called Boo-Boo.

08:14.541 --> 08:18.500
- But as a navigator, there's none finer!
- What's your view, Hol?

08:18.678 --> 08:22.136
<i>Straight up your nose</i>
<i>when you lean in like that.</i>

08:22.315 --> 08:23.942
Epsilon 14.

08:26.820 --> 08:29.653
There's some kind of heartbeat up ahead.

08:29.823 --> 08:34.760
- It's beating at an incredible rate.
- There's a heart out there with no body?

08:34.928 --> 08:36.861
No wonder it's beating so fast!

08:49.676 --> 08:52.645
(THROBBING HEARTBEAT)

09:03.556 --> 09:05.956
<i>Hope we don't get stopped by the cops.</i>

09:06.125 --> 09:08.992
<i>They don't like it when you're rat-arsed.</i>

09:27.180 --> 09:29.171
We've lost all engines.

09:30.683 --> 09:35.211
Didn't I read somewhere
that can seriously affect your ability to fly?

09:39.592 --> 09:42.561
Now we've lost the midsection and the kitchen.

09:42.729 --> 09:46.790
I'm sorry, everyone, but we may have
to have sandwiches for lunch.

09:47.767 --> 09:49.098
(ALL) Oh...

10:08.922 --> 10:10.890
(COUGHING)

10:36.115 --> 10:38.709
- Dave?
- Selby...

10:38.885 --> 10:41.217
Chen... Is it really you?

10:42.088 --> 10:44.352
Is it really us? Hang on. I'll check.

10:45.558 --> 10:48.857
- Think it's us.
- Guys, this is brilliant.

10:49.028 --> 10:52.623
- I can't believe it!
- You know these people, sir?

10:52.799 --> 10:56.030
Know them? When they've been drunk
and unconscious,

10:56.202 --> 10:59.433
I've undressed them
and painted parts of them green.

10:59.605 --> 11:01.766
This is the Red Dwarf crew, Krytie!

11:01.941 --> 11:05.206
- How?
- The nanos resurrected them with the ship.

11:05.378 --> 11:09.280
This is Chen. He works in the kitchen.
He's always drunk.

11:09.449 --> 11:13.408
And this is Selby, and he's always drunk, too.
Where's Petersen?

11:13.586 --> 11:14.917
He couldn't make it.

11:15.088 --> 11:17.147
He's drunk!

11:17.323 --> 11:22.090
The crew are all alive. Great news.
Wonderful, marvellous, incredible news.

11:22.261 --> 11:25.094
All that extra ironing - bliss!

11:28.434 --> 11:31.460
Mr. Thornton, read them their rights.

11:32.505 --> 11:37.272
David Lister, you are formally charged
with stealing and crashing a Starbug,

11:37.443 --> 11:43.211
having no pilot's licence, and smuggling
two stowaways onboard with Officer Kochanski.

11:43.383 --> 11:48.320
Anything you say or do not say now may be
used by the board of inquiry against you.

11:48.488 --> 11:50.718
Do you require any form of aid?

11:50.890 --> 11:54.348
Yeah, lemonade and a really large Scotch.

11:54.527 --> 11:56.620
Left, right, left, right...

11:56.796 --> 12:00.926
- Relax. You'll burst a blood vessel.
- Shut up! Do you understand?!

12:01.100 --> 12:03.000
- Do you understand?!
- Yes.

12:03.169 --> 12:04.466
Yes, what?

12:04.637 --> 12:08.835
- Yes, Mr. Shouty.
- Yes, sir! Left, right, left, right...

12:09.842 --> 12:11.901
...left, right. Halt!

12:12.078 --> 12:14.069
Left arm.

12:16.716 --> 12:18.274
At ease.

12:23.823 --> 12:25.757
<i>(HOLLY) All right, dude?</i>

12:25.925 --> 12:31.420
They don't know about you yet. It might be
an idea to keep it that way. I need some info.

12:31.597 --> 12:34.464
If the board finds us guilty, what happens then?

12:34.634 --> 12:39.367
<i>They'll probably have a pot of tea,</i>
<i>a bit of a chat and go home, I suppose.</i>

12:39.539 --> 12:42.099
What happens to us, you divvy, not them!

12:42.275 --> 12:45.335
<i>If you lose, you'll get two years in the brig.</i>

12:45.511 --> 12:47.502
- What brig?
- <i>The brig on floor 13.</i>

12:47.680 --> 12:50.706
- There isn't a floor 13.
- <i>It was classified.</i>

12:50.883 --> 12:52.646
<i>A need-to-know-only basis.</i>

12:52.819 --> 12:54.844
- So who knew?
- <i>All the officers,</i>

12:55.021 --> 12:58.616
<i>and anyone who's ever seen</i>
<i>"The Twilight Zone".</i>

12:58.791 --> 13:00.782
What's it like, this brig?

13:00.960 --> 13:05.693
<i>If I was an estate agent, I'd describe it</i>
<i>as an old-style penal establishment,</i>

13:05.865 --> 13:08.265
<i>abundant wildlife, 200 bedrooms</i>

13:08.434 --> 13:10.959
<i>all with en suite buckets.</i>

13:11.804 --> 13:13.465
Smegging 'ell!

13:13.639 --> 13:15.630
<i>They call it the Tank.</i>

13:15.808 --> 13:20.404
<i>There was an inmate population of 400</i>
<i>all being transported to Adelphi 12.</i>

13:20.580 --> 13:26.314
- <i>Presumably they've all been resurrected, too.</i>
- What are they like? No, don't tell me.

13:26.486 --> 13:32.721
They're all deranged, hairy no-lobes, breath like
old nappies, arms like toilet walls, aren't they?

13:33.559 --> 13:36.653
<i>Well, the nice ones are, yeah.</i>

13:36.829 --> 13:41.163
<i>Hang on. I've got one of them on file</i>
<i>somewhere. Here we go.</i>

13:43.236 --> 13:44.533
<i>I'm Nigel.</i>

13:44.704 --> 13:46.228
<i>I'm nice.</i>

13:48.307 --> 13:51.765
<i>See what I mean? They're not all headbangers.</i>

13:52.345 --> 13:55.872
<i>Nige is lovely.</i>
<i>Though he does tend to get a bit narky</i>

13:56.048 --> 13:59.108
<i>if you go too close to him with a magnet.</i>

14:00.753 --> 14:03.551
Thanks, Hol. You're really cheering me up (!)

14:05.358 --> 14:07.417
The brig!

14:07.593 --> 14:09.424
Two years!

14:09.595 --> 14:11.825
Two years without curry and lager!

14:11.998 --> 14:14.626
Two years without sex!

14:15.468 --> 14:17.868
You hope.

14:18.037 --> 14:21.529
- Rimmer!
- They're gonna throw the book at you, Listy,

14:21.707 --> 14:24.767
then the bookcase and library, brick by brick.

14:24.944 --> 14:27.139
God, it's you like you used to be.

14:27.313 --> 14:29.042
(GROANS)

14:29.649 --> 14:34.677
What got into you? You can't fly a Starbug.
You're a technician. A zero. A nobody.

14:35.688 --> 14:37.246
This is gonna sound nuts,

14:37.423 --> 14:43.293
but the whole crew died, including you, and you
were resurrected by these microscopic robots.

14:43.462 --> 14:48.490
I died? All the crew died? And you're gonna
spend the next two years in the brig

14:48.668 --> 14:51.933
with a load of Neanderthals
with badly spelt tattoos?

14:52.838 --> 14:55.102
So where are we? Is this my heaven?

14:56.309 --> 15:01.303
Look, a radiation leak wiped everybody out.
I survived 'cause I was in stasis.

15:01.480 --> 15:06.417
Then these nanos arrived, rebuilt the ship
and resurrected the crew.

15:06.586 --> 15:09.521
- So where are they?
- Dunno. Gone. Scarpered.

15:09.689 --> 15:14.217
- Maybe I should take the Fifth.
- I'd take the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth, too.

15:14.393 --> 15:20.093
I've got to find these nanos to corroborate our
story, otherwise who will believe our defence?

15:20.266 --> 15:24.532
Meths drinkers and the Corn Circle Society.
I need your help, man.

15:24.704 --> 15:29.471
- Me?
- Who else will help? I'm confined to quarters.

15:29.642 --> 15:34.875
The minute I go through that door, I get enough
watches up me jacksie to light up Bootle.

15:35.047 --> 15:38.608
Considering what the future
has in store for your jacksie,

15:38.784 --> 15:41.753
a couple of zillion volts will be easy street.

15:43.122 --> 15:46.182
Why have the nanobots put us in this situation?

15:46.359 --> 15:50.659
In the past, they've only ever done things
which have benefited us.

15:50.830 --> 15:53.856
- Like what?
- Like when they first stole Red Dwarf.

15:54.033 --> 15:56.024
We went halfway round the galaxy.

15:56.202 --> 15:59.968
They led us to Legion,
where Mr. Rimmer acquired a hard-light body.

16:00.139 --> 16:03.700
- Benefit.
- Then, back at Red Dwarf, they rebooted Holly.

16:03.876 --> 16:09.109
Benefit. And after that, they led you
to the temporal rip where you met me.

16:16.522 --> 16:18.752
(TOILET FLUSHES)

16:22.128 --> 16:24.392
(HISSING SPRAY)

16:28.200 --> 16:33.604
Is it true we're three million light years into
deep space, and Red Dwarf's changed shape?

16:34.674 --> 16:39.611
That is classified information, Karen!
Who the hell told you that?

16:39.779 --> 16:41.770
The coffee machine on G Deck.

16:41.947 --> 16:46.407
Damn coffee machine! I'm gonna bust
his ass down to tampon dispenser.

16:47.687 --> 16:48.984
Is it true?

16:49.955 --> 16:52.753
Until we get Holly back up, we can't verify it.

16:52.925 --> 16:57.487
Starbug took out a CPU bank in the crash.
We're having trouble rebooting.

16:57.663 --> 17:03.533
The coffee machine said the ship's identical to
its original design plans - before the cutbacks.

17:03.703 --> 17:07.298
We now have a quark level
matter-anti-matter generator,

17:07.473 --> 17:11.910
ship wired by organic computer networking,
and a karaoke bar on C deck.

17:12.078 --> 17:15.479
But how? And how did we wind up in deep space?

17:15.647 --> 17:18.116
Nobody knows.

17:28.794 --> 17:32.423
We don't believe this one's human.
Take a look at this.

17:32.598 --> 17:34.896
(WHISTLES) Has he got the measles?

17:35.067 --> 17:36.625
Those are his nipples.

17:38.904 --> 17:42.169
Six nipples?
What's the female of the species like?

17:42.341 --> 17:44.434
Pretty easy to please in bed.

17:45.845 --> 17:48.245
Especially if you play the piano.

17:49.048 --> 17:51.915
- His internal organs are different, too.
- How?

17:52.084 --> 17:55.611
His kidney, liver, appendix,
are colour-coordinated.

17:57.690 --> 18:01.490
And even weirder, his stomach wall
appears to be decorated.

18:01.660 --> 18:05.061
This guy's intestines look better
than my quarters.

18:05.231 --> 18:11.397
His heartbeat's weird, too. Instead
of a normal heartbeat, his sounds... cooler.

18:12.271 --> 18:16.901
Do you think I'm gonna have the dorky human
heartbeat? Doo-duh. Doo-duh.

18:17.076 --> 18:20.671
Doo-duh. Doo-duh. Where's the tune in that?

18:20.846 --> 18:23.110
Let me hear it.

18:24.483 --> 18:27.748
(HIP-HOP BEAT)

18:30.523 --> 18:32.957
Also, his pulse is a different rhythm.

18:34.360 --> 18:37.352
(SAMBA RHYTHM)

18:41.300 --> 18:44.895
That's good. Will you slam that
down on tape for me?

18:50.609 --> 18:54.670
Rimmer, help me escape.
I've got to track down these nanobots.

18:54.847 --> 18:58.305
I'm not risking my career for you.
I'm going places.

18:58.484 --> 19:00.543
Up the ziggurat lickety-split (!)

19:00.719 --> 19:04.246
Precisely. I'm going to pass the engineering exam.

19:04.423 --> 19:07.586
- And become an officer.
- Yes. An officer.

19:07.760 --> 19:10.160
A guy of honour, decency and breeding.

19:11.130 --> 19:14.099
Are you saying I haven't got those qualities?

19:14.266 --> 19:19.329
People with breeding, when they're bored
and want my bridge club chums to go home,

19:19.505 --> 19:24.909
they do not play "Popeye the Sailor Man"
with a kazoo inserted between their buttocks.

19:26.679 --> 19:28.169
I remember that.

19:28.347 --> 19:31.578
(LAUGHS) I used to do that sort of thing,
didn't I?

19:31.750 --> 19:37.120
And when someone's had a tad too much claret
and has fallen asleep naked on their bunk,

19:37.289 --> 19:41.817
people of honour generally don't take
a Polaroid of your snoozing todger,

19:41.994 --> 19:44.588
draw a moustache, mouth and ears on it...

19:45.464 --> 19:49.560
...then pin it up on the bulletin board
under "Missing Persons".

19:56.909 --> 20:02.745
They don't write underneath, "Have you seen
this man, believed to be a French movie star?"

20:04.316 --> 20:08.719
As if your todger with eyes drawn on it
would look like a French movie star.

20:09.555 --> 20:11.716
Way too good-looking.

20:12.358 --> 20:15.555
- Don't expect help from me.
- But that was years ago.

20:15.728 --> 20:18.094
- It was last week!
- Last week for you.

20:18.264 --> 20:21.700
You've just been resurrected - years ago for me.

20:21.867 --> 20:25.826
Anyway, I was wurlitzered then.
I even finished off the advocaat.

20:26.005 --> 20:30.499
I even downed that smeg-awful pink stuff
at the back of the drinks cabinet.

20:30.676 --> 20:33.042
That was my Windolene.

20:34.446 --> 20:36.607
I'd used it to clean the glass.

20:36.782 --> 20:41.242
It tasted all right
with that chartreuse green liqueury thing in it.

20:41.420 --> 20:43.911
You drank my Swarfega, too?

20:45.424 --> 20:50.361
- You're unbelievable.
- I'm different now. More mature and debonair.

20:50.529 --> 20:55.023
I don't even stir me tea with a spanner
any more. You'd hardly recognise me.

20:55.200 --> 20:57.828
- Have you stopped playing the guitar?
- No.

20:58.003 --> 21:01.530
But I've stopped accompanying myself
on me armpit.

21:01.707 --> 21:05.268
I don't have to take
my frustrations out on you any more.

21:05.444 --> 21:06.809
How's that?

21:06.979 --> 21:12.315
I've been away. What is it? Five or six years
not counting stasis? I've done stuff.

21:12.484 --> 21:16.420
Stuff that would make your hair straight.
I've come through it.

21:17.923 --> 21:20.255
- I can help you.
- Do what?

21:20.426 --> 21:22.417
Get promoted.

21:23.429 --> 21:24.726
Preposterous!

21:24.897 --> 21:26.228
How?

21:27.199 --> 21:32.933
Information. I saw the crew's confidential
reports. I know their strengths and weaknesses.

21:33.872 --> 21:36.136
- How?
- Before you were resurrected,

21:36.308 --> 21:38.674
I had the run of the whole of the ship.

21:38.844 --> 21:43.406
I've seen the crew's files, medical records,
therapy sessions - the works.

21:43.582 --> 21:46.210
Knowledge is power. Who said that?

21:46.385 --> 21:48.376
- I don't know.
- Nor do I.

21:50.289 --> 21:53.884
The point I'm making is
I can make you look like a genius.

21:54.059 --> 21:59.463
You can get promoted. You won't have
to take exams - do that astroengineering smeg.

21:59.632 --> 22:01.691
Just help me escape.

22:01.867 --> 22:07.737
I have my principles. You think you can buy me
with promises of power and glory? You think...

22:07.906 --> 22:09.897
OK, I'll do it.

22:11.310 --> 22:14.370
- You'll have to prove it to me first.
- You're on.

22:14.546 --> 22:16.571
- Get me promoted.
- You've got it.

22:16.749 --> 22:18.444
OK. Deal.

22:18.617 --> 22:21.848
The confidential files are in Starbug's cockpit.

22:22.021 --> 22:24.990
The senile version of Holly
is loaded into this watch.

22:28.260 --> 22:32.321
Hello. I'm Dr Lucas McClaren.
I'm the ship's chief psychiatric counsellor.

22:32.498 --> 22:36.594
I thought it was time we got together
and had a really good natter.

22:36.769 --> 22:38.532
My name is Kryten, sir.

22:38.704 --> 22:42.333
Lovely. We are doing well, aren't we!

22:43.275 --> 22:46.369
Now, you're a robot, aren't you?

22:46.979 --> 22:49.777
I was the last time I looked, sir, yes.

22:49.948 --> 22:53.941
Can you tell me when you were created?
Can you remember?

22:54.119 --> 22:55.609
2640, sir.

22:55.788 --> 22:58.348
Very good. 2640.

22:58.524 --> 23:01.550
Now, that's in the future, isn't it?

23:01.727 --> 23:03.991
Yes, sir. I was created after you died.

23:04.163 --> 23:06.154
Lovely!

23:07.099 --> 23:13.163
So, I died and you were created - how long
would you say I've been dead altogether?

23:13.338 --> 23:16.307
- You're not dead any more, sir.
- Aren't I?

23:17.309 --> 23:21.268
- No. You're alive again now, sir. Can't you tell?
- Right...

23:21.447 --> 23:25.747
I was alive, died, and then started living again.

23:25.918 --> 23:29.319
- You've been most fortunate, sir.
- I have, haven't I?!

23:29.488 --> 23:33.549
Golly. Your chair IS screwed down,
isn't it, Kryten?

23:36.628 --> 23:39.791
- Yes, sir.
- Just checking. Excellent. Lovely.

23:39.965 --> 23:41.660
So...

23:41.834 --> 23:44.598
How did I suddenly spring back to life again?

23:44.770 --> 23:48.570
You were rebuilt
by these teeny-weeny tinty little robots.

23:48.741 --> 23:51.938
- Tinty little robots?
- They make this little noise.

23:52.111 --> 23:53.908
(SQUEAKS) Mini-mini-mini.

23:54.079 --> 23:57.606
Yes. Just double-check that chair for me,
would you?

23:57.783 --> 24:00.513
- It IS screwed down, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

24:00.686 --> 24:04.452
With long, long screws
that go deep, deep into the ground?

24:04.623 --> 24:06.488
Yes, sir.

24:06.658 --> 24:12.221
Tell me. What kind of robot do you think
you are? What were you programmed to do?

24:12.397 --> 24:17.528
I'm a sanitation droid. I do sanitation-type
things - washing, cleaning, ironing.

24:17.703 --> 24:21.935
You also drive spaceships, don't you?
Pretend to be the science officer

24:22.107 --> 24:26.601
and sit in that swivelly chair
with those pretty buttons and press them all.

24:26.779 --> 24:28.303
Yes, I do that too, sir.

24:28.480 --> 24:31.540
- That's sort of thanks to Mr. Lister.
- Mr. Lister?

24:31.717 --> 24:36.950
He helped me break my programming.
I've developed some serious character faults

24:37.122 --> 24:39.147
of which I'm extremely proud.

24:39.324 --> 24:41.952
I'm even able to lie to a modest standard.

24:42.127 --> 24:44.857
For example, you have a very fine haircut.

24:45.030 --> 24:47.089
(LAUGHS)

24:49.034 --> 24:53.130
See how good I've got?
Also, I've completely mastered pomposity,

24:53.305 --> 24:55.739
even though I say so myself.

24:55.908 --> 25:00.208
I've also developed several
rudimentary emotions, including fear...

25:00.379 --> 25:03.143
(SHRIEKS) Oh, my God. It's going to kill us!

25:03.315 --> 25:06.546
Sadness... (QUIETLY) Oh, my God. It's killed us.

25:07.352 --> 25:08.649
Happiness...

25:08.821 --> 25:10.413
Oh, no, it hasn't!

25:10.589 --> 25:13.956
Surprise...
(SQUEALS) Ooh! I've turned into a frog!

25:15.260 --> 25:21.688
And just lately, I've got the hang of anger
with rudimentary mindless violence. Arrgh!

25:24.036 --> 25:25.560
That's a newie.

25:25.737 --> 25:29.104
I was gonna launch it
at this year's emotion show.

25:29.274 --> 25:32.004
At the moment, I'm working on ambivalence,

25:32.177 --> 25:36.341
which means feeling two opposite emotions
about the same thing.

25:36.515 --> 25:38.915
(GROANS)

25:40.953 --> 25:43.285
I haven't got the hang of that one yet.

25:44.423 --> 25:47.449
I look like a dog with a caramel toffee.

25:51.129 --> 25:56.294
- What is your relationship with Lister?
- I love Mr. Lister. He taught me everything.

25:56.468 --> 25:59.130
Without him, I'd probably be normal.

26:00.839 --> 26:04.673
I'm gonna make a recommendation
which I think will help you,

26:04.843 --> 26:09.075
but just before I do,
double-check that chair for me, would you?

26:20.125 --> 26:21.649
(TAPPING KEYS)

26:23.195 --> 26:24.719
Yes!

26:29.234 --> 26:32.499
Luck virus? Sexual magnetism?

26:33.038 --> 26:34.938
- (BEEP)
- Holly, what's this?

26:35.107 --> 26:39.009
<i>They got them years ago</i>
<i>from this scientist called Lanstrom.</i>

26:39.177 --> 26:44.376
<i>They're positive viruses. One gives you</i>
<i>sexual magnetism, the other gives you luck,</i>

26:44.549 --> 26:47.416
<i>till your natural defences combat the virus.</i>

26:47.586 --> 26:50.419
Sexual magnetism!

26:50.589 --> 26:54.491
- <i>Are you gonna use it?</i>
- Is Paris a kind of plaster? You bet I am!

26:54.660 --> 26:57.288
A tiny swigette to see if it works.

26:57.462 --> 26:59.453
Well, bottoms up.

27:01.366 --> 27:04.767
Then bottoms down,
and hopefully, bottoms up again!

27:13.912 --> 27:15.903
(ALL) Hi there!

27:17.849 --> 27:19.339
Ladies?

27:19.518 --> 27:21.509
Hi, Arnold.

27:21.687 --> 27:24.281
The world loves a bastard!

27:31.229 --> 27:34.460
<i>(SONG) It's cold outside,</i>
<i>there's no kind of atmosphere</i>

27:34.633 --> 27:37.932
<i>I'm all alone, more or less</i>

27:38.103 --> 27:41.300
<i>Let me fly far away from here</i>

27:41.473 --> 27:44.101
<i>Fun, fun, fun</i>

27:44.276 --> 27:47.939
<i>In the sun, sun, sun</i>

27:48.113 --> 27:51.378
<i>I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose</i>

27:51.550 --> 27:54.576
<i>Drinking fresh mango juice</i>

27:54.753 --> 27:58.086
<i>Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes</i>

27:58.256 --> 28:00.952
<i>Fun, fun, fun</i>

28:01.126 --> 28:04.584
<i>In the sun, sun, sun</i>

28:04.763 --> 28:07.596
<i>Fun, fun, fun</i>

28:07.766 --> 28:12.260
<i>In the sun, sun, sun</i>

28:13.305 --> 28:19.919
