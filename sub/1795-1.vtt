WEBVTT

01:45.751 --> 01:47.120
You know the economy is going to crash.

01:47.221 --> 01:49.821
That's why I'm here.
The problem is the bail-out plan.

01:49.822 --> 01:51.323
It's only going to make the
problem worse

01:51.324 --> 01:52.624
and exacerbate things.

01:52.625 --> 01:54.593
The politicians have
to resist the urge...

01:54.594 --> 01:56.261
Coast Guard and environment
cleanup organizations

01:56.262 --> 01:57.629
are working overtime

01:57.630 --> 02:01.149
to clean up the disastrous
53,000-gallon spill

02:01.150 --> 02:02.784
that left over 30 miles
of pristine coastline

02:02.785 --> 02:04.352
soaked with sludge and oil.

02:04.353 --> 02:07.255
It's still unclear how long it
will take to clean up this mess

02:07.256 --> 02:09.657
and what long-term effects it
will have on the environment...

02:09.657 --> 02:11.159
We need to do
something fast.

02:11.160 --> 02:13.094
Adjustable rate mortgages
have already done enough damage

02:13.095 --> 02:14.362
and we have not seen
anything yet.

02:29.461 --> 02:32.264
...just like President Richard
Nixon did to the Vietnamese

02:32.265 --> 02:33.414
back in the late '60s...

02:33.415 --> 02:35.583
Osama bin Laden,
al Qaeda,

02:35.584 --> 02:37.519
these people are out
to kill us. People don't--

02:37.520 --> 02:39.287
All of these things
contribute to

02:39.288 --> 02:42.224
the problem of overpopulation...

02:42.225 --> 02:43.508
People don't comprehend
the danger

02:43.509 --> 02:46.161
that this country
creates for the world...

02:46.162 --> 02:48.963
If just 15 millilitres is
released and becomes airborne,

02:48.964 --> 02:50.431
this chemical could kill
a million people...

02:50.432 --> 02:52.951
Oil is not only one
of the reasons,

02:52.952 --> 02:55.419
but the main reason
to go to war in Iraq,

02:55.420 --> 02:57.655
despite what federal
governments are saying.

02:57.656 --> 02:59.490
Thousands of Australian
troops have been sent--

02:59.491 --> 03:01.525
As mentioned in that story,

03:01.526 --> 03:03.628
the soaring prices of oil is
a world-wide problem...

03:03.629 --> 03:06.548
Efforts to reduce emissions
and pollution are required

03:06.549 --> 03:09.851
immediately to reduce the
effects of global warming.

03:09.852 --> 03:11.202
If we do not react soon...

03:14.840 --> 03:16.975
Monetary policy allows
American citizens

03:16.976 --> 03:18.542
to borrow trillions of dollars

03:18.543 --> 03:19.743
without the ability to
pay any of the money back...

03:19.744 --> 03:21.245
What were the beachgoers
thinking

03:21.246 --> 03:23.348
when they left 10 tons of
garbage behind on the beach

03:23.349 --> 03:25.416
this Labour Day weekend?
The bottom line is...

03:25.417 --> 03:27.318
The shooting happened in a
supermarket parking lot

03:27.319 --> 03:29.420
in broad daylight with
dozens of people around.

03:29.421 --> 03:31.555
Yeah, I couldn't believe it.
I was shocked.

03:31.556 --> 03:33.358
I was just standing there,
and he came up shooting.

03:33.359 --> 03:35.810
I saw him fall...

03:35.811 --> 03:38.580
He's killed a lot of people here.

03:53.312 --> 03:56.314
Bill, are you up?
Come and have breakfast.

03:56.315 --> 03:59.884
Beautiful woman's ring,
straight out of Africa.

03:59.885 --> 04:04.255
Retails at $699.99...

04:08.560 --> 04:09.727
Hey, darling.

04:09.728 --> 04:11.295
Hey, honey.
How are you doing?

04:11.296 --> 04:12.280
Did you sleep okay?

04:12.281 --> 04:14.849
I did. You were
a tiger last night.

04:16.385 --> 04:17.851
Did you put milk out already?

04:17.853 --> 04:19.853
Yeah.
Okay.

04:19.855 --> 04:21.255
I want to see if there's a
mirror I can--

04:21.257 --> 04:23.024
Hey, honey. How are you doing?

04:23.025 --> 04:24.025
Good.

04:24.026 --> 04:25.160
You've already got everything.

04:25.161 --> 04:26.894
Sweetheart, you're
taking care of business.

04:26.895 --> 04:28.129
That's fantastic.

04:28.130 --> 04:29.364
I've got your coffee.
Let's move things along.

04:29.365 --> 04:30.932
Sweetie, I just want to mention

04:30.933 --> 04:33.401
that these should have
been put away, okay?

04:33.402 --> 04:36.104
Okay. I mean,
you've got to chip in.

04:36.105 --> 04:38.106
I thought I did that.

04:45.348 --> 04:47.748
Okay, but
find a way that's not--

04:47.749 --> 04:49.750
because you know what--

04:52.188 --> 04:53.688
I don't want to do this
on a rush,

04:53.689 --> 04:55.123
because it's an important thing.

04:55.124 --> 04:57.625
But your mother and I were
talking last night.

04:57.626 --> 05:01.529
We didn't get a lot of sleep--
not for the reason you think.

05:01.530 --> 05:03.865
That's gross.

05:03.866 --> 05:07.235
We think it's time you
moved on and moved out.

05:09.671 --> 05:10.671
Fuck!

05:10.672 --> 05:11.672
Don't worry about it.

05:11.673 --> 05:12.673
Okay.

05:12.674 --> 05:13.674
I'll get a napkin.

05:13.675 --> 05:15.710
I'm sorry.

05:15.711 --> 05:18.713
Help your father.

05:18.714 --> 05:19.814
You got it, Dad?

05:19.815 --> 05:22.183
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:22.184 --> 05:23.584
Sorry, Mom.

05:23.585 --> 05:24.685
No, it's okay.

05:24.686 --> 05:26.921
But it's just that,
look, you're 23...

05:26.922 --> 05:28.623
You've got to get your
own place, right?

05:28.624 --> 05:29.991
I know. You keep saying that.

05:29.992 --> 05:31.259
You just spilt more on me.

05:31.260 --> 05:32.360
I'm sorry.

05:32.361 --> 05:34.862
But you-- I know you
guys keep saying that.

05:34.863 --> 05:36.064
Sorry.

05:36.065 --> 05:39.234
You keep saying that,
but it takes time,

05:39.235 --> 05:42.137
because I have to, obviously,
raise the money

05:42.138 --> 05:46.408
for my own post-education,
right?

05:46.409 --> 05:50.378
So the deal was is that
I would do that by own,

05:50.379 --> 05:52.213
do my best to
save up that money.

05:52.214 --> 05:55.283
In the meantime,
I would stay with you guys.

05:55.284 --> 05:57.852
How about putting some of that
money into some rent?

05:57.853 --> 05:59.637
What did I do last month?

05:59.638 --> 06:01.472
We talked about the fridge.

06:01.473 --> 06:03.274
Remember, when you
first suggested it?

06:03.275 --> 06:04.559
I said I didn't--
Honey, what did--

06:04.560 --> 06:07.578
And then you said that that
would buy me some--

06:07.579 --> 06:10.315
That's a classic guilt trip by
the way, and I appreciate that.

06:10.316 --> 06:11.715
No, but he did say--

06:11.716 --> 06:13.684
I know what you're doing.
You learned from the best.

06:13.685 --> 06:15.053
If you guys want me
to go back to school,

06:15.054 --> 06:17.055
then obviously I have to have a
little bit of money

06:17.056 --> 06:19.190
to do that too.

06:19.191 --> 06:22.126
Look, honestly, Bill,
you don't want to be the--

06:22.127 --> 06:23.361
We shouldn't have
gotten into it now,

06:23.362 --> 06:24.862
because you and I--
we have to go.

06:24.863 --> 06:26.730
Yeah.

06:26.731 --> 06:27.798
I'm just saying--
I'm just saying, okay--

06:27.799 --> 06:29.400
5 o'clock, mister,

06:29.401 --> 06:31.485
we're going to have
a roundtable discussion.

06:31.486 --> 06:33.087
Do me a favour.

06:33.088 --> 06:34.688
Do me a favour. Do me a favour.

06:34.689 --> 06:36.407
--you guys need to
help me out a little.

06:36.408 --> 06:37.425
Give me a call at work.
Give me a call at work.

06:37.426 --> 06:39.427
We're going to-- we're going to
have a bite to eat.

06:39.428 --> 06:40.895
We'll grab some lunch.

06:40.896 --> 06:42.030
We'll grab a newspaper.

06:42.031 --> 06:43.631
We'll go look at some
apartments,

06:43.632 --> 06:45.934
and we'll have you in a new
place by the end of the week.

06:45.935 --> 06:49.604
Okay, just as long as you're
paying for the lunch, because--

06:50.405 --> 06:52.805
Man.
Now, you guys. You...

06:52.942 --> 06:55.777
You can push each other's
buttons like no one,

06:55.778 --> 06:57.979
birds of a feather.

06:57.980 --> 07:02.083
I'm fine. I thought we had a
good situation, but obviously--

07:02.084 --> 07:05.419
We have a good situation.
But let's not make it a bad one.

07:05.420 --> 07:06.854
That's what we're saying.

07:06.855 --> 07:08.422
We're going to help you out
for the first--

07:08.423 --> 07:09.958
for the first couple
of years, okay?

07:09.959 --> 07:11.759
We will help you out.

07:11.760 --> 07:13.360
I'm not saying that we're
going to pay 100%,

07:13.361 --> 07:14.595
but we will help you out.

07:14.596 --> 07:16.531
Okay, here's what
we're going to do.

07:16.532 --> 07:18.433
We're going to meet here. I'm
going to pick up some pizzas,

07:18.434 --> 07:20.267
and then we're going to sit
and have a nice discussion.

07:20.268 --> 07:21.636
But I have to go.

07:21.637 --> 07:23.103
I mean, if you guys are willing
to help me out, I'm cool.

07:23.104 --> 07:24.371
Yeah.

07:24.372 --> 07:25.840
Okay?
Yeah.

07:25.841 --> 07:27.207
We still love you, man.
It's not to, you know--

07:27.208 --> 07:29.510
I know.

07:29.511 --> 07:31.078
Okay, have a good one today.
Okay?

07:31.079 --> 07:32.146
Okay.

07:32.147 --> 07:33.147
Give me a call at work.

07:33.148 --> 07:34.649
Be safe.

08:32.307 --> 08:36.159
There you go, enjoy.

08:36.160 --> 08:37.294
Hey, how are you doing?

08:37.294 --> 08:38.563
Good, man.

08:38.563 --> 08:40.698
A double espresso macchiato
with extra foam.

08:40.698 --> 08:43.534
Sure, that will be $4.50.

08:47.272 --> 08:49.157
There you go.
Thanks, man.

08:54.530 --> 08:55.896
Extra foam, man.

08:55.897 --> 08:57.782
You got it.

09:02.854 --> 09:05.840
There you go.

09:05.841 --> 09:07.942
That's not what I ordered, man.

09:07.943 --> 09:09.711
Yeah, it is.

09:09.712 --> 09:12.580
That's not a macchiato.
There's no foam in there at all.

09:12.581 --> 09:13.981
Yeah, there is.
There's some right there.

09:13.982 --> 09:15.149
No, no, no.

09:15.150 --> 09:16.984
No, a lot of foam,
a lot of foam.

09:16.985 --> 09:19.720
Dude, look,
this is like half milk.

09:19.721 --> 09:21.122
That's not a macchiato.

09:21.123 --> 09:23.124
Look, there's--
there's foam in there.

09:26.694 --> 09:27.995
There you go, more foam.

09:27.996 --> 09:30.298
Yeah, but take-- take some of
the milk out of it, man.

09:30.299 --> 09:31.365
I'm not taking any
of the milk out.

09:31.366 --> 09:33.634
That's a perfectly good
macchiato.

09:33.635 --> 09:34.768
Give me back my money, man.

09:34.769 --> 09:35.769
I'm not giving you--

09:35.770 --> 09:36.804
Give me back my money.

09:36.805 --> 09:38.239
I'm not giving you
your money back.

09:38.240 --> 09:39.673
Just take your coffee.

09:39.674 --> 09:41.275
I'm not paying for something
that I didn't order, man.

09:41.276 --> 09:42.410
Give me back my money.

09:42.411 --> 09:44.145
I make the best
coffees in this town.

09:44.146 --> 09:45.279
Take your coffee and go.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.880
I don't give a f--
what you make, bro.

09:46.881 --> 09:48.833
But I didn't-- I didn't order
this, so I don't want it.

09:48.834 --> 09:50.234
I don't care.

09:50.235 --> 09:51.769
That's a good coffee.
Take it.

09:51.770 --> 09:54.939
You know, just take it and shove
it up your ass, all right?

10:00.362 --> 10:02.363
Fucking idiot, man.

10:07.753 --> 10:11.188
Hey, man, you don't want
to give me back my $4.50?

10:11.189 --> 10:14.075
You don't want to give
me back my $4.50?

10:14.076 --> 10:15.076
No.

10:15.077 --> 10:16.077
No?

10:16.078 --> 10:18.079
No.

10:19.781 --> 10:20.815
All right, man.

10:20.816 --> 10:22.549
Here, take a--

10:22.550 --> 10:25.786
take a fucking roll while you're
going out the door.

10:29.574 --> 10:30.808
Fuck.

10:51.613 --> 10:52.847
<i>Bill!</i>

10:53.248 --> 10:54.449
Bill!

10:55.450 --> 10:56.450
Bill!

10:58.520 --> 10:59.987
Bill!
Yeah, what?

10:59.988 --> 11:02.139
Come on. Your lunch has been
over like 15 minutes ago.

11:02.140 --> 11:04.424
What do you mean? I took my
lunch break 15 minutes ago.

11:04.525 --> 11:06.878
Bill, take the mask off.
I've got tons of cars in there,

11:06.879 --> 11:09.714
and you're wasting
time on this van?

11:09.715 --> 11:11.682
All right?

11:11.683 --> 11:12.566
I already finished
3 cars today, Jim.

11:12.567 --> 11:14.869
Yeah, yeah. 3 cars?

11:15.370 --> 11:17.373
Come on. Get in there.

11:18.374 --> 11:20.741
Okay, the clock says work, work.

11:20.742 --> 11:22.910
Okay, you should check
your clocks, though.

11:22.911 --> 11:25.095
Maybe I should clock you.

11:28.784 --> 11:32.836
I don't think you should treat
your best worker like that, Jim.

11:32.837 --> 11:34.104
Bill, just get in there and make
some money for us, okay?

11:34.105 --> 11:36.257
How about a raise?

11:36.258 --> 11:37.525
Yeah, Bill?
Why don't you fuck off?

11:37.526 --> 11:38.526
9 bucks.

11:38.527 --> 11:40.461
Yeah, 9 bucks.

11:59.664 --> 12:03.166
That's it, yeah. Right.

12:03.167 --> 12:05.168
It's all prepped and ready.

12:22.170 --> 12:24.805
The stresses from war
do not make a man do this.

12:24.806 --> 12:28.492
What makes a man do this are
shame and rage.

12:28.493 --> 12:30.611
<i>What do you do when
the sun sets?</i>

12:30.612 --> 12:32.880
<i>Gonne get down
when the sun sets.</i>

12:32.881 --> 12:34.048
Yeah!

12:34.049 --> 12:36.083
Late.

12:36.084 --> 12:38.552
Sorry, I'm late.

12:38.553 --> 12:40.955
The funniest thing is that you
and this piece of shit--

12:40.956 --> 12:43.157
only you would do a burn out

12:43.158 --> 12:44.525
coming into a
shit hole like this.

12:44.526 --> 12:46.227
Yeah, it's $300.

12:46.228 --> 12:48.979
I know you've got to work for
6 months to make that, but...

12:50.432 --> 12:53.601
Hey, I got you a present.

12:53.602 --> 12:54.836
Why? What the fuck, man?

12:54.837 --> 12:56.203
Read up.

12:56.204 --> 12:58.339
Listen, by the way, you've got
to stop having these things

12:58.340 --> 12:59.540
sent to my fucking house, man.

12:59.541 --> 13:01.308
Yes, these are
the last ones, man.

13:01.309 --> 13:03.243
Yeah, but my dad
is getting pissed, okay?

13:03.244 --> 13:05.346
And what the fuck is in this?

13:05.347 --> 13:07.047
What did he say?

13:07.048 --> 13:08.716
He was asking what it was.

13:08.717 --> 13:10.417
What did you tell him?

13:10.418 --> 13:11.819
To mind his own
fucking business.

13:11.820 --> 13:15.255
Good, good.

13:15.256 --> 13:17.174
No one can know.
It's a surprise.

13:17.175 --> 13:18.875
Piece of shit.
Watch your head.

13:21.697 --> 13:24.565
Fuck. Yeah!

13:24.566 --> 13:26.266
Let's go eat.

13:26.267 --> 13:27.935
Do you really want
to fucking eat

13:27.936 --> 13:29.470
in this shit hole Chicken Den
piece of shit?

13:29.471 --> 13:32.857
This is America, man.
This is what we eat, okay?

13:32.858 --> 13:33.858
I love it.

13:33.859 --> 13:35.092
Dude, Chicken Den?

13:35.093 --> 13:36.193
Do you know what they do with
these animals?

13:36.194 --> 13:37.494
It's all-American.
This is America, baby.

13:37.495 --> 13:38.712
They sit in cages,
sitting in their shit all day.

13:38.713 --> 13:40.732
You're such a fucking prick.

13:42.233 --> 13:43.366
How are you doing?

13:43.367 --> 13:45.135
Welcome to Chicken Den.
How may I help you?

13:45.136 --> 13:46.637
Give me...

13:46.938 --> 13:49.006
Give me the 4-piece,

13:49.507 --> 13:51.008
a 4-piece mixed meat.

13:51.009 --> 13:52.009
Do you want the combo?

13:52.010 --> 13:53.477
Combo.

13:53.478 --> 13:57.181
Fuck.

13:57.182 --> 14:01.785
A salad, a garden salad.

14:01.786 --> 14:03.454
A 4-piece combo?
Hi, sorry.

14:03.455 --> 14:04.988
A 4-piece combo, you said?

14:04.989 --> 14:06.123
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.

14:06.124 --> 14:08.543
You're just going to have salad?

14:08.544 --> 14:11.078
Draw cartoon chickens
saying, "Eat me."

14:11.079 --> 14:12.379
$10.70, please.

14:12.380 --> 14:13.380
Yes, ma'am.

14:19.721 --> 14:22.456
How is your day, love?

14:22.457 --> 14:24.291
Perfect. How is yours?

14:24.292 --> 14:26.777
Sunshine and rainbows.

14:29.781 --> 14:32.516
A combo and a salad.

14:32.517 --> 14:34.085
She seem a little bit pissed off?

14:34.086 --> 14:35.953
Yeah.
Thank you.

14:35.954 --> 14:36.954
High-five.

14:36.955 --> 14:38.322
Don't leave me hanging.

14:41.994 --> 14:43.361
This is a fresh, fresh salad.

14:43.362 --> 14:45.696
I'll bet they went out and
picked it this morning.

14:45.697 --> 14:49.399
That looks disgusting.

14:49.400 --> 14:52.135
Your salad probably has bugs
crawling all over it.

14:52.136 --> 14:55.238
Dude, move this.

14:55.239 --> 14:56.406
You're going to knock
it off the fucking edge.

14:56.407 --> 14:58.108
So tomorrow, 1:00.

14:58.109 --> 14:59.443
Yeah. Tomorrow, 1:00.

14:59.444 --> 15:01.011
Paintball, right?
No problems with work?

15:01.012 --> 15:02.847
Dude, I've got to call in sick.

15:02.848 --> 15:04.081
You haven't done that yet?

15:04.082 --> 15:06.684
Well, dude, I have
to call it on the day.

15:06.685 --> 15:08.151
I'm not going to
call today and say,

15:08.152 --> 15:10.253
"Listen, tomorrow I'm not going
to be in, because I'm sick."

15:10.254 --> 15:12.490
I talked to you about
this 2 weeks ago.

15:12.491 --> 15:14.057
Yeah, I have to call in
tomorrow.

15:14.058 --> 15:15.459
I said, you said--

15:15.460 --> 15:17.260
Can I have the tray?

15:17.261 --> 15:18.896
I took the day off work too.
We have to play.

15:18.897 --> 15:21.332
Holy shit!

15:21.333 --> 15:23.334
Crap!

15:25.770 --> 15:28.238
Would you get me a napkin?

15:28.239 --> 15:29.406
Like, she didn't even say
anything.

15:29.407 --> 15:30.641
She didn't go, "I'm sorry."

15:30.642 --> 15:31.858
No like, "I'm sorry."

15:31.859 --> 15:34.061
Hi!
You brought napkins.

15:34.062 --> 15:36.697
No, no. We'll probably need
like-- I don't know-- a mop.

15:36.698 --> 15:37.931
Are you going to apologize?

15:37.932 --> 15:39.400
I mean, you fucking got
this shit all over us.

15:39.401 --> 15:40.835
Look, I'm sorry.

15:40.836 --> 15:42.002
I'm laughing because you got it
on him, and he's a prick.

15:42.003 --> 15:44.037
Could you
get me more chicken,

15:44.038 --> 15:45.172
because this is right
all over the place.

15:45.173 --> 15:46.107
Yeah, I'll make that.

15:46.108 --> 15:47.224
What's your problem?

15:47.225 --> 15:48.225
I don't have a problem.
I'm sorry.

15:48.226 --> 15:49.676
Is there something
wrong with you?

15:49.677 --> 15:50.828
Look, I'll get
this replaced. That's fine.

15:50.829 --> 15:52.329
She's upset with her life.

15:52.330 --> 15:54.164
Jesus!

15:54.165 --> 15:55.082
Can I get my money back?

15:55.083 --> 15:56.767
Look, I'll get you more stuff,

15:56.768 --> 15:58.069
but I'm not giving
you your money back.

15:58.070 --> 15:59.203
I don't want more stuff.

15:59.204 --> 16:01.405
I'm sorry I dumped stuff on you,

16:01.406 --> 16:02.672
but I'll just have
it replaced, okay?

16:02.673 --> 16:04.141
Lady!

16:04.142 --> 16:05.909
It's okay.

16:05.910 --> 16:07.344
Do you have a manager?

16:07.345 --> 16:08.712
Hey, it's okay. It's all right.
Don't worry about it.

16:08.713 --> 16:10.881
Hold on. No, no, no.
Do you have a manager?

16:10.882 --> 16:13.250
Don't worry about it. It's fine.
It will dry.

16:13.251 --> 16:16.486
This is why I don't want to eat
in these fucking places, man.

16:16.487 --> 16:17.755
Look at this shit.

16:17.756 --> 16:18.889
Do you think she likes it?

16:18.890 --> 16:20.725
Dude, do you think that I like

16:20.726 --> 16:24.461
having whatever-the-fuck this
kind of salad is,

16:24.462 --> 16:29.033
this salad dressing,
extra ranch?

16:29.034 --> 16:31.268
Is this quality service?

16:31.269 --> 16:32.536
Hello? Hello?

16:36.391 --> 16:39.126
Yeah, don't forget
the tray, right?

16:41.079 --> 16:44.198
That's great. It's all clean.

16:44.199 --> 16:46.366
Thank you.

16:46.367 --> 16:47.467
Like, take this guy.

16:47.468 --> 16:49.820
You see him walking
down the street?

16:49.821 --> 16:51.505
Smile on his face.

16:51.506 --> 16:54.391
He's got nice clothes on.

16:54.392 --> 16:56.393
What's he doing? What do you
think he does?

16:56.394 --> 16:59.963
I don't know. What's he do?

16:59.964 --> 17:01.932
Maybe a banker.

17:01.933 --> 17:03.501
He's delirious, though.

17:03.502 --> 17:06.604
Maybe a travelling salesman?

17:06.605 --> 17:09.205
He's delirious, why?

17:09.207 --> 17:10.807
That guy helps to
wreck the economy.

17:10.808 --> 17:12.476
He helps to wreck the world.

17:12.477 --> 17:16.814
He eats in Styrofoam
fucking cups.

17:16.815 --> 17:18.949
He's terrible, delirious.

17:18.950 --> 17:21.351
That's not what the world needs.

17:21.352 --> 17:23.203
What does the world need?

17:23.204 --> 17:25.038
The world needs change, man.

17:25.039 --> 17:27.007
What kind of change?

17:27.008 --> 17:30.911
Who is going to do it?

17:30.912 --> 17:32.312
Dude, the problem is--

17:32.313 --> 17:34.147
As one person,
what could you do?

17:34.148 --> 17:35.916
--that this fucking world grows

17:35.917 --> 17:38.035
by like 70 million people a year.
That's the problem.

17:38.036 --> 17:40.304
There's too many people.

17:40.305 --> 17:42.272
And so our natural resources
are running out.

17:42.273 --> 17:44.708
And no one, and no one--
look, we have trains.

17:44.709 --> 17:47.711
We have-- we have cars,
tons of cars

17:47.712 --> 17:50.680
that are just burning up gas and
making this place disgusting.

17:50.681 --> 17:52.149
We've got a hole in the ozone.

17:52.150 --> 17:54.218
Blah, blah, blah.

17:54.219 --> 17:57.188
You have chicken that looks
like-- yeah, of course, man.

17:57.189 --> 17:58.989
It's just disgusting.
That's all.

17:58.990 --> 18:01.024
It's just absolutely
fucking sick.

18:01.025 --> 18:03.060
It makes me just sick.

18:03.061 --> 18:05.629
But what are you supposed
to do, stop living?

18:05.630 --> 18:07.848
There's 2 kinds of people--
leavers and takers.

18:07.849 --> 18:11.868
And the leavers coexist.

18:11.869 --> 18:14.704
We need people that coexist.

18:14.705 --> 18:18.008
And the takers is the
society of the world.

18:18.009 --> 18:20.411
The takers is the
people that fucking--

18:20.412 --> 18:25.349
that just, like, drive
Ferraris not caring.

18:25.350 --> 18:26.867
Because people
have to make money.

18:26.868 --> 18:28.769
No, people don't
have to make money.

18:28.770 --> 18:30.271
People have to make money.

18:30.272 --> 18:31.738
That's the thing. That's what
I'm talking about, man.

18:31.739 --> 18:33.373
People don't have to.

18:33.374 --> 18:35.042
That's the thing that society
drills in your head

18:35.043 --> 18:36.844
over and over and over since
you've been fucking 5-years-old

18:36.845 --> 18:38.545
that you have to have
a big bank account.

18:38.546 --> 18:39.880
You have to make a lot of money.
You have to have a fast car.

18:39.881 --> 18:42.749
It makes life a lot easier,
doesn't it?

18:42.750 --> 18:44.084
Dude, but what happens--

18:44.085 --> 18:46.320
Would you want to be poor?
Do you want to be poor?

18:46.321 --> 18:47.855
Do you want to have no money?

18:47.856 --> 18:49.890
You keep going down this road.
Do you know where it's going?

18:49.891 --> 18:51.658
So you just think just keep
going down the reckless path,

18:51.659 --> 18:54.078
just fucking-- pile straight
ahead, because there's no--

18:54.079 --> 18:55.245
We're all just fucked.

18:55.246 --> 18:56.513
What's the point?

18:56.514 --> 18:57.747
That's the most pessimistic
point of view

18:57.748 --> 18:59.149
I've ever heard in my life.

18:59.150 --> 19:02.836
You're a prodigy of the world,
my son, a prodigy of the world.

19:02.837 --> 19:04.504
You're all talk, buddy.
You're all talk.

19:04.805 --> 19:06.090
Snap.

19:06.391 --> 19:08.859
All talk?

19:08.860 --> 19:10.393
All talk, no action.

19:39.174 --> 19:41.641
That's helping. I stood on my
feet all day today.

19:41.642 --> 19:45.245
Not to change the subject,
but when is dinner?

19:45.246 --> 19:46.647
No-- hi.

19:46.648 --> 19:49.283
Hey, hey, hey.

19:49.284 --> 19:50.317
Yeah?

19:50.318 --> 19:52.069
No phone call?

19:52.070 --> 19:53.270
Sorry.

19:53.271 --> 19:54.288
Where have you been?

19:54.289 --> 19:55.389
What are you guys doing?

19:55.390 --> 19:56.456
What do you mean,
what have we been doing?

19:56.457 --> 19:57.858
We've been waiting for you?

19:57.859 --> 20:00.076
Remember, we had this meeting
planned, right?

20:00.077 --> 20:01.077
I was going to pick up pizza--

20:01.078 --> 20:02.379
How long is
it going to take?

20:03.880 --> 20:04.815
Come on.

20:04.816 --> 20:06.718
It's just going to
take as long as it takes.

20:06.819 --> 20:10.688
No, no, no, no.
Can we do it tomorrow morning?

20:11.189 --> 20:14.625
I've got some very exciting
news for you guys,

20:14.626 --> 20:18.812
and I actually ate at the
Chicken Den--

20:18.813 --> 20:20.581
Come on, Bill.

20:20.582 --> 20:21.982
We organized this.

20:21.983 --> 20:23.083
I know.

20:23.084 --> 20:24.652
We talked about it this
morning, remember?

20:24.653 --> 20:26.754
It was like 9 hours ago.

20:26.755 --> 20:28.088
Tomorrow--
Jeez.

20:28.089 --> 20:29.489
We'll talk about
it at breakfast,

20:29.490 --> 20:32.226
and I've got very, very exciting
news for you guys, okay?

20:32.227 --> 20:34.528
Okay, are you going to
be on time for once?

20:34.529 --> 20:35.595
Yes, on time.

20:35.596 --> 20:36.730
That's exciting news.

20:36.731 --> 20:37.798
Okay, well, I will make a
special breakfast.

20:37.799 --> 20:42.202
No-- no coping out this time.

20:42.203 --> 20:43.854
No, absolutely, I'll see you
tomorrow morning.

20:43.855 --> 20:46.089
You promise?

20:46.090 --> 20:47.858
Promise. Good night, guys.

20:49.209 --> 20:51.362
I kind of figured
that would happen.

20:51.363 --> 20:53.530
Yeah, that's typical.

20:53.531 --> 20:57.968
That's typical, every,
every time.

20:57.969 --> 20:59.820
Why is he resisting
this so much?

20:59.821 --> 21:00.988
I don't know.

21:00.989 --> 21:03.457
Do you think he's hiding
something? Is he okay?

21:03.458 --> 21:05.492
I just think he's--

21:05.493 --> 21:07.828
Psychiatrist Michelle His tow
has a theory about Kyle.

21:07.829 --> 21:12.449
When I saw him, he had already
murdered 7 people.

21:12.450 --> 21:15.685
Our work is gripping and
unpredictable.

21:15.686 --> 21:19.423
This is not the way
conventional psychiatry works.

21:19.424 --> 21:22.292
Up next, an interview with
Michelle His tow.

22:05.653 --> 22:08.288
We have the right to drive
whenever, wherever,

22:08.289 --> 22:11.024
and whatever we want, but we
need to understand the effects

22:11.025 --> 22:12.458
of the carbon footprint

22:12.459 --> 22:13.927
and realize the
environmental damage

22:13.928 --> 22:15.712
cars are causing
to our planet.

22:15.713 --> 22:18.132
Al Qaeda is all over Iraq.

22:18.133 --> 22:19.599
The administration
of the U.S. president

22:19.600 --> 22:21.535
will likely
double the bounty on...

22:21.536 --> 22:23.270
The BTK killer has confessed

22:23.271 --> 22:25.038
to killing 10 people and
tonight...

22:25.039 --> 22:27.173
The United States will deploy
30,000 additional troops...

22:27.174 --> 22:30.845
The global population grows by
over 70 million people a year.

22:30.946 --> 22:33.547
At the same time, our natural
resources are dwindling-- coal,

22:33.648 --> 22:35.449
oil, gas, water.

22:35.450 --> 22:37.184
Okay, and with the development
of the third world

22:37.185 --> 22:39.086
we're just creating a ticking
time bomb,

22:39.087 --> 22:42.689
and even though we know that
forests are essential

22:42.690 --> 22:46.844
to reducing carbon emissions,
we continue to cut them down,

22:46.845 --> 22:51.548
whether it's for housing,
farming, alternative energy,

22:51.549 --> 22:53.249
or just useless furniture

22:53.250 --> 22:56.319
instead of truly getting
together and fighting

22:56.320 --> 22:59.540
for something, fighting
against global warming,

22:59.541 --> 23:03.110
against political
and social unrest.

23:03.111 --> 23:06.113
Our politicians are using the
same lame band-aid techniques

23:06.114 --> 23:09.466
up for re-elections,
over and over.

23:09.467 --> 23:11.702
What we need is change.

23:11.703 --> 23:13.537
We can't stand
for this anymore.

23:13.538 --> 23:16.055
Any why do we accept this?

23:16.056 --> 23:18.525
Because we're a society
built on wants.

23:18.526 --> 23:19.760
Not needs.

23:19.761 --> 23:21.995
What are we taught
to want from childhood?

23:22.196 --> 23:24.464
Big bank accounts.

23:24.465 --> 23:29.102
Fast cars, plasma screen TVs,
liposuction.

23:29.103 --> 23:30.470
Okay, facelifts.

23:30.471 --> 23:32.272
Does this help anyone? No.

23:32.273 --> 23:35.074
What is this? This is ego.

23:35.075 --> 23:38.178
This doesn't help the world.

23:38.179 --> 23:40.280
We need to bind together.

23:40.281 --> 23:41.715
We don't need to be
individuals.

23:41.716 --> 23:46.670
We need to become whole as a
country, as world.

23:46.671 --> 23:49.540
We need someone who
will stand for something.

23:49.541 --> 23:52.776
We need someone who
believes in what they say

23:52.777 --> 23:55.262
and believes in actions
changing the way

23:55.263 --> 23:56.897
that we view our world.

24:31.282 --> 24:35.301
We can't survive with our
politicians focusing their time

24:35.302 --> 24:37.270
on fighting religious wars,

24:37.271 --> 24:40.907
fighting over control
of natural resources.

24:40.908 --> 24:44.077
Can anyone do this?

24:44.078 --> 24:46.580
Well, I don't know.

24:46.581 --> 24:48.448
Do you have any thoughts?

24:49.951 --> 24:54.521
We're so precious, aren't we?

24:54.522 --> 24:56.456
Everyone has got to live.

24:56.457 --> 24:58.892
Everyone has got to be happy.

24:58.893 --> 25:01.761
It's a joke.

25:01.762 --> 25:03.497
It's an absolute joke.

25:03.498 --> 25:05.515
Humanity can't survive
over the next 100 years.

25:05.516 --> 25:07.016
The facts don't lie.

25:07.017 --> 25:09.619
We need someone who will
stand for something.

25:09.620 --> 25:12.906
We need someone who
believes in what they say

25:12.907 --> 25:15.809
and believes in action,
believes in positive action.

25:15.810 --> 25:20.614
It's an absolute joke.

25:20.615 --> 25:23.617
Evan, that's what
you didn't get.

25:23.618 --> 25:25.151
That's what you didn't get.

25:25.152 --> 25:27.587
You think people are equal.
They're not.

25:27.588 --> 25:30.673
They're not.

25:55.283 --> 25:57.550
...just like President Richard Nixon
did to the Vietnamese

25:57.551 --> 25:59.152
back in the late '60s--

25:59.153 --> 26:01.505
Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda,

26:01.506 --> 26:03.707
these people are out
to kill us. People don't--

26:03.708 --> 26:05.475
All of these things
contribute

26:05.476 --> 26:07.844
to the problem of
overpopulation.

26:07.845 --> 26:09.446
People don't comprehend
the danger

26:09.447 --> 26:12.015
that this country
creates for the world.

26:12.016 --> 26:14.851
If just 15 millilitres is
released and becomes airborne,

26:14.852 --> 26:16.853
this chemical could kill a
million people.

26:16.854 --> 26:19.790
--About society and people
in the humanitarian sense.

26:19.791 --> 26:21.024
We need to changes
to protect the--

26:27.281 --> 26:28.665
Thessalonians 3:10 says,

26:28.666 --> 26:31.985
"For even when we are with you,
this we commanded you,

26:31.986 --> 26:35.722
that if any would not work,
neither should he eat."

26:35.723 --> 26:38.508
The global population grows by
over 70 million people a year.

26:47.835 --> 26:50.203
And why do we accept this?

26:50.204 --> 26:52.939
Because we're a society
built on wants.

26:52.940 --> 26:55.374
Not needs. What are we taught
to want from childhood?

26:56.977 --> 26:59.078
Big bank accounts.

26:59.079 --> 27:02.231
Fast cars, plasma screen TVs,
liposuction.

27:02.232 --> 27:03.700
Okay, facelifts.

27:03.701 --> 27:05.301
Does this help anyone? No.

27:05.302 --> 27:07.320
What is this? This is ego.

27:07.321 --> 27:09.623
We need someone who
will stand for something.

27:09.624 --> 27:12.859
We need someone who
believes in what they say

27:12.860 --> 27:17.063
and believes in action,
believes in positive action

27:17.064 --> 27:18.882
and changing the way
that we look at things,

27:18.883 --> 27:22.052
changing the way that
we view our world.

27:22.053 --> 27:23.720
So that's what I'll do.

27:23.721 --> 27:24.854
My name is Evan Drince.

27:24.855 --> 27:26.856
Why not?

27:30.994 --> 27:32.828
Bill?

27:32.829 --> 27:34.213
Breakfast is ready, Bill.

27:36.817 --> 27:38.118
What?

27:38.119 --> 27:39.886
I said breakfast!

27:39.887 --> 27:42.122
I'll be up in 15 minutes!
I'm working out!

27:54.252 --> 27:55.685
Good morning, honey.

27:55.686 --> 27:57.754
Morning.
That smells really good.

27:57.755 --> 27:59.555
I'm glad we're actually having a
nice breakfast together,

27:59.556 --> 28:02.409
because yesterday
was a bit tense.

28:02.410 --> 28:05.278
Well, you guys dropped a--
dropped a bomb on me.

28:05.279 --> 28:07.613
I know, but I feel like--

28:07.614 --> 28:10.250
I think we've reached some
kind of agreement, right?

28:10.251 --> 28:13.002
And today, what I'm
going to do for you guys

28:13.003 --> 28:16.256
is that I'm going
to be proactive.

28:16.257 --> 28:18.975
And today, I'm going to stay in.
I've got the day off.

28:18.976 --> 28:21.061
I'm going to fill out some
college applications,

28:21.062 --> 28:22.228
and I'm thinking--

28:22.229 --> 28:24.965
What did my ears just hear?

28:24.966 --> 28:29.069
That I'm going to fill out some
college applications,

28:29.070 --> 28:31.104
mechanical engineer.

28:31.105 --> 28:32.105
Honey!

28:32.106 --> 28:33.440
Who kidnapped our son?

28:33.441 --> 28:35.208
What's going on?
That's fantastic!

28:35.209 --> 28:36.776
Yeah, it makes sense, right?

28:36.777 --> 28:37.944
Okay, you know, I--

28:37.945 --> 28:39.512
That's fantastic. Good job.

28:39.513 --> 28:41.114
So are you guys happy?

28:41.115 --> 28:43.849
I've got to say
I'm really proud of you.

28:45.286 --> 28:47.019
Well, I think it's
about time, right?

28:47.020 --> 28:50.523
I think our little talk maybe
got in there somewhere?

28:50.524 --> 28:54.878
You guys kicked my little
tushie out the door.

28:54.879 --> 28:56.179
With love.

28:56.180 --> 28:57.881
Absolutely.

28:57.882 --> 28:58.831
You know what?
Here's the thing.

28:58.832 --> 29:00.367
You're going to feel better
about yourself

29:00.368 --> 29:02.168
once you have, like, goals.

29:02.169 --> 29:04.404
I know. I do have goals, Mom.

29:04.405 --> 29:06.205
Look, I've got to go.

29:06.206 --> 29:08.208
We'll talk about
it more later.

29:08.209 --> 29:09.209
Okay, chin up.

29:09.210 --> 29:10.776
Okay. Bye, Dad.

29:10.777 --> 29:12.128
Sweetheart, I'll see you later.

29:12.129 --> 29:14.698
Okay, we'll talk at dinner.

29:14.699 --> 29:15.765
I'm really, really
proud of you.

29:15.766 --> 29:17.266
I think what you're
going to feel

29:17.267 --> 29:21.705
is that you have goals in life
now and a direction.

29:21.706 --> 29:22.706
Right.

29:22.707 --> 29:23.973
Yeah.

29:23.974 --> 29:27.610
Yeah, I woke up today
feeling enthusiastic.

29:27.611 --> 29:31.113
My little boy,
he's growing up.

29:31.114 --> 29:33.032
Come here.

29:33.033 --> 29:37.570
It's out of love that we kick
your bum-- your bum.

29:37.571 --> 29:39.005
Sorry about the language.

29:39.006 --> 29:40.590
Have a good day at work, okay?

29:40.591 --> 29:43.309
I will, sweetheart.
I'm very excited for you,

29:43.310 --> 29:45.311
and I want to see how this turns
out with the applications.

29:45.312 --> 29:46.479
Okay.
Okay.

29:46.480 --> 29:47.480
I'll see you tonight.

29:47.481 --> 29:48.482
Bye, honey.

29:48.483 --> 29:51.485
All right.

29:51.586 --> 29:52.887
Evan,

29:53.506 --> 29:55.687
you think people are equal.
They're not.

29:56.008 --> 29:57.607
They're not.

29:58.108 --> 30:00.177
Evan, Evan, Evan, Evan.

30:01.378 --> 30:03.246
You're such an idiot.

30:04.147 --> 30:07.250
They're like a drop in a bucket.

30:07.251 --> 30:11.104
I just poured the bucket out.

30:11.105 --> 30:14.541
Yeah, you couldn't do anything.

30:14.542 --> 30:17.911
All you could do is talk--
meaningless.

30:17.912 --> 30:20.780
Do anything.

30:20.781 --> 30:24.684
Well, I guess I did.

30:24.685 --> 30:27.019
...shot about 5 or 6 times
and everybody...

30:27.020 --> 30:28.855
most of the shooting right
here at this location

30:28.856 --> 30:31.074
where most of the
bullet casings are...

30:31.075 --> 30:33.309
In nature, there's
survival of the fittest.

30:33.310 --> 30:36.229
What separates us
from the animals?

30:36.230 --> 30:39.181
It's our consciousness.

30:39.182 --> 30:40.916
It's our ego.

30:40.917 --> 30:43.052
It's our sense of self...

30:43.053 --> 30:47.022
So, all of a sudden, we care
about ourselves too much.

30:47.023 --> 30:50.293
We care about our
fellow man too much.

30:53.964 --> 30:55.632
We have to do anything that
we can to keep them alive.

30:55.633 --> 30:58.568
You know, the animals
just want to eat.

31:00.588 --> 31:02.154
They just want to eat.

31:02.155 --> 31:05.157
They'll kill you
so they can eat.

31:13.033 --> 31:14.667
Can anyone do this?

31:14.668 --> 31:16.669
I don't know.

31:16.670 --> 31:18.971
Do you have any thoughts?

31:28.465 --> 31:30.399
Let's face it.

31:30.400 --> 31:35.204
If we could just kill everybody,

31:35.205 --> 31:39.242
you know, in the third world,

31:39.243 --> 31:42.211
people with cancer, you know,

31:42.212 --> 31:45.115
people that are sucking up
our resources,

31:45.116 --> 31:47.050
maybe we could survive.

31:47.051 --> 31:48.417
The Bible says we must not kill...

31:48.418 --> 31:50.520
The bible says we must not
commit adultery.

31:50.521 --> 31:51.988
Most of the shooting right
here at this location

31:51.989 --> 31:53.156
where most of the bullet
casings are,

31:53.157 --> 31:54.490
and then ran off
in that direction

31:54.491 --> 31:55.925
while still shooting...

31:55.926 --> 31:59.663
Survival of the fittest is
really, is a real theory.

31:59.664 --> 32:03.599
That's a way to create balance.

32:03.600 --> 32:05.100
I don't believe in god.

32:05.101 --> 32:08.938
I believe in what I see,
the pain and suffering I see.

32:08.939 --> 32:10.506
I believe that when I go out in
the street

32:10.507 --> 32:12.074
and I see a mother who can't
feed her child...

32:12.075 --> 32:15.177
Described as a loner who never
fit in with his classmates...

32:15.178 --> 32:17.146
Couldn't do anything.

32:17.147 --> 32:19.816
All you could do was talk...
Meaningless.

33:13.354 --> 33:16.872
Don't forget Bingo
at Centerville Bingo Hall.

33:16.873 --> 33:18.874
Now back to the local news...

33:29.386 --> 33:31.008
The world needs change, man.

33:31.139 --> 33:34.690
What kind of change?
Who's going to do it? You?

33:38.662 --> 33:41.498
How long is it going to take?

33:42.399 --> 33:43.918
Can anyone do this?

33:45.019 --> 33:46.386
I don't know.

33:46.887 --> 33:48.905
Do you have any thoughts?

34:09.693 --> 34:12.746
All talk, no action.

34:23.524 --> 34:25.007
Start up.

34:27.261 --> 34:29.512
Here we go.

34:46.163 --> 34:49.415
Jesus.

34:49.416 --> 34:50.650
Fuck.

35:20.981 --> 35:23.082
Come out with your hands up!

35:26.419 --> 35:28.771
Open the back.

37:31.728 --> 37:33.062
Get down, you piece of shit!

37:33.063 --> 37:34.814
Get down!
On the ground!

37:38.702 --> 37:40.853
Get down!

37:44.792 --> 37:47.026
Down on the ground!

37:47.027 --> 37:49.545
Shit!

38:51.625 --> 38:53.142
Hi.

38:53.143 --> 38:54.994
You're scared as shit?

38:58.715 --> 39:00.049
Here we go.

39:00.050 --> 39:01.050
Please...

40:52.946 --> 40:54.746
Hey, man, how are you?

40:54.747 --> 40:57.333
Hey, man,
you remember me?

41:01.488 --> 41:06.442
Why don't you make me
a double espresso macchiato

41:06.443 --> 41:08.177
with extra foam?

41:08.178 --> 41:09.412
You got it.

41:10.714 --> 41:12.865
Why don't you make it like
your life depends on it?

41:17.470 --> 41:19.705
With extra foam!

41:25.895 --> 41:30.800
You like to take your sweet
fucking time, don't you?

41:30.801 --> 41:32.835
There you go.

41:42.763 --> 41:45.665
Why is this so difficult?

41:45.666 --> 41:50.419
I mean, how hard can it be?

41:50.420 --> 41:51.337
I'm going to give you 5 seconds

41:51.338 --> 41:52.672
to get the fuck out of here.

41:52.673 --> 41:55.040
I'm going to start counting
right now.

41:55.041 --> 41:56.275
1...

41:56.276 --> 41:57.643
Are you serious?

41:57.644 --> 42:01.246
Yeah, yeah!
I'm pretty fucking serious!

42:01.247 --> 42:02.515
1...

42:03.416 --> 42:05.502
2... hurry up, motherfucker!

42:06.603 --> 42:08.120
Run, Forrest!

42:08.121 --> 42:09.306
Now you're getting it!

42:09.607 --> 42:11.108
5, bitch!

42:33.479 --> 42:37.516
Again, we are strongly advising
people to stay inside,

42:37.517 --> 42:41.220
as early reports indicate that
chaos in downtown Centerville

42:41.221 --> 42:44.089
is caused by a
heavily-armed individual

42:44.090 --> 42:46.458
firing randomly
at innocent bystanders.

42:46.459 --> 42:49.995
Hello, beautiful ladies.

42:53.266 --> 42:54.633
Hold on a minute.

42:54.634 --> 42:56.568
No, calm down. No, no.

42:56.569 --> 43:01.240
You get over there.
You get over there.

43:01.241 --> 43:04.576
Hey, ladies. Out of the kitchen.

43:04.577 --> 43:06.245
Go join your pretty friends.

43:06.246 --> 43:07.446
You too.

43:07.447 --> 43:09.514
Come on.

43:09.515 --> 43:11.116
Let's go.

43:11.117 --> 43:13.285
There you go. Come on.

43:13.286 --> 43:14.453
You too, Blondie.

43:14.454 --> 43:17.356
Who else is here?

43:17.357 --> 43:18.657
There's no one else here.

43:18.658 --> 43:19.658
No one?

43:19.659 --> 43:20.659
It's just us here.

43:20.660 --> 43:22.261
What about this door?

43:22.262 --> 43:23.528
Come on, ladies.

43:23.529 --> 43:25.530
Come over here. Get down.

43:41.648 --> 43:43.215
It gets so hot in this thing.

43:52.842 --> 43:54.009
I have my cell phone here.

44:18.652 --> 44:19.985
I've got--
I've got 2 kids at home.

44:19.986 --> 44:21.953
I've got a husband.
I've got--

44:23.790 --> 44:26.775
Please! Let us go!
What is it you...

44:44.311 --> 44:46.862
I feel nauseous.

44:58.057 --> 44:59.658
Come on...

45:05.131 --> 45:06.965
My God!

45:10.237 --> 45:13.839
Is everybody okay?

45:13.840 --> 45:16.308
What a fucking dickhead!

45:16.309 --> 45:18.277
Are you guys okay?

45:18.278 --> 45:19.478
Holy shit!

45:19.479 --> 45:21.113
My God! Does anybody have--

45:21.114 --> 45:24.015
Where's the phone?

45:28.622 --> 45:30.923
Everyone over here!

45:30.924 --> 45:32.892
Over here!

45:32.893 --> 45:33.926
Get down!

45:33.927 --> 45:35.261
Get down! Get down!

45:35.262 --> 45:38.764
Please!

45:38.765 --> 45:41.516
I don't know why I did that.

45:41.517 --> 45:45.721
Maybe I shouldn't
have taken off my mask.

45:45.722 --> 45:48.624
Please, don't do it. Please!

45:48.625 --> 45:49.975
I have to.

46:17.220 --> 46:19.221
O-67. Six seven.

46:23.793 --> 46:25.794
G-54. Five four.

47:23.269 --> 47:25.075
Hey, buddy,

47:25.706 --> 47:28.775
I'm a little bit peckish.
You got something to eat?

47:30.376 --> 47:33.262
Why don't you get me the best
sandwich you've got?

47:33.563 --> 47:36.398
The best, tastiest
sandwich you've got.

47:36.399 --> 47:38.199
What have you got
to drink, iced tea?

47:43.306 --> 47:46.625
That looks like shit.

47:46.626 --> 47:48.060
Here you go.

47:48.061 --> 47:50.129
That's a nice hairnet.
Do they make you wear that?

47:50.130 --> 47:51.230
Yeah, thanks.

47:51.231 --> 47:53.032
Free of charge. Just--

47:53.033 --> 47:55.234
Good. I completely
forgot my wallet.

47:55.235 --> 47:56.635
Right.

47:56.636 --> 47:59.638
Thank you.

47:59.639 --> 48:01.006
Have a good day.

48:01.007 --> 48:02.841
Thank you for coming to
Centerville Bingo

48:02.842 --> 48:05.377

49:07.388 --> 49:09.524
O-70. Seven zero.

49:12.294 --> 49:14.596
Excuse me! Sir, I need that!

49:14.597 --> 49:17.833
I-27. I-27!

49:17.834 --> 49:20.669
I need that back, please, sir.

49:20.670 --> 49:21.903
It's I-27!

49:21.904 --> 49:23.071
Excuse me...

49:23.072 --> 49:26.608
I-27! Bingo!

49:26.609 --> 49:29.678
Bingo?

49:29.679 --> 49:31.780
No Bingo.

49:47.297 --> 49:50.632
You guys don't need
my help at all.

50:09.652 --> 50:14.623
I-27. Two seven.

50:32.325 --> 50:34.709
And we are still getting reports
that a brown van

50:34.710 --> 50:37.445
was seen smashing into the
front of the police station

50:37.446 --> 50:39.181
just moments before
the massive explosion

50:39.182 --> 50:42.401
that woke Centerville
residents up this morning.

50:56.299 --> 50:59.601
Everybody get
behind the counter.

50:59.602 --> 51:01.570
Ladies, back the fuck up!

51:01.571 --> 51:04.056
Nobody presses the alarm!
Let's go!

51:04.057 --> 51:05.173
Ladies, back the fuck up!

51:05.174 --> 51:07.726
Don't touch those alarms!

51:07.727 --> 51:09.861
You too.

51:09.862 --> 51:12.264
Let's go, big shot.

51:12.265 --> 51:14.583
Don't be scared, big shot.

51:14.584 --> 51:16.601
Let's go. Come on.

51:27.530 --> 51:28.964
Get him!

51:34.554 --> 51:36.087
What the fuck was that?!

51:43.246 --> 51:47.482
Anybody else want
to play hero?

51:47.483 --> 51:49.518
No?

52:12.525 --> 52:15.244
Knock, knock, knock,
Mr. Manager.

52:15.245 --> 52:16.511
What are you doing in here?

52:16.512 --> 52:18.780
Give me your fucking phone!

52:18.781 --> 52:21.649
Everyone is out there.
What are you doing in here?

52:21.650 --> 52:23.918
Get the fuck out here! Come on!

52:23.919 --> 52:25.787
Come on!

52:25.788 --> 52:27.889
What do I want?
What do you think I want?

52:27.890 --> 52:28.890
Money.

52:28.891 --> 52:30.292
Come on, quick.
Money, money.

52:30.293 --> 52:32.394
Money?
You're a smart one, genius.

52:32.395 --> 52:33.395
Get in the back!

52:33.396 --> 52:34.429
It's in the safe.

52:34.430 --> 52:35.730
Where? In the safe? Go!

52:35.731 --> 52:37.099
I don't have the key.
I don't have the key.

52:37.100 --> 52:38.400
You don't have the fucking key?
Where is the fucking key?

52:38.401 --> 52:39.401
In my office.

52:39.402 --> 52:41.086
Go get it.

52:41.087 --> 52:43.054
Don't fuck around!

52:43.055 --> 52:47.058
You, you work here or do you
just dress like an idiot?

52:47.059 --> 52:49.361
Empty the registers, fuck face.

52:49.362 --> 52:51.162
Empty the registers.

52:51.163 --> 52:52.564
You look like a fucking idiot
when you're scared,

52:52.565 --> 52:54.466
you know that?

52:54.467 --> 52:57.168
I have the key.
I've got the key!

52:57.169 --> 53:00.639
Come here!
Come here!

53:00.640 --> 53:03.008
Hurry up!

53:03.009 --> 53:07.762
Open the safe. Open the safe.

53:07.763 --> 53:10.148
Hurry up. What are you,
retarded?

53:17.973 --> 53:20.292
Give me-- give me the bag.
Give me the bag.

53:23.730 --> 53:24.730
Keep it.

53:29.051 --> 53:31.753
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

53:31.754 --> 53:34.689
Bro, calm down.

53:34.690 --> 53:36.775
Calm down, all right?

53:36.776 --> 53:38.710
Everything is going to be okay.

53:38.711 --> 53:39.694
I'm not going to kill you.

53:39.695 --> 53:43.615
I don't know why I'm not.

53:43.616 --> 53:46.451
Is this your first time?

53:46.452 --> 53:49.955
Is this your
first time?

53:49.956 --> 53:52.090
What the fuck is wrong with you?

53:52.391 --> 53:54.076
What the fuck is wrong with you?

53:54.577 --> 53:56.378
Punch in the code!

53:59.449 --> 54:00.582
I got it! I got it!

54:00.583 --> 54:02.116
There you go.
There it is.

54:02.117 --> 54:03.922
Fill it up.
Yes, sir.

54:10.726 --> 54:12.260
You see? You see?

54:12.261 --> 54:14.095
It's money.

54:14.096 --> 54:17.132
It's about as
worthless as you are.

54:17.133 --> 54:18.166
Hurry up.

54:18.167 --> 54:19.707
I'm hurrying.
Hurry up.

54:19.969 --> 54:22.387
Please, just don't shoot.

54:24.573 --> 54:25.840
That's it. That's all of it.

54:25.841 --> 54:28.460
Give me the fucking bag.
Stay there.

54:28.461 --> 54:29.861
Thank you.
Pinhead.

54:54.002 --> 54:57.138
Your fucking money
doesn't mean anything,

54:57.139 --> 54:59.407
because all you use it for

54:59.408 --> 55:02.944
is stupid and senseless shit!

55:02.945 --> 55:05.781
What is he doing out there?

55:17.293 --> 55:18.626
Say goodbye!

55:24.367 --> 55:25.833
Lock the door!

55:25.834 --> 55:28.770
Have a nice day!

55:37.980 --> 55:39.981
Just stay inside.

56:19.588 --> 56:22.424
Once again, please stay indoors.

56:22.425 --> 56:25.093
Do not go outside
until local authorities

56:25.094 --> 56:27.095
have told you that
it's safe to.

56:44.196 --> 56:47.032
Sheriff Malvoy.

56:47.033 --> 56:49.568
The blaze is keeping all
available fire trucks

56:49.569 --> 56:51.836
and fire-fighters
extremely busy

56:51.837 --> 56:55.339
with no news on any survivors
in the collapsed building.

57:03.682 --> 57:07.486
...individual went amok in the
downtown shopping district,

57:07.487 --> 57:11.189
seemingly killing random people
without motive or reason.

57:11.190 --> 57:13.391
I don't know how this
could happen here,

57:13.392 --> 57:15.160
or anywhere, for that matter.

57:19.515 --> 57:21.816
Centerville? Centerville,
this is Sheriff Malvoy.

57:21.817 --> 57:23.818
Come back.

57:26.355 --> 57:28.140
Centerville,
this is Sheriff Malvoy.

57:28.141 --> 57:31.008
Clark and Bradley has been
robbed by an armed assailant.

57:31.009 --> 57:33.311
We're heading back into town on
Cross Road.

57:33.312 --> 57:35.080
30 minutes out. Over.

57:38.568 --> 57:40.352
What the hell is going on, Ray?

57:44.356 --> 57:46.091
Again, please be advised

57:46.092 --> 57:49.027
of the location of a suspected
armoured and armed terrorist.

57:50.496 --> 57:52.697
Therefore, we still
strongly recommend

57:52.698 --> 57:54.699
that everyone stays indoors.

57:58.737 --> 58:00.038
<i>Honey. Hi, sweetheart.
Are you okay?</i>

58:00.039 --> 58:01.406
Hey, Mom. Yeah, I'm okay.

58:01.407 --> 58:03.341
<i>Do you know what's
going on right now?</i>

58:03.342 --> 58:05.310
<i>You haven't--
you haven't seen anything?</i>

58:05.311 --> 58:06.544
What happened?

58:06.545 --> 58:07.879
<i>No, turn on the
television, Honey.</i>

58:07.880 --> 58:09.947
<i>There's, I guess,
one guy, they think,</i>

58:09.948 --> 58:11.449
<i>killing people all over town.</i>

58:11.450 --> 58:12.450
What do you mean?

58:12.451 --> 58:13.451
<i>Yes, yes! Killing people!</i>

58:13.452 --> 58:14.452
What do you mean
he killed people?

58:14.453 --> 58:15.720
<i>It's crazy, but you're fine.</i>

58:15.721 --> 58:17.188
<i>You're at home working
on your stuff, right?</i>

58:17.189 --> 58:18.856
I'm fine. I'm just--
I'm at home. Where are you?

58:18.857 --> 58:22.327
<i>I'm watching it on the news at work,
and it's terrible.</i>

58:22.328 --> 58:24.929
You're at work?
You're going to stay there?

58:24.930 --> 58:26.197
<i>No, I don't think so.</i>

58:26.198 --> 58:27.698
You're not going to come home?

58:27.699 --> 58:29.234
<i>No, not just yet, sweetheart.</i>

58:29.235 --> 58:30.968
<i>I'm going to go meet your dad,
and we're going to wait there.</i>

58:30.969 --> 58:32.537
Okay, when are you
going to be back?

58:32.538 --> 58:33.938
<i>Well, sweetheart, as soon
as we can get there, okay?</i>

58:33.939 --> 58:35.206
<i>Just please stay safe.</i>

58:35.207 --> 58:36.474
Okay, I'll be back--
I'll be here.

58:36.475 --> 58:38.243
<i>Sorry, honey,
you're breaking up.</i>

58:38.244 --> 58:40.378
I'll be back--
I mean, I'll be here.

58:40.379 --> 58:42.547
<i>Yes, stay there, okay?</i>

58:42.548 --> 58:44.616
<i>Sweetie, I love you.
Please be safe, okay?</i>

58:44.617 --> 58:46.017
Okay, stay safe.

58:46.018 --> 58:48.285
<i>All right, baby. I love you.
Bye-bye.</i>

59:29.311 --> 59:31.762
Fuck!

59:31.763 --> 59:33.281
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck, man!

59:35.050 --> 59:36.034
Evan.

59:36.035 --> 59:37.118
Billy.
Hey.

59:37.119 --> 59:38.036
<i>Yeah, where are you?</i>

59:38.037 --> 59:39.420
I'm running some
errands right now, man.

59:39.421 --> 59:40.121
<i>What errands?</i>

59:40.122 --> 59:42.703
I'm coming right now, Bro.
Don't go anywhere, okay?

59:42.743 --> 59:45.604
Don't go anywhere.
I'm getting in my car right now.

59:45.803 --> 59:47.144
Okay, bye.

01:00:06.949 --> 01:00:08.949
I'm going fucking nuts.

01:00:12.238 --> 01:00:14.605
Yeah, who's the winner, Bill?

01:00:14.606 --> 01:00:16.607
Who is the winner?
No, I'm not going to shoot you.

01:00:17.008 --> 01:00:18.576
I'm just fucking kidding.

01:00:18.577 --> 01:00:21.780
Seriously, though, seriously.

01:00:21.781 --> 01:00:23.782
Have you ever seen
a fucking cowboy?

01:01:32.351 --> 01:01:34.235
Fuck this kid.

01:01:34.236 --> 01:01:35.670
Fucking...

01:01:49.652 --> 01:01:50.652
<i>Hello!</i>

01:01:50.653 --> 01:01:53.387
Evan.

01:01:53.388 --> 01:01:55.389
I'm leaving.
I'm fucking leaving!

01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:57.024
No, you're not, man.

01:01:57.025 --> 01:01:58.192
Dude, you're taking
for fucking ever!

01:01:58.193 --> 01:02:00.060
I've had a lot of shit
to do today, okay?

01:02:00.061 --> 01:02:03.131
It's been a fucked up afternoon.
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

01:02:03.332 --> 01:02:04.132
<i>Don't go anywhere.</i>

01:02:04.133 --> 01:02:06.100
I've been wait--
Dude, I've been waiting.

01:02:06.101 --> 01:02:07.635
10 minutes, my fucking ass.

01:02:07.636 --> 01:02:09.704
I've been waiting here for
fucking 45 minutes.

01:02:09.705 --> 01:02:12.073
Paintball. Paintball.
Paintball, bro.

01:02:12.074 --> 01:02:12.990
So?

01:02:12.991 --> 01:02:15.909
<i>We're going to play paintball.</i>

01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:17.095
<i>Give me a fucking good reason--</i>

01:02:17.096 --> 01:02:19.764
and I want a fucking articulate
reason-- why I should stay.

01:02:19.865 --> 01:02:20.899
<i>Why should I stay?</i>

01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:24.218
I'm going to fucking
kill you, man.

01:02:24.219 --> 01:02:25.419
Listen, you're the one--
You're going to be needing

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:26.754
some fucking target practice,
all right?

01:02:27.055 --> 01:02:29.824
<i>You're not going to
go anywhere, right?</i>

01:02:30.325 --> 01:02:32.192
<i>Just stay there for
10 minutes, okay?</i>

01:02:32.193 --> 01:02:34.595
<i>I'm coming. I promise.
I love you, man.</i>

01:02:34.596 --> 01:02:35.930
<i>All right. I'll see you soon.</i>

01:02:35.931 --> 01:02:37.081
Okay.
Bye.

01:02:54.817 --> 01:02:58.019
We can go a little faster, Ray.

01:03:42.130 --> 01:03:43.631
Closer, Ray.

01:04:24.239 --> 01:04:25.790
Shit.

01:04:25.791 --> 01:04:27.191
Bump him.

01:06:26.478 --> 01:06:28.045
This is Sheriff Malvoy.

01:06:28.046 --> 01:06:29.614
I'm at the roundabout
in the County Park.

01:06:29.615 --> 01:06:31.215
I've got 2 more deputies down.

01:06:31.216 --> 01:06:33.384
I'm pursuing the suspect on foot.

01:07:42.053 --> 01:07:44.021
You got blood on me.

01:07:56.134 --> 01:07:58.135
60 to 80 seconds.

01:08:55.861 --> 01:08:56.861
You ready?

01:08:56.862 --> 01:08:58.529
What the fuck?

01:08:58.529 --> 01:09:00.229
Is that what you took
2 fucking hours doing?

01:09:00.231 --> 01:09:02.800
I'm glad you
didn't leave, buddy.

01:09:02.801 --> 01:09:04.801
I brought you a gift.

01:09:09.307 --> 01:09:10.774
What the fuck?

01:09:10.776 --> 01:09:11.776
Check it out.

01:09:11.777 --> 01:09:13.877
Dude!

01:09:13.879 --> 01:09:15.613
Dude, this is real money.

01:09:15.613 --> 01:09:18.415
It's a shit-load of money.

01:09:18.416 --> 01:09:22.019
Where the fuck did you get all
of this fucking money?

01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:23.287
Hey, Evan?

01:09:23.287 --> 01:09:24.856
Yeah?

01:09:24.857 --> 01:09:26.023
Check it out.

01:09:29.426 --> 01:09:32.328
You all right?

01:09:32.330 --> 01:09:34.765
Give me your hand.

01:09:34.765 --> 01:09:38.669
Hold this. Hold this.

01:09:38.670 --> 01:09:41.772
You kind of asked
for it, right?

01:09:41.773 --> 01:09:44.174
I kind of made you the martyr
you always wanted to be.

01:12:05.433 --> 01:12:08.201
You are a prodigy of the world,
my son, a prodigy of the world.

01:12:08.202 --> 01:12:10.554
We'd like you to...

01:12:10.555 --> 01:12:13.340
Stop having these things
sent to my fucking house.

01:12:13.341 --> 01:12:15.175
Last ones, man.

01:12:15.176 --> 01:12:16.810
You're making me pay
for my own post education.

01:12:16.811 --> 01:12:18.929
I've been waiting
for fucking 45 minutes.

01:12:18.930 --> 01:12:21.681
I made you the martyr
you always wanted to be.

01:12:21.682 --> 01:12:24.735
Okay, sweetie.
I love you. Be safe.

01:12:24.736 --> 01:12:29.139
You're going to pay for this!
Do you hear me?

01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:31.742
What do you think I want?
Come on, quick.

01:12:31.743 --> 01:12:34.345
Money! Money! Money!

01:12:34.346 --> 01:12:36.864
I don't know.
My name is Evan Drince.

01:12:36.865 --> 01:12:38.782
Do you have any thoughts?

01:12:38.783 --> 01:12:40.784
Your fucking money
doesn't mean anything!

01:13:15.854 --> 01:13:18.889
...dozens of Centerville
residents and police officers

01:13:18.890 --> 01:13:21.925
earlier today, during what can
only be described

01:13:21.926 --> 01:13:24.278
as a massacre.

01:13:24.279 --> 01:13:26.847
The rampage began with
a massive explosion

01:13:26.848 --> 01:13:28.132
that destroyed Centerville
police station.

01:13:28.133 --> 01:13:31.501
God, honey.
There you are, sweetheart.

01:13:31.502 --> 01:13:32.752
This is just so awful.

01:13:32.753 --> 01:13:35.989
I'm so glad you're here.

01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:38.359
You're okay, though, yeah?

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:42.028
I'm so glad you
weren't out in this. This was--

01:13:42.029 --> 01:13:43.364
Are you okay, Bill?

01:13:43.365 --> 01:13:44.598
You were back here
when this started?

01:13:44.599 --> 01:13:46.667
I drove by the bakery,

01:13:46.668 --> 01:13:48.369
and the whole glass was
shattered out of the bakery.

01:13:48.370 --> 01:13:49.536
This is the forest.

01:13:49.537 --> 01:13:52.906
Look, this is where
they found the guy.

01:13:52.907 --> 01:13:53.907
They found the shooter already?

01:13:53.908 --> 01:13:54.941
Yeah.

01:13:54.942 --> 01:13:55.942
Wait a second.
One guy did all of this?

01:13:55.943 --> 01:13:57.511
It was Evan.

01:13:57.512 --> 01:14:00.447
Evan got shot?
Did Evan get shot?

01:14:00.448 --> 01:14:04.034
No, Mom. Evan did it.
My friend, Evan.

01:14:04.035 --> 01:14:05.469
My God.

01:14:05.470 --> 01:14:07.304
Shot all of the--?

01:14:07.305 --> 01:14:09.940
Have they announced his name or
you just recognized him?

01:14:09.941 --> 01:14:12.008
They just said it,
Evan Drince, Evan Drince.

01:14:12.009 --> 01:14:14.578
Breaking news.
Unbelievable.

01:14:14.579 --> 01:14:17.380
How did they find him? Like,
what? Did he give himself up?

01:14:17.381 --> 01:14:18.882
They just found
him in the woods.

01:14:18.883 --> 01:14:20.417
He shot himself in the head.

01:14:20.418 --> 01:14:21.618
He's dead?

01:14:21.619 --> 01:14:24.387
He committed suicide.
He committed suicide.

01:14:24.388 --> 01:14:26.056
This is insane.

01:14:26.057 --> 01:14:27.458
This world is a crazy place,
isn't it?

01:14:27.459 --> 01:14:29.159
He was a fucked up kid.

01:14:31.012 --> 01:14:32.880
I thought he was--
I thought he was a bit odd,

01:14:32.881 --> 01:14:34.547
but I didn't think
he was a--

01:14:34.548 --> 01:14:36.466
Psychopath?

01:14:36.467 --> 01:14:38.535
He looked like he had secrets.

01:14:38.536 --> 01:14:40.537
I mean, I'm just
an armchair psychologist,

01:14:40.538 --> 01:14:42.907
but a mother knows.

01:14:42.908 --> 01:14:45.042
Like, you just intuit.

01:14:45.043 --> 01:14:46.410
Yeah.

01:14:46.411 --> 01:14:49.363
Nevertheless, it must be a shock
for his parents.

01:14:49.364 --> 01:14:50.964
Have you spoken to them?

01:14:51.565 --> 01:14:52.532
Yeah.

01:14:52.533 --> 01:14:53.767
I don't even want to ask you

01:14:53.768 --> 01:14:55.235
about the college
applications now.

01:14:55.236 --> 01:14:59.923
It all seems
so trite, I guess.

01:14:59.924 --> 01:15:01.591
I'm glad you guys
are okay, right?

01:15:01.592 --> 01:15:04.092
Yeah.
We're fine.

01:15:05.730 --> 01:15:07.280
Presently, the only
thing we know...

01:15:07.281 --> 01:15:09.182
This is where I drove by.

01:15:09.183 --> 01:15:10.451
I told you I saw
that poor woman.

01:15:10.452 --> 01:15:13.153
Do you think
it's Mrs. Blakeslee?

01:15:13.154 --> 01:15:15.989
I didn't want to stay around
long enough to find out?

01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:17.791
Guys, I'm so tired.
I'm going to go to sleep.

01:15:17.792 --> 01:15:20.261
Of course, honey.

01:15:20.262 --> 01:15:21.662
I'm really sorry
about your friend.

01:15:21.663 --> 01:15:23.130
I'm really sorry.

01:15:27.902 --> 01:15:29.570
You give us a shout if
you need anything, okay?

01:15:29.571 --> 01:15:31.371
All right.
Take care, guys.

01:15:31.372 --> 01:15:32.806
Get some sleep.

01:15:32.807 --> 01:15:34.408
Yeah, sweetheart. Bye-bye.

01:15:34.409 --> 01:15:36.810
I think he's
holding it in.

01:15:36.811 --> 01:15:38.912
Maybe we should take
him to see somebody.

01:15:38.913 --> 01:15:40.581
Well, for sure after this.

01:15:40.582 --> 01:15:42.082
He's going to have
to go talk to someone.

01:15:42.083 --> 01:15:44.118
Yeah.

01:15:44.119 --> 01:15:46.920
Just, I don't want anyone to
know that we're taking him.

01:15:46.921 --> 01:15:48.388
Yeah, fair enough.

01:15:48.389 --> 01:15:50.190
I don't want people to know and
think he's crazy or something.

01:15:50.191 --> 01:15:52.859
My God.
This is awful.

01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:54.628
Let's have a drink or something?

01:15:54.629 --> 01:15:57.598
Yeah, make me a
double, something.

01:15:57.599 --> 01:16:00.817
Stay tuned to this station
for an update of this tragic story

01:16:00.818 --> 01:16:02.953
as more details
become available.

01:16:24.809 --> 01:16:27.377
Centerville resident
Lloyd Drince,

01:16:27.378 --> 01:16:30.898
the father of Evan Drince
was arrested at his home

01:16:30.899 --> 01:16:32.750
when local authorities

01:16:32.751 --> 01:16:35.018
attempted to enter the
premises.

01:16:35.019 --> 01:16:38.355
Close sources reveal that Lloyd
Drince used to be a radical

01:16:38.356 --> 01:16:43.326
and extreme protester
in the '60s and '70s,

01:16:43.327 --> 01:16:46.029
especially at the height
of the war in Vietnam

01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:48.665
and has always been
strongly outspoken

01:16:48.666 --> 01:16:50.734
against the government.

01:16:50.735 --> 01:16:53.971
With the current evidence that
his son, Evan Drince,

01:16:53.972 --> 01:16:56.907
has been identified as being
behind the massacre

01:16:56.908 --> 01:16:59.276
in downtown Centerville today,

01:16:59.277 --> 01:17:01.611
it appears that
radical measures

01:17:01.612 --> 01:17:05.315
to get your opinions
out runs in the family.

01:17:05.316 --> 01:17:08.051
To recap, the offender
has been identified

01:17:08.052 --> 01:17:12.589
as 21-year-old Centerville
resident Evan Drince,

01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:15.726
who took his own life
in a nearby forested area

01:17:15.727 --> 01:17:17.729
after completing his
destruction and killing spree.

01:17:17.830 --> 01:17:20.664
You've got the wrong kid!
My kid wouldn't do this!

01:17:20.665 --> 01:17:22.432
My kid's innocent!

01:17:22.433 --> 01:17:24.134
Bill Williamson!

01:17:24.135 --> 01:17:28.071
Bill Williamson did this!

01:17:28.072 --> 01:17:30.440
Check Bill Williamson's house!

01:17:30.441 --> 01:17:34.544
My kid is not a murderer!

01:17:34.545 --> 01:17:37.981
My son is innocent!
Bill Williamson!

01:17:37.982 --> 01:17:40.434
The authorities have not
pressed any charges

01:17:40.435 --> 01:17:44.137
or revealed information
about suspects

01:17:44.138 --> 01:17:46.807
since they feel a thorough
investigation is needed...

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:53.600
Subtitles: Arigon

01:17:55.733 --> 01:17:57.733
It's a...

01:18:00.404 --> 01:18:02.639
It's a downward spiral

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:06.576
to the end of all times.

01:18:06.577 --> 01:18:10.813
And there's no chance
that we can survive.

01:18:10.814 --> 01:18:15.102
I mean...
70 million people every year

01:18:15.285 --> 01:18:17.054
are brought onto this Earth.

01:18:17.055 --> 01:18:19.888
What are they doing?
Sucking up our resources.

01:18:20.157 --> 01:18:23.060
There's too many people,
so what do we do?

01:18:23.461 --> 01:18:25.295
Just keep them around?

01:18:25.296 --> 01:18:26.897
Let's kill them.

01:18:26.898 --> 01:18:29.166
Let's get rid of them.

01:18:29.167 --> 01:18:30.634
Good, thank you.

01:18:30.635 --> 01:18:32.903
Thanks for--
thanks for coming out.

01:18:32.904 --> 01:18:34.405
But you know what?

01:18:34.406 --> 01:18:36.473
We're at capacity.

01:18:36.474 --> 01:18:37.607
We're at capacity now.

01:18:37.608 --> 01:18:41.011
So... sorry, no more.

01:18:41.012 --> 01:18:42.546
No more.

01:18:42.547 --> 01:18:44.898
So that's what I'll do.

01:18:44.899 --> 01:18:46.867
Why not?

01:18:46.868 --> 01:18:48.469
That's my plan.

01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:50.003
That's what I want to do.

01:18:50.004 --> 01:18:53.006
Let's just clean the world,

01:18:53.007 --> 01:18:56.477
so maybe the rest of us can
sustain a little bit of life.

01:18:59.130 --> 01:19:02.900
So maybe that's what
I'll do in the future.

01:19:02.901 --> 01:19:05.702
I'll help you out.

01:19:05.703 --> 01:19:07.304
I'll help you out,

01:19:07.305 --> 01:19:09.914
and I will cleanse,

01:19:11.075 --> 01:19:14.144
make more room for you.

01:19:14.145 --> 01:19:19.015
I will exhibit my own brand of
population control...

01:19:19.016 --> 01:19:21.017
for you.

01:19:23.954 --> 01:19:25.955
That's it.
