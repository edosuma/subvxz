got muscles like ham hocks
on their arms.

29:39.195 --> 29:42.321
I'm definitely
probably the weaker one
out of the four of us.

29:44.158 --> 29:46.867
- Whoa.
- Oh, a little too high.

29:46.911 --> 29:50.829
We went pretty late trying
to really get it down,

29:50.873 --> 29:54.291
<i> but we have never successfully</i>
<i> done the lift.</i>

29:54.335 --> 29:57.795
What if we don't hit it
when we're on the dance floor?

29:57.838 --> 30:00.506
<i> I really hope</i>
<i> that I don't fall.</i>

30:01.675 --> 30:03.926
Um, I feel like I needed
a little more lift.

30:03.969 --> 30:05.928
Even more up? Okay.

30:05.930 --> 30:08.388
'cause I feel like
I'm right up in your belly.

30:08.390 --> 30:12.184
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- But you want me
to go higher? Okay.

30:12.228 --> 30:15.145
- It's "dirty dancing," bruh.
- Yeah.

30:35.251 --> 30:39.753
Baby is so cute,
but she's also powerful.

30:42.091 --> 30:43.799
She's the girl next door.

30:43.843 --> 30:47.010
I'm kinda that
girl next door as well.

30:47.012 --> 30:49.054
She's that ultimate good girl.

30:50.307 --> 30:53.433
She for some reason
grabbed your attention...

30:55.020 --> 30:56.436
...And I loved that about her.

31:00.150 --> 31:03.193
- Hm!
- Inhale.

31:05.990 --> 31:08.198
- Boom, ah!
- That felt good!

31:08.242 --> 31:09.408
That felt better.
Yeah, that did feel good.

31:09.451 --> 31:10.742
We got it.

31:10.786 --> 31:12.661
- Yes, tyler boo-boo!
- You know? So we got it.

31:12.663 --> 31:14.997
- Okay, let's go
get something to eat.
- You wanna go eat?

31:15.040 --> 31:17.499
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm down. Let's go eat.

31:27.261 --> 31:30.345
- What's up, everybody?
- What's up?

31:30.347 --> 31:33.140
- Y'all clean up nice.
- Thank you!

31:33.183 --> 31:34.349
You too, sweetie.

31:34.351 --> 31:36.351
- Thank you very much.
Thank you.
- Yes!

31:36.353 --> 31:40.856
Now, y'all,
earlier on, you improvised
on this dance floor,

31:40.858 --> 31:42.774
but now you have routines
to perform.

31:42.818 --> 31:45.819
We're looking for that fun.
We're looking for that sexiness.

31:45.863 --> 31:47.654
We're looking
for that connection.

31:47.656 --> 31:51.909
<i> Now you're dancing as a couple</i>
<i> but competing individually.</i>

31:51.952 --> 31:55.829
Stakes are high.
Very high.

31:55.831 --> 31:57.956
The winning baby
and the winning johnny

31:58.000 --> 31:59.541
will get to pick their partner

31:59.585 --> 32:01.168
for the remainder
of this competition.

32:01.211 --> 32:03.921
- Right.
- Ow, ow!

32:03.964 --> 32:06.924
Now you might be
asking yourself,

32:06.967 --> 32:09.843
how are we gonna
decide the winners?

32:09.887 --> 32:10.969
It's actually in your hands.

32:11.013 --> 32:12.763
Oh, wow.

32:12.806 --> 32:14.598
After every couple has danced,

32:14.683 --> 32:18.685
ladies, you'll decide
who's the best johnny,

32:18.729 --> 32:22.022
and, fellas, you'll decide
who's the best baby.

32:22.066 --> 32:25.067
I wanna win this
because I like the feeling.

32:25.110 --> 32:28.070
Okay, ready
to set this thing off,

32:28.113 --> 32:30.155
give it up corbin and cat,
come on.

32:30.199 --> 32:32.908
- Come on, corbin!
- Yay!

32:32.910 --> 32:36.995
This my first dance
in front of anybody.

32:37.039 --> 32:40.207
<i> I've been waiting breathlessly</i>
<i> for this moment.</i>

32:40.250 --> 32:42.459
- Oh.
- Ooh, okay.

32:46.799 --> 32:50.509
<i> ♪ big girls don't cry </i>

I love it.

33:43.981 --> 33:46.857
Anjelah:
<i> Corbin is a fantastic dancer.</i>

33:46.900 --> 33:49.693
He's just so good.

33:49.737 --> 33:53.530
Cat, she really brought
the essence of what baby was.

33:54.867 --> 33:56.283
Twitch: So how did that feel?

33:56.326 --> 34:00.412
I have never danced.
I'm 54 years old, have six kids,

34:00.414 --> 34:04.166
and to be sexy and to bring this
in a different light,

34:04.209 --> 34:07.252
it's just, it's really--
as a mother...

34:07.254 --> 34:09.588
- Absolutely. Yes, yes.
- Sorry. I'm getting
so emotional.

34:09.631 --> 34:15.177
- That's what dance does.
It brings out emotion.
- 100%. 100%, yes. Exactly.

34:15.220 --> 34:16.553
Give it up for them
one more time.

34:16.597 --> 34:17.888
Give it up. Give it up.

34:17.931 --> 34:21.016
All right, next up,
loni and tyler.

34:21.060 --> 34:25.062
I haven't danced since 1996,
so this is gonna be hilarious.

34:25.105 --> 34:28.982
- I was born in '93.
- So that tell you
what you about to see.

34:28.984 --> 34:31.935
Let's get it!
Come on out here, let's go!

34:31.937 --> 34:33.403
- You ready?
- Let's-- I'm ready.

34:34.573 --> 34:36.022
Let's go!

34:36.033 --> 34:38.825
I know my mom would've loved
to have seen this.

34:38.869 --> 34:41.870
<i> She always pushed me to do</i>
<i> better and bigger things.</i>

34:41.914 --> 34:43.955

35:38.011 --> 35:40.220
- Yeah!
- Amazing.

35:40.264 --> 35:44.933
( overlapping shouting )

35:44.977 --> 35:46.393
oh, my god.

35:47.354 --> 35:48.854
- Whoa!
- Yeah!

35:48.897 --> 35:51.356
Tyler:
<i> I'm stoked. We hit everything</i>
<i> we needed to hit,</i>

35:51.400 --> 35:52.691
<i> and we ended with a bang.</i>

35:52.734 --> 35:54.067
<i> My mom would've</i>
<i> definitely been proud.</i>

35:54.111 --> 35:56.111
She'll be watching over.
She'll be excited for me.

35:56.155 --> 35:57.654
Good job.
So proud of y'all.

35:57.698 --> 36:00.073
- That was amazing.
How did that feel?
- Yes!

36:00.075 --> 36:01.825
I felt at home with baby
right here, you know?

36:01.827 --> 36:03.827
- This was home.
- I love it. I love it.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.287
Tyler did a really good job

36:05.330 --> 36:09.374
<i> playing up</i>
<i> that patrick swayze</i>
<i> johnny swagger.</i>

36:09.376 --> 36:14.462
Tyler shows us all up
and shows us how strong
the competition is.

36:16.008 --> 36:19.009
Watching everybody else,
I had to take my pulse.

36:19.052 --> 36:20.177
At one point I was like,
"oh, my god.

36:20.220 --> 36:21.970
My heart's gonna beat
out of my chest."

36:21.972 --> 36:25.557
the next couple
is anjelah and howie.

36:25.559 --> 36:27.934
Let's do it. Let's do it.

36:27.978 --> 36:29.102
- Okay.
- Let's go!

36:29.146 --> 36:31.062
Howie:
<i> The nerves kicked in.</i>

36:31.106 --> 36:33.899
I felt like I was out
of my element.

36:33.942 --> 36:36.193
I was out of my comfort zone.

36:36.236 --> 36:41.448
I was probably more nervous
than my first concert
with the backstreet boys.

36:52.085 --> 36:54.753
Just keep my shoulders down,
my head up,

36:54.796 --> 36:58.215
my frame locked,
stay on my toes.

36:58.258 --> 36:59.966
What if I forget the steps?

37:00.010 --> 37:03.303
The next couple to set it off
on this floor...

37:05.015 --> 37:07.057
- Anjelah and howie.
- Wow.

37:07.100 --> 37:10.060
- Come on.
- Let's do it.

37:10.103 --> 37:13.188
Anjelah:
<i> We have never successfully</i>
<i> pulled off the lift.</i>

37:13.232 --> 37:16.399
I wanted to just get it,
like, out of my body.

37:23.200 --> 37:24.824

- Whoo!

38:11.039 --> 38:14.332
( muttering )

38:14.376 --> 38:16.751
howie:
<i> The lift didn't come off</i>
<i> as we planned it.</i>

38:16.795 --> 38:20.964
I will admit
that I didn't get her
right up to the top there.

38:24.011 --> 38:25.552
Anjelah:
<i> We were, like, doing great,</i>

38:25.554 --> 38:27.929
but then forget it.

38:27.973 --> 38:28.972
Then it was game over.

38:29.016 --> 38:30.932
How are you feeling?

38:30.934 --> 38:32.309
That was just a dry run.
Let's do it again.

38:32.352 --> 38:34.102
- Exactly. Exactly.
- I knew my strength

38:34.146 --> 38:35.186
wouldn't get her through
the ceiling, so...

38:35.397 --> 38:38.565
Loni:<i> I mean,</i>
<i> they made a few mistakes,</i>

38:38.608 --> 38:42.027
but they were hot together.

38:42.070 --> 38:45.572
Last to set it off,
antonio and brie.

38:45.615 --> 38:48.158
- Whoo!
- Let's go!

38:49.286 --> 38:51.619
I have never had to be,
like, really sexy.

38:51.663 --> 38:54.998
<i> And seeing the other women</i>
<i> really feeling it,</i>

38:55.000 --> 38:57.292

- Wow.
- Yeah!

39:51.223 --> 39:54.224
We all here for you, baby.
We all here for you.

39:54.267 --> 39:56.476
Brie, you are no longer
a wrestler.

39:56.520 --> 39:59.604
You are a dancer.

39:59.606 --> 40:03.566
What's something
that you love that you did
in that performance?

40:03.610 --> 40:05.110
Antonio:
Uh, we finished.

40:06.863 --> 40:09.322
Brie:
<i> You know, I had to do</i>
<i> some sexy stuff,</i>

40:09.366 --> 40:12.325
and I feel like
I pulled it off.

40:12.327 --> 40:15.787
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
this is what we're about to do.

40:15.872 --> 40:17.789
Ladies,
you're gonna get together

40:17.833 --> 40:21.292
- and decide who is
tonight's best johnny.
- Okay.

40:21.336 --> 40:25.255
And, fellas,
you'll get together and decide
tonight's best baby.

40:28.885 --> 40:31.219
Very, very important decision
y'all are making right now.

40:31.221 --> 40:33.138
- How you doing?
- Good, good, good.

40:33.181 --> 40:34.889
- It's gonna be
a tough one to make.
- Sure.

40:34.891 --> 40:36.850
I think cat fits baby.

40:36.893 --> 40:39.853
<i> Like, she was still learning</i>
<i> and getting through it,</i>

40:39.896 --> 40:43.231
<i> but yet</i>
<i> she was growing so fast.</i>

40:43.275 --> 40:45.233
<i> That's what it looks like</i>
<i> in the movie.</i>

40:45.235 --> 40:47.277
And she, like, brought it.
Was like a blossoming flower.

40:47.279 --> 40:48.903
She's totally coming out.

40:48.947 --> 40:51.865
Anjelah, she's the best dancer
I think right now,
without a doubt.

40:51.950 --> 40:54.576
- Absolutely.
- It felt like I was watching

40:54.619 --> 40:58.246
two people just, like,
from a corner in a club
just doing their thing.

40:58.290 --> 41:00.248
She's an amazing partner,
honestly.

41:00.292 --> 41:02.083
Tyler:
<i> So what about brie?</i>

41:02.127 --> 41:04.127
<i> Her acrobatics</i>
<i> from wwe came through.</i>

41:04.171 --> 41:08.131
She seemed the most timid
before it started

41:08.175 --> 41:10.383
<i> and then she just came alive.</i>

41:10.427 --> 41:12.260
- Tyler:<i> Blossomed. </i>
-<i> Yeah.</i>

41:12.304 --> 41:13.845
But if we're talking
about that baby mold,

41:13.889 --> 41:17.891
loni has confidence
and swagger to her.

41:17.893 --> 41:22.312
She's fun, and she's like,
"I'm about to give it to you.

41:22.355 --> 41:24.564
- All right, ladies.
- All right, we gotta
make a decision.

41:24.608 --> 41:26.566
- This is tough.
- This is really tough.
I'm torn.

41:26.610 --> 41:28.568
This is beyond tough.

41:28.570 --> 41:31.070
You know,
looking at each of the men,

41:31.114 --> 41:35.325
<i> if I could put them</i>
<i> all together, that would be</i>
<i> the perfect johnny.</i>

41:35.368 --> 41:38.036
<i> Corbin definitely</i>
<i> has the same butt as johnny.</i>

41:38.079 --> 41:40.830
- I was staring at that
butt the whole time.
- Yeah, he's got that--

41:40.874 --> 41:43.333
<i> but then I'm, like,</i>
<i> is the swag missing?</i>

41:43.376 --> 41:46.294
-<i> Like, that johnny swag? </i>
- Anjelah:<i> Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

41:46.338 --> 41:49.422
I thought antonio did
such a good job leading you,

41:49.466 --> 41:52.425
<i> and for neither one of you</i>
<i> having a dance background,</i>

41:52.469 --> 41:55.178
<i> I thought he led you so well.</i>

41:55.263 --> 41:57.305
Howie's movements,
he has great moves.

41:57.349 --> 42:00.475
<i> I mean, he has a swagger</i>
<i> and this passion that is--</i>

42:00.519 --> 42:01.935
<i> like, it's hot.</i>

42:01.937 --> 42:03.770
Like, it's very palpable.

42:03.813 --> 42:05.271
Loni:
<i> Tyler made me look good.</i>

42:05.398 --> 42:08.024
-<i> I felt the passion</i>
<i> coming from him. </i>
-<i> I did too.</i>

42:08.068 --> 42:13.530
I came into this thinking
I knew who I was going to pick.
Now I'm torn.

42:13.573 --> 42:15.448
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

42:26.211 --> 42:28.419
So now it's time to find out.

42:28.463 --> 42:33.758
Fellas, in your opinion,
who was the best baby tonight?

42:33.760 --> 42:38.096
Well, ladies,
you guys all brought your
unique character to baby

42:38.139 --> 42:40.139
and we fell in love
with all of you guys.

42:40.183 --> 42:42.809
- Aww.
- But we had to pick
one tonight,

42:42.852 --> 42:45.186
and so we feel
the best baby...

42:49.484 --> 42:51.442
- ...Is cat.
- Oh.

42:51.486 --> 42:53.278
( cheering )

42:53.321 --> 42:56.364
twitch: Nice!
Cat, come on up here.

42:58.076 --> 43:02.161
Cat really did show the essence
of what baby was.

43:02.205 --> 43:04.247
She was, like,
looking into his eyes

43:04.249 --> 43:05.915
<i> and going with the flow.</i>

43:05.959 --> 43:07.041
<i> She had fun,</i>
<i> and she was free,</i>

43:07.085 --> 43:08.960
<i> and she was sexy</i>
<i> at the same time.</i>

43:08.962 --> 43:10.169
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

43:10.213 --> 43:13.423
- Absolutely.
- She just fit baby the best.

43:13.466 --> 43:14.924
How you feel?

43:14.968 --> 43:17.677
I just feel, again,
so grateful to corbin

43:17.721 --> 43:20.847
because he taught me so much,
and I feel beyond grateful.

43:20.890 --> 43:23.391
Well, we're so proud of you.
Let's give it up one more time
for her. Absolutely.

43:23.393 --> 43:27.186
- Cat! Yeah!
- All right, ladies,

43:27.230 --> 43:29.022
the next moment of truth.

43:29.024 --> 43:31.983
In your opinion tonight,

43:31.985 --> 43:34.110
who was the best johnny?

43:34.112 --> 43:36.904
We were all torn,

43:36.948 --> 43:40.491
but tonight
the best johnny was...

43:44.372 --> 43:47.957
- Tyler.
- 'ey!

43:49.294 --> 43:52.170
Wow. Wow.

43:52.213 --> 43:54.380
Anjelah:
<i> Tyler blew me away.</i>

43:54.424 --> 43:58.760
He was so charismatic,
so fun.

43:58.762 --> 44:03.765
I am a competitor,
and I like actually
having competition.

44:05.310 --> 44:06.142
It's on.

44:06.186 --> 44:07.935
Tyler, how you feeling, man?

44:07.937 --> 44:10.313
Aw, man,
it's stiff competition,

44:10.357 --> 44:11.397
and I look up to
all of you guys,

44:11.733 --> 44:14.984
so I feel honored to be here
and to be next to you.

44:14.986 --> 44:16.778
- I mean, you're incredible.
- Thank you.

44:16.780 --> 44:19.989
- You're a real superwoman.
- And you're a gentleman too.

44:19.991 --> 44:21.574
Twitch: So y'all listen,
congratulations.

44:21.618 --> 44:23.618
- Hot performances tonight.
- Hot, hot.

44:23.662 --> 44:26.913
As you can see,
I'm still sweating.
Still sweating.

44:28.667 --> 44:31.834
What I need you to do now
is go on back to your cabin,
get some rest,

44:31.878 --> 44:34.295
because everything
could change tomorrow.

44:34.381 --> 44:36.339
- All right.
- Congratulations, y'all.

44:40.220 --> 44:43.805
