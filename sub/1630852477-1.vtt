10:09.680 --> 10:13.240
- The first stage in the
realisation of a piece of music

10:13.280 --> 10:15.240
is to construct the
individual sounds

10:15.280 --> 10:17.720
that we're going to use.

10:17.760 --> 10:19.720
To do this,
we go to these

10:19.760 --> 10:22.200
sound generators here,
electronic generators,

10:22.240 --> 10:25.480
and we listen to three of the
basic electronic sounds.

10:25.520 --> 10:27.320
First, is the simplest
sound of all,

10:27.360 --> 10:28.720
which is a sine wave.

10:28.760 --> 10:30.200
[Stagnant tone]

10:30.240 --> 10:31.200
You can see on
the oscilloscope,

10:31.240 --> 10:35.880
it has a very simple form and
has a very pure sound.

10:35.920 --> 10:38.160
Now listen to the same note
but with a different quality.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.440
This is a square wave.

10:40.480 --> 10:41.600
[Piercing stagnant tone]

10:41.640 --> 10:43.200
It's very square
on the picture

10:43.240 --> 10:44.840
and perhaps rather
harsh to listen to.

10:44.960 --> 10:46.800
This is because it has a lot
of high harmonics

10:46.840 --> 10:50.840
and that's what gives the
corners on the picture.

10:50.880 --> 10:55.160
Now a more complex
sound still is white noise.

10:55.200 --> 10:58.280
[Staticky, rain-like sound

10:58.320 --> 11:00.960
We don't always go to

11:01.000 --> 11:02.960
for our basic
sources of sound.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.760
If the sound we want exists
already in real life, say,

11:06.800 --> 11:08.320
we can go and record it.

state like this.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.280
To make them of value
for a musical piece,

11:19.320 --> 11:22.760
we have to shape them
and mold them.

11:22.800 --> 11:24.400
We can get the lower sounds
we need from the rhythm

11:24.440 --> 11:26.760
by slowing down the tape.

[Pops get progressively
higher in pitch]

to do is cut the notes

11:40.880 --> 11:44.080
[Low pops become
rhythmic bass tones]

11:44.120 --> 11:47.960

notes of the rhythm, again,

we join them
together in a loop

14:45.480 --> 14:48.400
Freedom was more
than a feeling.

- [Man]: There isn't
much glamour

14:53.840 --> 14:55.600
about this

14:55.640 --> 14:57.560
Women at work are
getting to look and behave

14:57.600 --> 14:59.800
more like men.

14:59.840 --> 15:03.120
It's not very attractive.

15:05.360 --> 15:09.160
[Haunting squeaking sounds]

15:09.200 --> 15:12.280
- Welcome to Tower Folly,
this lonely host house

15:12.320 --> 15:15.280
on the North Downs of Kent.

15:15.320 --> 15:16.280
Well, as far
as I know

15:16.320 --> 15:18.000
this house isn't haunted
and there isn't

15:18.040 --> 15:20.240
a mad scientist in sight.

15:20.280 --> 15:23.240
This is in fact a music factory
where they can literally

15:23.280 --> 15:26.160
make music out of
electronic sounds,

15:26.200 --> 15:29.320
and the woman who makes it
has just been awarded a grant

15:29.360 --> 15:32.560
by the Gulbenkian Foundation
to help her research.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.520
She's here at
her control box,

15:34.560 --> 15:37.200
Miss Daphne Oram.

15:37.560 --> 15:40.040
How did you get involved
in this kind of work?

15:40.080 --> 15:42.960
- It dates back really
to 1944, I think,

15:43.000 --> 15:43.800
when I read a book

15:43.840 --> 15:46.600
which prophesied that
composers in the future

15:46.640 --> 15:48.560
would compose directly
into sound instead of

15:48.600 --> 15:50.960
using orchestral
instruments, you see.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.560
And well, since then
I've been working

15:53.600 --> 15:55.280
in BBC Studios,

15:55.320 --> 15:56.720
and so I've got
some little grasp

15:56.760 --> 15:58.720
of this sort of
equipment.

15:58.760 --> 16:01.560
[Upbeat orchestral
music starts]

16:01.600 --> 16:03.160
I was trained as a musician,

16:03.200 --> 16:06.760
and the two sort of
click together, you see.

16:08.840 --> 16:10.800
- Daphne was a
very gifted pianist

16:10.840 --> 16:13.200
and she had secured
a place for herself

16:13.240 --> 16:16.520
at the Royal Academy of Music,
which she turned down

16:16.560 --> 16:19.240
because she was also very
interested in technology

16:19.280 --> 16:22.280
and wanted to
work at the BBC.

16:22.320 --> 16:26.240
[Haunting electronic sounds]

16:26.280 --> 16:28.480
I was asked to do some
incidental music

16:28.520 --> 16:30.560
for a television play,

16:30.600 --> 16:34.280
and I did this by
getting together,

16:34.320 --> 16:35.720
in the middle of the night,

16:35.760 --> 16:39.240
all the tape recorders that
I could find in studios,

16:39.280 --> 16:41.280
collecting them together
in one studio,

16:41.320 --> 16:45.560
and working until they had to
be put back the next morning,

16:45.600 --> 16:47.240
sleeping a little bit and
then coming back in

16:47.280 --> 16:50.240
to do my normal
chamber music work.

16:50.280 --> 16:54.960
[Upbeat flute and piano

16:55.000 --> 16:57.520
Then it grew from that.

16:57.560 --> 17:01.160
I was asked to help start
the radiophonic workshop.

17:01.200 --> 17:04.520
- [Man Whispering]:
Listen.

17:04.560 --> 17:05.520
- Without Daphne,

17:05.560 --> 17:08.320
it would never have started
because BBC did not want

17:08.360 --> 17:10.280
an electronic music studio.

17:11.880 --> 17:14.800
We were just using anything
we could grab hold of.

17:14.840 --> 17:17.200
We had basic
laboratory equipment

17:17.240 --> 17:20.440
and a pair of tape machines
that had been liberated

17:20.480 --> 17:22.800
at the end of the war.

17:22.840 --> 17:25.200
[Banging and oscillating
electronic sounds]

17:25.240 --> 17:27.320
- Playwrights were
writing in a surreal

17:27.360 --> 17:28.800
kind of style,

17:28.840 --> 17:31.280
which was a
legacy of the war.

17:31.320 --> 17:34.800
The style required a
different kind of sound.

17:34.840 --> 17:37.800
- [echoing, haunting male voice]:
Bird or angel?

17:37.880 --> 17:39.840
- [Male Radio Announcer]: This

17:39.880 --> 17:41.200
We think it's
worth broadcasting

17:41.240 --> 17:43.080
as a perfectly serious
first attempt

17:43.120 --> 17:46.160
to find out whether
we can convey a new kind of

17:46.200 --> 17:49.000
emotional and
intellectual experience

17:49.040 --> 17:52.520
by means of what we call

- [Male Radio Announcer]: It's
a sort of modern magic.

18:10.840 --> 18:14.520
Some musicians believe that
it can become an art form

18:14.560 --> 18:16.240
complete in itself.

18:16.280 --> 18:17.920
Others are skeptical.

18:17.960 --> 18:19.280
In fact, we've decided
not to use

18:19.320 --> 18:21.280
the word "music" at all.

18:30.280 --> 18:36.520
to the Brussels World Fair
became a fateful pilgrimage.

18:36.640 --> 18:40.160
There, Daphne hears

with synchronised
projections.

18:44.840 --> 18:47.760
[Low rumbling]

18:50.080 --> 18:54.240
Electronic music was more
than just incidental.

18:54.280 --> 18:58.480
It was the sound
of the future.

19:02.360 --> 19:04.800
- [Daphne Oram]: The radiophonic
workshop was concentrating

19:04.840 --> 19:07.440
somewhat on the drama side,

19:07.480 --> 19:10.000
and I wanted to concentrate
on the music side.

19:10.040 --> 19:16.280
So I set up my own studio.

19:16.320 --> 19:17.280
- She was a woman,

19:17.320 --> 19:19.200
in the 1950s,
set up her own

19:19.240 --> 19:21.680

music studio.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.480
It's extraordinarily brave.

19:23.520 --> 19:26.840
[Fluttering,

how do you go about

19:29.240 --> 19:30.680
this sort of sound?

19:30.720 --> 19:32.000
- Well, let me introduce

19:32.040 --> 19:34.160
this little electronic
generator here,

19:34.200 --> 19:36.200
which produces
a sound like this.

19:36.240 --> 19:38.360
[Resonant tone getting
progressively lower]

19:38.400 --> 19:40.760
Now I made a little
loop of tape here

19:40.800 --> 19:43.240
with varying pure
tones on it.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.240
[Rapidly ascending tones]

19:45.280 --> 19:48.720
Now if I then put a little
artificial reverberation

19:48.760 --> 19:50.360
on that,
I think you'll see

19:50.400 --> 19:52.160
we're just beginning
to get somewhere

19:52.200 --> 19:53.240
with the music.

three-and-a-half thousand
pounds that you've got?

20:52.080 --> 20:53.720
- Well, this is very
exciting to me

20:53.760 --> 20:57.200
because I have ideas for a
piece of electronic equipment,

20:57.240 --> 20:58.360
not quite like this.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.480
In this case,
the composer,

21:00.520 --> 21:03.800
we're going to be able to
feed in drawn symbols

21:03.840 --> 21:07.840
straight into the equipment
and out will come the sounds.

21:07.880 --> 21:11.320
[Rumbling]

21:11.360 --> 21:14.200
I have a new
technique completely,

21:14.240 --> 21:17.800
one that I've evolved
over the years,

21:17.840 --> 21:20.480
which I call oramics.

21:20.520 --> 21:24.760
Now that is using graphic
representation of sound.

21:24.800 --> 21:27.240
[Reverberating tones]

21:27.280 --> 21:30.160
There seems to be
no real notation system

21:30.200 --> 21:31.680
in electronic music.

21:31.720 --> 21:35.760
I wanted a system where I
could graphically represent

21:35.800 --> 21:39.240
what I wanted and
give that representation,

21:39.280 --> 21:42.040
that musical score,
in fact, to a machine

21:42.080 --> 21:44.960
and have from it
the sound.

[Reverberating tones

21:51.360 --> 21:55.720
[playful waltz of

21:55.760 --> 21:57.440
- This idea of drawn sound

21:57.480 --> 22:00.040
is a sound that
comes from nowhere.

22:00.080 --> 22:04.200
It's a sound that is
synthesised from nothing,

22:04.240 --> 22:06.160
but she's not the
ghost in the machine

22:06.200 --> 22:08.160
her hands are
all over it.

22:08.200 --> 22:23.280
[playful waltz continues]

22:23.320 --> 22:26.960
- The composer wants to
project something of himself.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.240
The great works of art are a
projection of a human mind.

22:31.280 --> 22:35.240
And unless this machine can
accept and produce exactly

22:35.280 --> 22:38.200
this projection of the
composer's thought,

22:38.320 --> 22:41.560
then I think it's just a
machine and I can quite see

22:41.600 --> 22:44.000
why people can get
frightened at the thought.

28:04.520 --> 28:08.200
It was unbelievable,

28:12.040 --> 28:17.800
We were married in '48 and
Louis's cousin brought us

28:17.840 --> 28:21.640

28:21.680 --> 28:24.000
I think we were the

28:24.040 --> 28:26.480
with that machine.

28:26.520 --> 28:30.160
We had all the artists in

a recording studio.

28:58.320 --> 29:02.080
We built almost all the

And the desire to build

[Bubbling sounds dance

29:30.200 --> 29:31.640

Louis made sounds

29:31.680 --> 29:34.320
by overloading circuit boards,

29:34.360 --> 29:39.320
which Bebe then processed and
manipulated to create music.

To the writer,

are not instruments.

They are performance.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.320

everything that
came out of the circuits.

31:19.120 --> 31:23.080
It was the first movie with
an all-electronic score.

31:23.120 --> 31:26.080
[Whale-like moaning]

31:26.320 --> 31:30.080
- The pride and joy of
that period was in coming up

31:30.120 --> 31:32.360
with the music
for the monster.

31:32.400 --> 31:36.200
[Descending, spinning tone
meets an ascending moan]

31:36.240 --> 31:38.880
We were just
beside ourselves.

31:38.920 --> 31:42.680
Suddenly, this circuit
started generating

31:42.720 --> 31:47.560
the most complex sounds.

31:47.600 --> 31:53.920
The dying of Morbius was the
actual dying of the circuit.

31:53.960 --> 31:55.920
[Deep moaning]

31:55.960 --> 32:02.000
[Harsh, distressed
screeching]

32:02.040 --> 32:14.280
[Screeching getting
higher and higher]

32:14.320 --> 32:19.520
[Tones descend into silence]

32:19.560 --> 32:25.760
[Bubbling sounds]

32:25.800 --> 32:27.600
- [Louis]: We would
have a credit that said,

32:27.640 --> 32:31.240
"Electronic music by
Louis and Bebe Barron."

32:31.280 --> 32:33.960
But a memo was circulated
among the executives.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.240
How would the American
Federation of Musicians

32:36.280 --> 32:40.560
respond to a credit that
says electronic music?

32:41.840 --> 32:44.160
- The Musicians' Union would not

32:44.200 --> 32:49.000
allow the soundtrack
to be considered music.

32:49.040 --> 32:51.520
[Haunting, spinning tones
sprinkled with bubbling sounds]

32:51.560 --> 32:54.320
They were afraid that someday
their jobs would be replaced

32:54.360 --> 32:57.920
by machines and so they
would have none of it.

32:58.760 --> 33:02.560
That's why it's credited
as "electronic tonalities."

33:02.600 --> 33:07.200
[Deep, haunting sounds]

33:07.240 --> 33:09.920
- [Bebe]: It was so awful.

33:09.960 --> 33:16.480
We were barely
acknowledged as composers.

33:16.520 --> 33:19.280
[Harsh, metallic
swell of sound]

33:19.320 --> 33:22.480
[Rhythmic,
determined melody]

33:25.880 --> 33:32.480
[Sweeping whoosh of air]

33:32.520 --> 33:42.360
[Mysterious space-like
melody]

33:42.760 --> 33:44.280
- Prior to Dr. Who,

33:44.320 --> 33:49.280
there's a lot of distaste
of electronic music.

33:49.320 --> 33:52.280
Delia's music is
absolutely crucial

33:52.320 --> 33:54.760
in changing
that perception.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.440
[Mysterious,
reverberating tones]

33:56.480 --> 33:59.000
- [Woman]: It's like a
lighthouse, isn't it?

33:59.040 --> 34:01.160
I wonder what it's like up
there in a thunderstorm.

34:01.200 --> 34:03.760
Think of being up there
on a starry night,

34:03.800 --> 34:06.240
with all the world
at your feet.

34:06.280 --> 34:08.280
- You get people
who are writing in

34:08.320 --> 34:09.320
saying, "What is this?"

34:09.360 --> 34:11.320
"How is it made?"

34:11.360 --> 34:13.720
- Imagine what life must
have been like

34:13.760 --> 34:16.040
before samplers,
before synthesizers,

34:16.080 --> 34:18.760
before sequencers?

34:18.800 --> 34:21.280
It took her 40 days to make
the Doctor Who theme.

34:21.320 --> 34:23.720
40 days.

34:27.240 --> 34:30.240
- She would sample
a green lamp shade,

34:30.280 --> 34:33.240
speed it up,
reverse it,

34:33.280 --> 34:36.200
and just completely changed
the nature of the sound.

34:36.240 --> 34:38.520
[Bell chiming]

34:38.560 --> 34:41.520
[Sustained,
warm bell tones]

34:41.560 --> 34:45.520
[Birds chirping]

34:45.560 --> 34:47.840
- This was a
documentary program

34:47.880 --> 34:52.000
about the Tuareg tribe,

34:52.040 --> 34:57.160
the Tuareg tribe of nomads
in the Sahara desert.

34:57.200 --> 35:00.560
In the piece,
I tried to convey

35:00.600 --> 35:06.280
the distance of the horizon
and the heat haze,

35:06.320 --> 35:11.280
the strand of camels
wandering across the desert.

35:11.320 --> 35:14.200
That, in fact, was made
from square waves

35:14.240 --> 35:18.280
put through every filter
I could possibly find.

35:18.320 --> 35:35.280
[Harsh sustained tones over
warm, swelling bell tones]

35:37.520 --> 35:40.240
- [Barry performing]:
There must be a god.

35:40.800 --> 35:41.560
Oh, yes.

35:41.600 --> 35:49.160
[Ethereal, layered
choral chanting]

35:49.200 --> 35:51.280
Delia Derbyshire created

35:51.320 --> 35:53.200
some very, very
beautiful things

35:53.240 --> 35:54.160
and some things that had

35:54.200 --> 35:56.440
a very strange and
unearthly quality

35:56.480 --> 35:59.680
that couldn't quite be got, I think,
by normal musical means

35:59.720 --> 36:01.360
and yet didn't
sound as if

36:01.400 --> 36:03.360
they were electronically
manufactured.

36:03.400 --> 36:09.920
[Ethereal choral
chanting continues]

36:09.960 --> 36:14.520
- Some of it was
worked out mathematically.

36:14.560 --> 36:16.320
[Repeated beeping tones]

36:16.360 --> 36:18.320
I've tried to get into it

36:18.360 --> 36:24.720
a feeling of simplicity
and loneliness,

36:24.760 --> 36:26.720
of a man on a moon.

36:26.760 --> 36:37.240
[Ethereal,
sliding melody]

36:37.280 --> 36:39.960
- [Neil Armstrong]: That's
one small step for man,

36:41.080 --> 36:45.320
one giant leap
for mankind.

36:48.160 --> 36:49.840
- [Mandy]: She created
a kind of pathway

36:49.880 --> 36:52.240
for electronic music.

36:52.280 --> 36:53.520
- [Delia]: I did all
sorts of things

36:53.560 --> 36:55.560
I was told I couldn't do.

36:55.600 --> 37:00.760
I think I've always been a
very independent thinker.

37:04.200 --> 37:05.560
[Ethereal, sliding
melody ends]

37:05.600 --> 37:08.560
[Bomb exploding]

37:08.600 --> 37:23.960
[Rumbling sound
expands, then fades]

37:24.000 --> 37:25.280
- [Female Narrator]: While
the work of women

37:25.320 --> 37:27.240
like Delia and Daphne

37:27.280 --> 37:30.040
came from the deafening
sounds of wartime,

37:30.080 --> 37:33.200
it was the chilling silence
of the Cold War

37:33.240 --> 37:40.200
that took others to
the limits of listening.

37:40.240 --> 37:42.240
- The bomb scare psychology

37:42.280 --> 37:44.160
that was inculcated,

37:44.200 --> 37:46.240
that had a big
effect on the artists

37:46.280 --> 37:48.600
that were emerging
at that time.

37:48.640 --> 37:53.720
[Upbeat guitar music]

37:53.760 --> 37:57.240
Everybody was pushing
for opening things up,

37:57.280 --> 38:00.480
a kind of way through
all the terrible stuff

38:00.520 --> 38:02.200
that was going on in
the world at the time.

38:02.240 --> 38:04.480
So there was a lot of
political motivation behind

38:04.520 --> 38:05.800
what we were doing.

38:05.840 --> 38:06.800
- [Protestors] Peace now!

38:06.840 --> 38:09.000
Peace now!
Peace now!

38:09.040 --> 38:11.280
[Crowd cheering]

38:12.280 --> 38:13.480
- [David Rosenboom]: The
effect was to say,

38:13.520 --> 38:16.800
okay, we've got
to break through

38:16.840 --> 38:20.000
anything that was rigid,
anything that was limiting,

38:20.040 --> 38:22.680
and try to move
things forward.

38:22.720 --> 38:30.160
[Space-like, harsh,
high-pitched tones]

38:30.200 --> 38:31.600
- The music scene

38:31.640 --> 38:35.280
was evolving into
an area that was

38:35.320 --> 38:38.760
very fresh and exciting.

38:38.800 --> 38:42.800
[Screaming,
elongated tones]

38:42.840 --> 38:45.200
First time I heard
live electronic music

38:45.240 --> 38:47.160
was early '60s.

38:47.200 --> 38:50.200
Pauline was on stage
with an accordion.

38:50.240 --> 38:53.160
The room was exploding with a
sound that was ear-splitting.

38:53.200 --> 38:57.680
I had never experienced
that kind of volume before.

38:57.720 --> 39:11.160
[Piercing, screaming tones
ascending and descending]

39:11.200 --> 39:11.960
- [Pauline Oliveros]:
I can't remember

39:12.000 --> 39:15.160
when I wasn't
interested in sounds.

39:15.200 --> 39:19.920
I remember particularly
things like riding in the car

39:19.960 --> 39:23.000
with my parents for instance,
maybe in the backseat,

39:23.040 --> 39:25.280
listening to the sound
of the motor

39:25.320 --> 39:28.680
and listening to the sound
of my parents' voices

39:28.720 --> 39:30.280
being modulated by the motor.

39:30.320 --> 39:33.680
[Muffled conversation]

39:33.720 --> 39:36.680
Listening to my father
turn his shortwave radio,

39:36.720 --> 39:40.160
listening to the whistles
and pops and static.

39:40.200 --> 39:41.800
I mean, I was
always fascinated with

39:41.840 --> 39:44.800
the in-between sounds
in the stations,

39:44.840 --> 39:46.160
just tuning in between.

39:46.200 --> 39:47.440
I loved that.

39:47.480 --> 39:51.320
[Radio tuning]

39:51.360 --> 39:54.320
I credit my mother.

39:54.360 --> 39:56.160
For my birthday, she
sent me a tape recorder,

39:56.200 --> 39:58.800
and that was a very
significant event

39:58.840 --> 40:01.440
because nobody had
tape recorders, you know.

40:01.480 --> 40:03.160
It was in the 50s.

40:03.200 --> 40:09.480
[Relaxed, marching
dance music]

40:09.520 --> 40:13.800
I began to do field recording
from my apartment window.

40:13.840 --> 40:17.720
[High-pitched screeching tones
Trolley bell ringing]

40:17.760 --> 40:21.320
And then in 1959
got started making

40:21.360 --> 40:24.040
a tape piece called
Time Perspectives.

40:24.080 --> 40:25.240
[Wind chimes ringing]

40:27.120 --> 40:38.280
[Hollow object sliding
on a surface]

40:38.320 --> 40:41.200
The tape recorder that I had,
it was possible to record

40:41.240 --> 40:45.280
by hand winding the
tape in record mode.

40:45.320 --> 40:47.440
That gave me a variable
speed so I could do

40:47.480 --> 40:49.440
some interesting
things with that.

40:49.480 --> 40:51.280
[Bells continue ringing]

40:51.320 --> 40:54.200
[Sounds resembling
birds cawing]

40:54.240 --> 40:57.360
And I used the bathtub for
reverberation [chuckles]

40:57.400 --> 41:01.760
and cardboard tubes as filters.

41:01.800 --> 41:04.320
I'd put microphones in the
tube and then record sounds

41:04.360 --> 41:05.720
through the tube.

41:05.760 --> 41:13.040
[Hollow sound of
water gurgling]

41:13.080 --> 41:17.280
[Airy wash of sound]

41:19.280 --> 41:21.160
[Sustained accordion chord]

41:21.200 --> 41:23.320
[Object dropping]

41:28.000 --> 41:30.240
Eventually, I met up
with a group of people

41:30.280 --> 41:32.280
who were interested
in new music,

41:32.320 --> 41:34.520
[Haunting,
avant-garde music]

41:34.560 --> 41:36.200
which led to
the founding of

41:36.240 --> 41:39.280
the San Francisco
Tape Music Center.

41:42.280 --> 41:44.080
- The San Francisco
Tape Music Center

41:44.120 --> 41:47.160
was not associated
with an institution.

41:47.200 --> 41:50.240
So it was friends brought
together what equipment

41:50.280 --> 41:53.200
they had to share.

41:55.240 --> 41:57.240
- Our sense of what
we were doing

41:57.280 --> 42:01.360
at that point was opening
a place where poets,

42:01.400 --> 42:06.080
painters, film, and
electronic or tape music,

42:06.120 --> 42:07.360
where all this stuff
could be done.

42:07.400 --> 42:09.720
[Echoing,
haunting sounds]

42:09.760 --> 42:11.520
It was a sense
of individuality.

42:11.560 --> 42:13.840
Nobody wanted to
be like anyone else

42:13.880 --> 42:16.080
and everybody was
very supportive

42:16.120 --> 42:19.200
of what everybody
else was doing.

42:22.360 --> 42:25.760
- My interest was always
in live performance

42:25.800 --> 42:29.280
and I started to find out
ways to use tape recorders

42:29.320 --> 42:33.160
and perform live with them,
and that was making

42:33.200 --> 42:35.280
a tape delay system,
which allows me

42:35.320 --> 42:38.760
to maintain that physical
contact with the sound.

42:38.800 --> 42:42.280
[Screeching,
high-pitched tone]

42:42.520 --> 43:19.520
[Classical choral music
begins as tone continues]

43:19.880 --> 43:21.520
- [Female Narrator]: How do
you exercise the canon of

43:21.560 --> 43:25.760
classical music of misogyny

43:25.800 --> 43:29.800
with two oscillators,
a turntable, and tape delay?

43:34.360 --> 43:35.800
- Feminism was at the center

43:35.840 --> 43:36.760
of what she was doing,

43:36.800 --> 43:39.360
and it's strange because it
seems like if the boys' club

43:39.400 --> 43:42.200
is going to pick a token
woman, you would not pick

43:42.240 --> 43:45.320
a woman who is
that outspoken.

43:45.360 --> 43:48.600
[Drone-like tone]

43:48.840 --> 43:50.760
- Pauline was conscious
of the fact that

43:50.800 --> 43:52.280
she was different.

43:52.320 --> 43:55.200
She had a streak of
a revolutionary in her.

43:59.200 --> 44:00.920
- Pauline, it was hard,
you know,

44:00.960 --> 44:02.240
she had come
out in the 50s

44:02.280 --> 44:06.200
and here she was
a woman, gay,

44:06.240 --> 44:08.240
avant-garde music,

44:08.280 --> 44:10.720
each thing by itself
would be hard,

44:10.760 --> 44:12.440
but she had three
things that were hard

44:12.480 --> 44:13.840
and women composers

44:13.880 --> 44:15.920
were not being
performed, you know.

44:15.960 --> 44:22.160
[Choral voices emerge
over the drone-like tone]

44:22.200 --> 44:23.520
- [Male Interviewer]: You
wrote an editorial

44:23.560 --> 44:25.240
to the New York Times
once called

44:25.280 --> 44:26.440
"Don't Call Them
'Lady' Composers"

44:26.480 --> 44:27.840
- [Pauline]: That's right.
- Tell us about

44:27.880 --> 44:29.760
when you wrote
that and why.

44:29.800 --> 44:32.440
- [Pauline]: I just want to be
introduced as a composer.

44:32.480 --> 44:35.160
That has caused me
to use that title

44:35.200 --> 44:37.160
and to start
to point out

44:37.200 --> 44:40.320
how hard it was for women
to be taken seriously

44:40.360 --> 44:43.160
as creators of music.

44:43.200 --> 45:11.240
[Drone-like and choral
tones continue]

45:11.280 --> 45:15.960
- [Female Narrator]: Go
out walking at night.

45:16.000 --> 45:22.200
Tread so quietly the bottoms
of your feet become ears.

45:22.240 --> 45:25.000
Working with an
all-women ensemble,

45:25.040 --> 45:27.200
instructions like these were
intended to encourage

45:27.240 --> 45:29.000
deep listening.

45:29.040 --> 45:35.280
[Drone-like tone continues]

45:35.320 --> 45:46.280
[Long tones
resembling brass]

45:46.320 --> 45:47.280
- [Pauline]: I was alarmed

45:47.320 --> 45:48.920
as many were,
of course,

45:48.960 --> 45:51.320
with the Vietnam War,

45:51.360 --> 45:55.040
and I began to seek some ways
of working with sound

45:55.080 --> 46:00.200
that I could discover more
of a kind of inner peace.

46:02.320 --> 46:10.240
[Drone-like and brass
tones continue]

46:10.280 --> 46:14.280
I found myself listening
to long sounds

46:14.320 --> 46:16.560
and becoming more
interested in

46:16.600 --> 46:18.840
what the sounds
did themselves

46:18.880 --> 46:22.480
than what I would
do with them.

46:22.520 --> 46:27.240
And as this work proceeded,

46:27.280 --> 46:31.200
I began to become interested
in what the kind of listening

46:31.240 --> 46:38.160
I was doing did to me and my
own internal processes.

46:38.200 --> 46:42.760

- [Female Interviewer]:
Does it have

46:46.480 --> 46:49.080
social and political
implications to you,

46:49.120 --> 46:50.600
the kind of music
that you write?

46:50.640 --> 46:52.040
- Oh, yes.

46:52.080 --> 46:57.440
Well, I feel that
one's interactions,

46:57.720 --> 47:01.760
the way one relates in an
organization of any kind,

47:01.800 --> 47:07.720
is political and social
and very important.

47:07.760 --> 47:11.360
The path that I hope to be on
is one where the energy

47:11.400 --> 47:16.600
that comes out of the work
that I do is beneficial

47:16.640 --> 47:18.320
to others as
well as myself.

47:18.360 --> 47:21.840
I want my work to be
mutually beneficial.

47:21.880 --> 47:23.240
I'm not interested in

47:23.280 --> 47:26.560
making an object of
art and entertainment.

47:26.600 --> 47:29.280
I'm interested in making
something that helps me

47:29.320 --> 47:32.800
to grow and expand and
change as an individual

47:33.960 --> 47:37.160
and in relation
to others.

47:37.200 --> 47:48.040
[Warm, layered

47:52.040 --> 47:53.200
how we hear and feel

47:53.240 --> 47:55.600
the sounds within
and around us

47:55.640 --> 47:59.280
were shared by
Maryanne Amacher at MIT,

47:59.320 --> 48:01.480
who was sounding
out the city.

high-pitched sounds]

48:07.360 --> 48:13.560
[Seagulls cawing]

48:13.600 --> 48:15.240
- I had installed a
microphone

48:15.280 --> 48:19.320
in eight locations at
the Boston Harbour

48:19.360 --> 48:22.240
in the New England
Fish Exchange

48:22.280 --> 48:26.200
connected to
telephone links.

48:28.360 --> 48:30.200
It was very nice to
come in late at night

48:30.240 --> 48:31.360
at 1:00 in the morning

48:31.400 --> 48:34.760
and just turn on the
mixer and have the sound

48:34.800 --> 48:38.720
coming from the distant
night when I liked it best

48:38.760 --> 48:41.360
because I could hear
patterns in various shapes.

[Seagulls cawing]

48:44.280 --> 48:47.320
[Fluttering high-pitched

48:47.360 --> 48:50.800
I realized, my, there's
a tone of this place.

48:50.840 --> 48:52.800
There's a whole undercurrent
that exists here

48:52.840 --> 48:57.200
that makes this
recognisable in some way.

48:57.240 --> 48:59.320
It wasn't hard to
analyse it in Boston.

48:59.360 --> 49:02.160
It was like a low F sharp.

49:02.200 --> 49:04.240
Then other places,
for example, New York,

49:04.280 --> 49:05.960
it was like a low E.

49:06.000 --> 49:10.960
[Subway train clattering]

49:11.000 --> 49:13.560
It wasn't that I wanted
the sounds of the birds

49:13.600 --> 49:16.480
or the sounds of the harbour
or any of these sounds,

49:16.520 --> 49:21.480
I really wanted to experience
and learn about hearing.

49:21.520 --> 49:26.040
[Pleasant harmony of tones]

49:26.080 --> 49:27.040
- [Male Interviewer]:
When people say to you,

49:27.080 --> 49:28.000
"Yeah, but is it music?"

49:28.040 --> 49:29.320
After you say,
"Yes it is,"

49:29.360 --> 49:31.160
how do you
expand on that?

49:31.200 --> 49:32.320
- [Maryanne]: Well,
I think that's sort of

49:32.360 --> 49:34.080
an old question
[chuckles].

49:34.120 --> 49:36.760
Much of our music, classical
pop, has this beat,

49:36.800 --> 49:39.280
has this gallop,
has this trot.

49:39.320 --> 49:44.480
I'm interested in music that
communicates some ideas,

49:46.480 --> 49:49.240
finding places where there is
space and dimension

49:49.280 --> 49:50.560
to the sound,

and very close up.

49:54.040 --> 49:58.400
[Deep, airy sounds]

49:58.560 --> 50:00.840
- Maryanne was really
interested in

50:00.880 --> 50:02.520
contemporary science.

50:02.560 --> 50:05.200
She had been very interested
in muon research,

50:05.240 --> 50:08.360
these particles that speed
through the universe.

50:09.240 --> 50:12.200
- She was constantly
thinking about

50:12.240 --> 50:17.480
intersections of science,
life, and sound.

50:17.520 --> 50:22.800
[Airy and metallic,
droning sounds]

50:22.840 --> 50:24.720
- Her house
was incredible.

50:24.760 --> 50:29.760
It was in breathtakingly
bad condition.

50:29.800 --> 50:31.080
There was this
whole rack

50:31.120 --> 50:33.280
full of these sine
wave oscillators

50:33.320 --> 50:38.080
straight out of
a physics lab.

50:38.120 --> 50:39.320
And there's this

buzzy energy.

50:43.040 --> 50:46.280
[Quivering metallic sounds]

50:46.320 --> 50:49.200

rock-and-roll attitude

towards, "I'm going to
make this whole house

50:55.280 --> 51:19.240
[Metallic sounds intensify
and rumble]

51:24.880 --> 51:28.160
- She wanted to
develop an extremely

rigorous approach
to listening,

51:30.560 --> 51:32.840
[Low, constant tone

51:32.880 --> 51:35.240
to activating sights,

She didn't want
to push around

51:45.000 --> 51:48.320
dead white men's notes.

51:54.320 --> 51:58.080
- I wanted to
create music where

51:58.120 --> 52:00.360
the listener actually had

52:00.400 --> 52:05.280
vivid experiences
of contributing.

52:05.800 --> 52:09.040
In composing, I am
conscious of the tones

52:09.080 --> 52:12.320
that you make in
response to the tones

52:12.360 --> 52:14.240
that a musician plays.

52:14.280 --> 52:19.280
[Subtle, harsh violin

52:19.320 --> 52:20.480
- One of the phenomenon
she was

52:20.520 --> 52:23.160
most interested in was
otoacoustic emission.

52:23.200 --> 52:26.560
She referred to
them as ear tones.

52:26.600 --> 52:29.280
If you have two frequencies
and they sound together,

52:29.320 --> 52:32.200
the ear and the mind try
to sort of resolve them.

52:32.240 --> 52:36.240
There is an emergent
third pitch.

52:37.240 --> 52:39.840
She can compose these outer
things that will produce

52:39.880 --> 52:40.960
this inner thing.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.440
[low, constant tone

52:51.080 --> 52:53.280
- The first time one
encounters her music

52:53.320 --> 52:55.920
and the way that it
dances inside your ear

52:55.960 --> 52:58.600
is this light bulb moment.

52:58.640 --> 53:00.280
You can actually play with

53:00.320 --> 53:03.280
the physicality
of the listener.

53:21.720 --> 53:22.680
[Sustained, chant-like tones]

53:25.040 --> 53:27.280
[High pitch and

53:27.320 --> 53:29.280
And then there
would be thunder,

53:29.320 --> 53:30.600
[Thunder rumbling softly]

53:30.640 --> 53:34.680
beautiful thunder recorded
in stereoscopic sound

the room.

53:36.240 --> 53:41.240
[Thunder rumbles swell]

53:41.280 --> 53:44.440
And when it hit, there
would be this array

53:44.480 --> 53:47.320
of other frequencies
that would happen.

53:47.360 --> 53:49.760
It was very very beautiful.

The idea of

a slowly-evolving composition

54:26.400 --> 54:28.360

54:28.400 --> 54:32.800
also fired the imagination

55:22.280 --> 55:23.160
- When I met Eliane,

55:23.200 --> 55:26.800
she had been working with
the Buchla synthesizer,

55:26.840 --> 55:29.800
yet this piece that
she wrote, Chry-ptus,

55:29.840 --> 55:34.200
sounded nothing
like a Buchla.

56:21.640 --> 56:23.280
Are you working with
both synthesisers

56:23.320 --> 56:25.560
and tape recording
processes?

56:25.600 --> 56:29.280
- [Eliane]: Yes,
the ARP synthesiser

56:29.320 --> 56:35.160
and the tape recorder.

56:35.200 --> 56:38.160
My main involvement with
music is to work on

56:38.200 --> 56:41.760
slow changing
of the sounds.

56:41.800 --> 56:42.440
- [Charles]: So in a way,

56:42.480 --> 56:44.360
you're working with time?

56:44.400 --> 56:47.320
- [Eliane]: Yes,
my last work, Adnos II,

56:47.360 --> 56:51.320
is 75 minutes long,
and it couldn't be shorter.

56:51.360 --> 56:54.440
It just goes like a stream.

56:54.480 --> 57:04.200
[Constant tone slightly

57:04.240 --> 57:11.720
[A dissonant tone emerges]

57:11.760 --> 57:13.360
I should say that
this music I make

57:13.400 --> 57:14.760
is not so much welcome,

57:14.800 --> 57:17.440
except by a few
people, of course.

57:17.480 --> 57:19.160
There is nothing in between.

57:19.200 --> 57:21.560
People likes it,
or not at all.

57:21.600 --> 57:23.040
For the music establishment,

57:23.080 --> 57:25.320
they think that I
don't make music.

57:25.360 --> 57:27.520
That's not music.

57:27.560 --> 57:30.080
- [Charles] Oh, still arguing
about that, are we?

57:30.120 --> 57:32.520
[Eliane laughs]

57:33.200 --> 57:36.280
- Our music was meant
to be listened to

57:36.320 --> 57:38.320
in a different way than
how you'd listen to, like,

57:38.360 --> 57:41.160
a pop song.

57:41.200 --> 57:43.440
In a pop song
you're listening for

57:43.480 --> 57:45.800
melodies, harmonies, lyrics.

57:45.840 --> 57:48.440
In her music, you're
listening not just

57:48.480 --> 57:51.160
for the things that are
changing in the sound,

57:51.200 --> 57:53.160
but for the way
that the experience

57:53.200 --> 57:55.760
is changing your disposition.

make it start very dull

59:39.240 --> 59:41.520
and then get very
bright like that.

59:41.560 --> 59:43.840
It sounds more like

recontextualizing these classic
Western art music tropes,

1:00:11.200 --> 1:00:20.280
that takes a lot of strength,
humour, and vision.

1:00:20.320 --> 1:00:21.560
- [Suzanne]: Up until
that moment,

1:00:21.600 --> 1:00:23.560
electronic music
had this promise

1:00:23.600 --> 1:00:26.200
of a different vocabulary,
a different language,

1:00:26.240 --> 1:00:31.760
a new paradigm,
a new way of working.

Switched-On Bach,
the way it impacted

1:00:34.200 --> 1:00:40.280
the public's consciousness
of what a synthesiser was,

1:00:40.320 --> 1:00:42.280
was completely retroactive.

1:00:42.320 --> 1:00:44.240
[Bach piece playing
on synthesizer]

1:00:44.280 --> 1:00:48.200
Everybody thought that
these things were about

1:00:48.240 --> 1:00:53.240
replicating sounds.

1:00:53.280 --> 1:00:58.320
To me, electronic music wasn't
about making baroque music

1:00:58.360 --> 1:01:00.320
with new timbres.

1:01:00.360 --> 1:01:05.200
It was a different
kind of music.

1:01:05.240 --> 1:01:08.160
You just had the
Summer of Love.

1:01:08.200 --> 1:01:13.200
Everything we knew
was being thrown out,

1:01:13.240 --> 1:01:15.240
and it was a whole new world.

1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:17.600
Electronics were
part of that world.

1:01:17.640 --> 1:01:18.960
[Ascending and descending

- Oh, these are

1:01:22.080 --> 1:01:24.320
These are the things
that route the signal

1:01:24.360 --> 1:01:27.160
from one little module to
another to get the sound.

1:01:27.200 --> 1:01:30.840
You can patch it a lot of
different ways and the way

1:01:30.880 --> 1:01:33.760
you patch it will
determine what you get.

1:01:33.800 --> 1:01:37.280
It's like creating
an instrument.

to sound like?

1:01:39.800 --> 1:01:42.240
- Well, you're always
going towards an idea.

1:01:42.280 --> 1:01:46.080
That's what makes you put the
patch cords in certain places.

1:01:46.120 --> 1:01:48.240
- [Suzanne]: Part of an
instrument is what it can do

1:01:48.280 --> 1:01:50.840
and part of it is
what you do to it.

1:01:50.880 --> 1:01:53.200
The other part of music of
course is the motion

1:01:53.240 --> 1:01:56.200
and the personal involvement
that a musician gives

1:01:56.240 --> 1:01:57.200
to his instrument,

1:01:57.240 --> 1:01:59.160
and that's something
that I happen to feel

1:01:59.200 --> 1:02:01.560
and have with
synthesisers.

1:02:01.600 --> 1:02:03.960
So I play the synthesiser
the same way

1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:08.480
somebody else would
play cello or violin.

1:02:08.520 --> 1:02:12.920
[Majestic melody begins
over the scales]

1:02:12.960 --> 1:02:15.280
- For a classically
trained pianist

1:02:15.320 --> 1:02:17.920
to turn her back
on a keyboard,

1:02:17.960 --> 1:02:19.200
she's crazy.

1:02:19.240 --> 1:02:21.320
It was like learning
a new language

1:02:21.360 --> 1:02:24.200
via the means of cutting
out your own tongue.

1:02:24.240 --> 1:02:25.680
- [Suzanne speaking as
harmonies mimic her voice]:

1:02:25.720 --> 1:02:27.040
Yeah, I can sing
out of tune

1:02:27.080 --> 1:02:28.280
and it'll still be in tune

1:02:28.320 --> 1:02:30.280
because it depends on
what I'm playing.

1:02:30.320 --> 1:02:33.080
This is all the pitch so you
don't have to really be able

1:02:33.120 --> 1:02:35.360
to sing to do this.

1:02:35.400 --> 1:02:37.360
So, it's great.
it's great.

1:02:37.400 --> 1:02:38.240
Hello, hello, hello.

1:02:38.280 --> 1:02:39.360
[Suzanne Narrating]:
I couldn't get a record deal

1:02:39.400 --> 1:02:40.680
because the record companies

1:02:40.720 --> 1:02:45.440
were not interested in a
woman who did not sing.

1:02:45.480 --> 1:02:49.200
Advertising wanted
to be on the edge.

1:02:49.240 --> 1:02:52.240
They were looking for
something different.

1:02:52.280 --> 1:02:54.360
I had total freedom.

1:02:54.400 --> 1:02:57.240
Nobody could tell
me what to do.

1:02:57.280 --> 1:02:58.360
They didn't know what I did.

1:02:58.400 --> 1:03:03.000
[Mysterious chiming music]

1:03:03.200 --> 1:03:07.360
[Electronic squeaky melody]

1:03:07.560 --> 1:03:09.160
- [Male Announcer]: The new
Clairol custom care

1:03:09.200 --> 1:03:10.720
coon brush.

1:03:10.760 --> 1:03:13.520
[Upbeat rock-like music]

1:03:13.560 --> 1:03:14.520
- [Male Announcer]:
Atari is going to

1:03:14.560 --> 1:03:15.560
turn your head around.

1:03:15.600 --> 1:03:16.560
[Exploding sound]

1:03:16.600 --> 1:03:17.960
- [Male Announcer]: Big
news from Covergirl.

1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:20.240
- There's a whole new
thick lash mascara.

1:03:20.280 --> 1:03:24.000
[Liquid pouring with
electronic bubbling sound]

1:03:24.040 --> 1:03:26.160
- The landscape that
she must have walked into

1:03:26.200 --> 1:03:28.160
must have been like
something from Mad Men.

1:03:28.200 --> 1:03:30.160
I remember Suzanne
telling me stories like

1:03:30.200 --> 1:03:32.240
she'd turn up
early to set up

1:03:32.280 --> 1:03:34.240
all the modular
gear in studios

1:03:34.280 --> 1:03:36.520
and a young engineer
would come in and go,

1:03:36.560 --> 1:03:37.720
"Which mic are you
going to sing on?"

1:03:37.760 --> 1:03:39.240
or, "What are you
going to sing for us?"

1:03:39.280 --> 1:03:40.080
Because those
stereotypes were

1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:42.360
so commonplace in
studios in those days.

1:03:42.400 --> 1:03:43.960
[Upbeat rock music]

1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:44.960
- [Suzanne speaking as
chords mirror her voice]:

1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:47.240
Welcome to Xenon.

1:03:47.280 --> 1:03:49.600
- More than anybody else,

1:03:49.640 --> 1:03:55.240
she built a career out of
making weird music,

1:03:55.280 --> 1:03:59.520
which is something I think
everybody aspires to.

1:03:59.560 --> 1:04:01.240
She had her own company.

1:04:01.280 --> 1:04:03.240
She was able to turn
her art into something

1:04:03.280 --> 1:04:04.240
she can live on.

1:04:04.280 --> 1:04:06.520
[Suzanne's sigh is mirrored
by a low electronic echo]

1:04:06.560 --> 1:04:10.160
- [Suzanne with a low and
echoey voice]: Don't be afraid.

1:04:10.200 --> 1:04:14.240
This is my almost male voice.

1:04:14.280 --> 1:04:16.280
[Audience laughs and applauds]

1:04:16.320 --> 1:04:18.240
- Make the thing
make noises for us.

1:04:18.280 --> 1:04:19.000
- Okay, let's-

1:04:19.040 --> 1:04:20.960
- Now first of all, why
do you have this stuff?

1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:21.600
What do you do with this?

1:04:21.640 --> 1:04:23.960
- Well, this is how
I make a living.

1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:27.160
- But I mean, you don't
go door-to-door saying,

1:04:27.200 --> 1:04:29.680
I'll make you sound goofy.

1:04:29.720 --> 1:04:30.280
- Yeah, they call me.
they call me.

1:04:30.320 --> 1:04:33.000
- They call you.

1:04:33.040 --> 1:04:48.240
[Complex wash of
sound slowly ascends]

1:04:48.280 --> 1:04:49.520
- [Suzanne] Should I stop?

1:04:49.560 --> 1:04:52.920
- No, let it go for
about half an hour.

1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:53.200
[Sound stops]

1:04:53.240 --> 1:04:54.280
That's wonderful.

1:04:54.320 --> 1:04:59.240
[Audience applauds]

1:04:59.280 --> 1:05:01.320
- [Suzanne]: It was 1980.

1:05:01.360 --> 1:05:02.480
I was hired to do a
Hollywood feature.

1:05:02.520 --> 1:05:05.080
[Hollow, spinning sound
gets progressively higher]

1:05:05.120 --> 1:05:07.240
It was a Lily Tomlin movie.

1:05:07.280 --> 1:05:11.320
Lily was a woman, the
head of the production

1:05:11.360 --> 1:05:14.040
at Universal was a woman.

1:05:14.080 --> 1:05:16.200
So I had two women
in positions of power.

1:05:16.240 --> 1:05:18.720
And guess what?
I got hired.

1:05:18.760 --> 1:05:20.240
- Is that package for me?

1:05:20.280 --> 1:05:22.720
- Mike, it's for me.

1:05:22.760 --> 1:05:25.160
I didn't know I was
the first woman

1:05:25.200 --> 1:05:29.160
to be hired to score a
major Hollywood feature,

1:05:29.200 --> 1:05:33.360
and I didn't know that
it would be 14 years

1:05:33.400 --> 1:05:35.240
until another
woman was hired.

1:05:35.280 --> 1:05:37.920
[Hollow, spinning sound
gets progressively higher]

1:05:37.960 --> 1:05:42.680
We are casualties of
a day-to-day system

1:05:42.720 --> 1:05:46.200
that operates
without awareness

1:05:46.240 --> 1:05:48.240
that we're even there.

1:05:48.280 --> 1:05:50.240
âª Galaxy glue âª

1:05:56.280 --> 1:05:57.680
- [Laurie]: There weren't
any women composers

1:05:57.720 --> 1:05:58.280
that I knew of.

1:05:58.320 --> 1:06:00.000
I had never heard of one.

1:06:00.040 --> 1:06:02.160
[Rapid percussive tones]

1:06:02.200 --> 1:06:06.160
Composers were old
white dead men.

1:06:06.200 --> 1:06:09.160
It was just not something
I ever thought of

1:06:09.200 --> 1:06:12.080
as something I could do.

1:06:12.120 --> 1:06:14.360
When they asked
me in high school,

1:06:14.400 --> 1:06:16.280
"What would you like to
do with your life?"

1:06:16.320 --> 1:06:18.280
I said, "I would
love to do music."

1:06:18.320 --> 1:06:20.200
They said, "Totally
out of the question.

1:06:20.240 --> 1:06:22.440
"You would have needed
to have music lessons

1:06:22.480 --> 1:06:24.520
"all during your childhood."

1:06:24.560 --> 1:06:27.760
So I did a degree
in social sciences,

1:06:27.800 --> 1:06:32.560
but secretly I really always
wanted to do music.

1:06:32.600 --> 1:06:35.560
After I got my bachelor's and
moved to New York,

1:06:35.600 --> 1:06:37.000
I thought, I'm
going to regret it

1:06:37.040 --> 1:06:42.320
for the rest of my life if
I don't give it a real try.

1:06:42.360 --> 1:06:44.560
[Man singing a vocal warm-up]

1:06:44.600 --> 1:06:47.960
I was taking ear training
and music at Juilliard

1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:52.160
and happened to be in
Mike Czajkowski's class.

1:06:52.200 --> 1:06:55.160
And he was working
with Mort Subotnick.

1:06:55.200 --> 1:07:00.160
Mike dragged me down to
Mort's studio and it was like

1:07:00.200 --> 1:07:02.800
music went from black
and white to color.

1:07:02.840 --> 1:07:05.160
[Complex, drone-like
sound expands]

1:07:05.200 --> 1:07:07.160
I fell in love with
electronic music.

1:07:07.200 --> 1:07:09.280
It completely changed the
way I heard everything.

1:07:09.320 --> 1:07:11.560
The sounds of the
traffic in the street

1:07:11.600 --> 1:07:14.200
no longer sounded the same.

1:07:16.600 --> 1:07:19.000
I always wanted to do
something in the arts

1:07:19.040 --> 1:07:22.960
that had to do with the real,
authentic experience

1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:25.520
of being alive,
in contrast to

1:07:25.560 --> 1:07:29.480
the 1950s hypocritical
reality in which I lived,

1:07:29.520 --> 1:07:32.200
in which everything
was glossed over

1:07:32.240 --> 1:07:33.080
with cotton candy.

1:07:33.120 --> 1:07:33.720
[Spoon banging]

[Upbeat, sweeping

1:07:36.320 --> 1:07:38.280
- A perfect dinner Judy.

1:07:38.320 --> 1:07:40.280
And you said she
couldn't boil water

1:07:40.320 --> 1:07:44.680
without burning it.

1:07:44.720 --> 1:07:47.200
- [Laurie]: I got involved in
the downtown art scene,

1:07:47.240 --> 1:07:50.040
which is like "try
anything," you know?

1:07:50.080 --> 1:07:55.280
[Low drone]

1:07:55.320 --> 1:08:00.760
[Mechanical sounds]

1:08:00.800 --> 1:08:05.920
I tackled learning the Buchla
modular analogue system.

1:08:05.960 --> 1:08:08.200
While I could do all kinds of
wonderful things with sounds,

1:08:08.240 --> 1:08:12.960
what I really wanted was the
precision of the computer.

1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:17.560
I got involved with computers
in music out of frustration

1:08:17.600 --> 1:08:20.240
at other ways of
doing music, in part,

1:08:20.280 --> 1:08:23.240
and also because of
the incredible potential

1:08:23.280 --> 1:08:28.240
that they had for combining
the best of all other worlds,

1:08:28.280 --> 1:08:29.320
let's say.

1:08:29.360 --> 1:08:30.720
The memory, the logic,

1:08:30.760 --> 1:08:32.720
the ability to actually
interact with sound

1:08:32.760 --> 1:08:37.360
in real time began
to be possible.

1:08:37.400 --> 1:08:39.720
The complete freedom
to define

1:08:39.760 --> 1:08:42.240
any kind of world you wanted.

1:08:42.280 --> 1:08:49.560
[Warm, fluttering tones]

1:09:57.400 --> 1:10:01.960
Computers back then were the
enemy of the counterculture.

1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:04.600
Computers belonged to the
banks and the military

1:10:04.640 --> 1:10:07.240
and the insurance companies.

1:10:07.280 --> 1:10:11.040
Computer music was the utter
dehumanisation of music

1:10:11.080 --> 1:10:13.200
rather than,
to some few of us,

1:10:13.240 --> 1:10:14.520
the liberation of it.

1:10:14.560 --> 1:10:16.520

1:10:16.560 --> 1:10:18.160
- No, I haven't heard it.
I haven't heard it.

[Upbeat, alternating electronic

- Laurie Spiegel
was a ukulele player

1:10:55.240 --> 1:10:56.960
among other things.

1:10:57.000 --> 1:11:01.280
She had a sense of music
that is based in folk idioms,

1:11:01.320 --> 1:11:03.320
and Appalachian Grove

1:11:03.360 --> 1:11:06.160
is one of the earliest
computer music pieces

1:11:06.200 --> 1:11:08.480
that anyone would want
to listen to [laughs]

1:11:08.520 --> 1:11:11.200
more than once.

1:11:11.240 --> 1:11:13.200
But to think that
it was all done

1:11:13.240 --> 1:11:17.280
by punching holes in cards
and running them

1:11:17.320 --> 1:11:21.920
through the Bell Labs computer
is quite astonishing.

[Upbeat, alternating electronic

1:11:36.320 --> 1:11:38.840
- [Laurie]: Technology
is just,

1:11:38.880 --> 1:11:40.600
it's a natural
extension of man.

1:11:40.640 --> 1:11:42.600
Man has always
played with tools.

1:11:42.640 --> 1:11:43.480
Man has always
developed tools,

1:11:43.520 --> 1:11:46.080

The machine doesn't
write the music.

1:11:48.400 --> 1:11:50.080
You tell the machine
what to do,

1:11:50.120 --> 1:11:52.080
and the machine is an

Everything changed after the
AT&T divestiture happened.

1:12:05.640 --> 1:12:07.560
Bell Labs became
product-oriented

1:12:07.600 --> 1:12:09.240
instead of pure research.

1:12:09.280 --> 1:12:13.320
[Faint phone conversations
and dialing]

1:12:13.360 --> 1:12:16.280
After I left there,
I was absolutely desolate.

1:12:16.320 --> 1:12:23.160
I had lost my main
creative medium.

1:12:23.200 --> 1:12:24.840
- [Male Interviewer]:
Laurie Spiegel,

1:12:24.880 --> 1:12:27.240
you have a very
fascinating new product,

1:12:27.280 --> 1:12:29.160
a software program,
which you created...

1:12:29.200 --> 1:12:31.160
- Yeah.
- ...called Music Mouse.

1:12:31.200 --> 1:12:32.880
Can you tell us a little
bit about that?

1:12:33.120 --> 1:12:36.000
- This is actually a program
which turns the Macintosh

1:12:36.040 --> 1:12:38.000
into an instrument
which you play,

1:12:38.040 --> 1:12:41.960
and unlike traditional
instruments,

1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:44.160
on the other hand,
it uses the logic

1:12:44.200 --> 1:12:48.240
of the computer supportively
to musical expression.

1:12:48.280 --> 1:12:50.720
[Uplifting piano music]

1:12:50.760 --> 1:12:55.240
[Melody rises and falls
with the horizontal line]

1:12:55.280 --> 1:12:57.800
[Piano chords follow
the vertical lines]

1:12:57.840 --> 1:12:59.440
I needed an instrument.

1:12:59.480 --> 1:13:02.520
I wanted something which was
entirely under my own control

1:13:02.560 --> 1:13:04.200
that didn't have
to be marketable

1:13:04.240 --> 1:13:06.160
or it didn't involve funding.

1:13:06.200 --> 1:13:08.800
It was just something
entirely mine.

1:13:08.840 --> 1:13:14.800
[Melody and chords ascend]

1:13:14.880 --> 1:13:16.040
It's the first time
I've done something

1:13:16.080 --> 1:13:17.040
essentially for myself

1:13:17.080 --> 1:13:18.240
that I'm just really
making available

1:13:18.280 --> 1:13:19.320
to anybody who wants it,

1:13:19.360 --> 1:13:21.200
and I hope a lot
of people really get

1:13:21.240 --> 1:13:22.320
a lot of good
music out of it.

1:13:22.360 --> 1:13:24.720
Everybody who's using it
seems to be doing

1:13:24.760 --> 1:13:25.680
something slightly different.

1:13:25.720 --> 1:13:27.040
So I'll be interested,
you know,

1:13:27.080 --> 1:13:29.680
keeping my ears open
for whatever you do.

1:13:29.720 --> 1:13:31.040
Mouse ears.

1:13:31.080 --> 1:13:34.720
[Chords ascend then
rapidly descend]

1:13:34.760 --> 1:13:37.080
[Sustained notes form a
warm blanket of sound]

1:13:37.120 --> 1:13:40.280
[A new piece begins with
dissonant, moving notes]

1:13:40.320 --> 1:13:41.760
- She wasn't satisfied with

1:13:41.800 --> 1:13:44.200
the given constraints of
what she was working with.

1:13:44.240 --> 1:13:46.680
So she decided to make
her own software.

1:13:46.720 --> 1:13:50.760
She just embodies
this idea of agency.

1:13:50.800 --> 1:13:52.280
[The piece continues]

1:13:52.320 --> 1:13:56.440
[Each note has both lower tone
and a higher, harsh tone]

1:13:56.480 --> 1:13:59.160
- Her work was very
much in the lineage

1:13:59.200 --> 1:14:00.320
with the work of Daphne Oram

1:14:00.360 --> 1:14:02.840
because of her engineering

1:14:02.880 --> 1:14:06.240
of a new language
for producing sounds,

1:14:06.280 --> 1:14:08.360
and the support system
for other people

1:14:08.400 --> 1:14:10.360
to invent new soundscapes.

1:14:10.400 --> 1:14:16.200
[Irregular melody]

1:14:16.240 --> 1:14:18.000
- [Female Interviewer]: What's
the most exciting thing

1:14:18.040 --> 1:14:20.360
about the field for you?

1:14:20.400 --> 1:14:25.760
- Well, this is a time at
which many people feel

1:14:25.800 --> 1:14:29.080
that there are a lot of
dead ends in music,

1:14:29.120 --> 1:14:30.240
that there isn't
a lot more to do.

1:14:30.280 --> 1:14:31.040
This is actually...

1:14:31.080 --> 1:14:34.040
I see this and through
the technology,

1:14:34.080 --> 1:14:36.240
I experience this as
quite the opposite.

1:14:36.280 --> 1:14:40.800
This is a period in which we
realise we've only just begun

1:14:40.840 --> 1:14:44.320
to scratch the surface of
what's possible musically.

1:14:44.360 --> 1:14:51.280
[Energetic, alternating,
percussive tones]

1:14:51.320 --> 1:14:52.760
- [Female Narrator]:
Through technology,

1:14:52.800 --> 1:14:57.280
voices are amplified,
silence is broken,

1:14:57.320 --> 1:14:59.840
spaces are shared.

1:14:59.880 --> 1:15:02.280
The music in our head

1:15:02.320 --> 1:15:05.920
can finally be
heard by others.

1:15:05.960 --> 1:15:11.240
[Pigeons cooing]

1:15:11.280 --> 1:15:21.520

1:15:21.560 --> 1:15:27.200
[Wings flapping]

1:15:27.240 --> 1:15:29.160
- [Laurie]: We
were, in a way,

1:15:29.200 --> 1:15:31.480
trying to make a
bit of a revolution,

1:15:31.520 --> 1:15:33.280
but I don't think we
would have put it

1:15:33.320 --> 1:15:34.240
in such grandiose terms.

1:15:34.280 --> 1:15:39.040
We were trying to put music
back in touch with itself.

1:15:40.320 --> 1:15:45.240
[Relaxed, low-pitched
electronic groove]

1:15:45.280 --> 1:15:49.240
[Buttons clicking]

1:15:49.280 --> 1:15:52.520
- [Suzanne whispering]: Okay,
and this has to go here.

1:15:52.560 --> 1:15:53.840
This is here.

1:15:53.880 --> 1:15:55.280
This is...

1:15:59.240 --> 1:16:06.320
[Buttons clicking rapidly]

1:16:06.360 --> 1:16:13.760
[Robotic beeping]

1:16:13.800 --> 1:16:18.440
There were really no role
models for female composers

1:16:18.480 --> 1:16:21.920
when I studied music.

1:16:21.960 --> 1:16:26.520
Overall, we are incrementally
getting more visibility,

1:16:26.560 --> 1:16:30.320
but it's two steps forward
and one step back.

1:16:32.200 --> 1:16:34.520
And to this day
it kind of irks me

1:16:34.560 --> 1:16:38.040
that when I turn on my
favorite radio station,

1:16:38.080 --> 1:16:40.680
it's just the male parade.

1:16:40.720 --> 1:16:45.200
[Low tones move over an
orchestra of electronic sounds]

1:16:45.240 --> 1:16:51.920
[Sounds get choppier,
resembling radio tuning]

1:16:51.960 --> 1:16:55.360
[Low drone with
a sustained pitch]

1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:59.320
- [Laurie]: It is odd that
electronic music,

1:16:59.360 --> 1:17:03.920
it's generally considered
a man's field.

1:17:03.960 --> 1:17:08.200
Women have been
so formative in it.

1:17:08.240 --> 1:17:17.960
[Low drone continues]

1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:18.840
- [Pauline]: There has to be

1:17:18.880 --> 1:17:20.160
a complete change of
consciousness

1:17:20.200 --> 1:17:23.200
throughout the
musical field,

1:17:23.240 --> 1:17:25.480
where they could begin to
teach music that's written

1:17:25.520 --> 1:17:30.800
by women, as well as men,
as well as of all colours,

1:17:30.840 --> 1:17:36.320
and it would effect
a great change.

1:17:36.360 --> 1:17:40.080
Listening is the basis of
creativity and culture.

1:17:40.120 --> 1:17:45.800
How you're listening is and
how you develop a culture.

1:17:45.840 --> 1:17:48.760
And how a community
of people listen

1:17:48.800 --> 1:17:52.160
is what creates
their culture.

1:17:52.200 --> 1:18:17.080
[Overtones layer over
the low drone]

1:18:17.120 --> 1:18:19.120
[Eliane speaking French]

1:18:28.640 --> 1:18:35.720
[Overtones swell over
the low drone]

1:19:16.600 --> 1:19:26.200
[Drone continues]

1:19:26.240 --> 1:19:28.040
- It's quite reassuring
to realise that

1:19:28.080 --> 1:19:33.240
I wasn't the only woman making
strange electronic music.

1:19:33.280 --> 1:19:35.360
- What relates
all of these women

1:19:35.400 --> 1:19:38.080
is this DIY thing.

1:19:38.120 --> 1:19:40.280
And DIY is interesting
because it doesn't mean that

1:19:40.320 --> 1:19:44.320
you've explicitly, voluntarily
chosen to do it yourself.

1:19:44.360 --> 1:19:46.680
It's that there are
certain barriers in place

1:19:46.720 --> 1:19:52.280
that don't allow
you to do anything.

1:19:52.320 --> 1:19:56.280
If you don't have the visual
or the knowledge

1:19:56.320 --> 1:20:01.000
of there being any people
in the area of work

1:20:01.040 --> 1:20:03.160
that you're interested in
that are similar to you,

1:20:03.200 --> 1:20:07.240
then you don't think
that it's possible for you.

1:20:07.280 --> 1:20:10.040
[Low drone swells slightly]

1:20:10.080 --> 1:20:12.200
- There is something
psychological

1:20:12.240 --> 1:20:15.320
that happens when you can
see yourself in the people

1:20:15.360 --> 1:20:17.200
who are being celebrated.

1:20:17.240 --> 1:20:18.320
