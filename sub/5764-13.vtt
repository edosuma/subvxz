WEBVTT

00:04.035 --> 00:05.636
Sure, I can cover your patient, too,

00:05.704 --> 00:06.837
But, um, there she is.

00:06.905 --> 00:08.872
Hey. Hi.

00:09.940 --> 00:12.679
Look, first thing, I love you.

00:12.747 --> 00:14.566
Well, that's good.

00:14.651 --> 00:15.999
But this is going to be the third
time this week that I do this.

00:16.065 --> 00:17.888
No! I know, I'm sorry.

00:17.955 --> 00:19.096
But half the staff's got the flu,

00:19.163 --> 00:20.700
Half's got some sort of respiratory virus.

00:20.768 --> 00:21.700
I just can't get out of here.

00:21.768 --> 00:22.705
Not even for lunch?

00:22.773 --> 00:23.907
We can go to the cafeteria.

00:23.974 --> 00:24.906
But I gotta work a double.

00:24.974 --> 00:26.141
Is this even safe?

00:26.209 --> 00:27.644
I mean, I don't understand

00:27.711 --> 00:29.211
The medical profession,
and I feel like doctors

00:29.279 --> 00:30.579
And truck drivers-- truck drivers?

00:30.646 --> 00:32.412
And pilots, you know,
they should get the most sleep,

00:32.479 --> 00:33.844
You know, not the least.

00:35.912 --> 00:38.680
Well, we got vegetarian lasagna today, ehhh.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.682
Help.

00:40.750 --> 00:42.184
Somebody help me.

00:42.252 --> 00:43.653
Hey, what's the problem?

00:43.721 --> 00:45.387
Sir, did something happen to you?

00:45.455 --> 00:46.787
He had a knife.
Why aren't you listening to me?

00:46.855 --> 00:48.887
Lock the door. Lock the door.
Just lock the door.

00:48.955 --> 00:50.255
Call the police.
You should definitely do that.

00:52.224 --> 00:53.324
Sir, we need to examine you.

00:53.392 --> 00:54.526
Yeah, let's do that right now.

00:54.594 --> 00:56.027
Ok, why don't we examine you.

00:56.095 --> 00:57.195
Just sit down. Help me get him to a chair.

00:57.263 --> 00:58.496
He had a knife. He had a knife. Whoa!

00:58.564 --> 00:59.497
He won't stop slashing!

00:59.565 --> 01:01.098
He just kept slashing!

01:03.902 --> 01:05.771
Let go of her. He won't stop slashing!

01:05.838 --> 01:07.069
He just kept slashing.
Can we get security down here?

01:07.136 --> 01:08.834
His eyes, his eyes!

01:08.902 --> 01:10.369
Are you gonna be all right?

01:10.437 --> 01:11.704
It's going to be fine, sir. Calm down.

01:11.772 --> 01:12.705
Where is security? And the blood!

01:12.773 --> 01:14.174
And the blood, you have to stop him!

01:14.242 --> 01:16.976
There was an officer in peed's
talking with a social worker.

01:17.044 --> 01:19.078
Call over there.
Just get someone who is armed.

01:19.145 --> 01:20.312
Won't do any good.

01:20.380 --> 01:22.080
They can't stop it.

01:22.148 --> 01:24.114
Stop it? Do you know what happened to him?

01:24.182 --> 01:26.149
They can't save him no matter what they do.

01:26.217 --> 01:28.384
He's a dead man.

01:33.122 --> 01:35.156
Child, whispering: Can you see us?

02:09.594 --> 02:10.561
Hey. Why aren't you listening to me?!

02:10.627 --> 02:11.761
Please, someone just listen to me!

02:11.828 --> 02:12.862
How is he? I don't know.

02:12.929 --> 02:14.530
The er doctor took over.

02:14.597 --> 02:15.798
They want to sedate him,
but they say he's got to talk to police.

02:15.865 --> 02:17.132
Ok, well, you should talk to him first,

02:17.200 --> 02:18.199
Or get me in there.

02:18.267 --> 02:19.434
Wait, did you see something?

02:19.501 --> 02:22.069
Something and someone. I had a vision.

02:22.137 --> 02:23.337
I saw someone with a knife.

02:23.404 --> 02:24.704
Just like he said.

02:24.772 --> 02:26.839
Except it was a woman.
She was screaming and bleeding.

02:26.907 --> 02:28.874
Do you think someone else was attacked?

02:28.942 --> 02:30.275
Did he say anything about a woman?

02:30.343 --> 02:32.144
No, but, I mean, he's in shock.

02:32.211 --> 02:34.379
Oh, boy. Right this way, officers.

02:34.447 --> 02:35.847
He said someone is after him.
The patient's this way.

02:35.914 --> 02:37.214
Did you see the person holding the knife?

02:37.282 --> 02:38.782
I think it was a man.

02:38.850 --> 02:39.883
Do you think you could describe

02:39.950 --> 02:41.084
The woman in the vision to the police?

02:41.151 --> 02:43.152
Dirty blond hair,
an intense cut on her forearm.

02:43.220 --> 02:44.286
I don't even know if she's still alive.

02:44.354 --> 02:45.521
All right, that's the something you saw.

02:45.588 --> 02:47.188
What about the someone? Ghost.

02:47.256 --> 02:48.790
In his thirties.
It was kind of hard to make out.

02:48.857 --> 02:50.258
But he wasn't cut, he wasn't bleeding,

02:50.326 --> 02:51.293
He just looked awful.

02:51.360 --> 02:52.660
What is he, a third victim?

02:52.728 --> 02:54.428
Or the attacker.
Maybe someone that the guy--

02:54.496 --> 02:55.862
Robert, his name's robert.

02:55.930 --> 02:58.031
Ok, maybe somebody that
robert killed in a struggle.

02:58.099 --> 02:59.432
Wait, he didn't even know it?

02:59.500 --> 03:01.034
I mean, like, he was being
chased and didn't know?

03:01.101 --> 03:03.069
All I know is that the ghost said
there's nothing anyone could do.

03:03.137 --> 03:05.671
And that your patient
robert is going to die.

03:06.973 --> 03:08.040
Is he?

03:08.107 --> 03:09.241
I don't know. It's tough to tell.

03:09.308 --> 03:10.575
With a knife wound,

03:10.643 --> 03:12.377
Sometimes you gotta open
them up and see the damage.

03:12.445 --> 03:13.611
Ok, well, you need to get to him
before he gets into surgery.

03:13.679 --> 03:15.180
That woman could still be out there.

03:15.247 --> 03:16.848
Yeah, and she might still
be alive, right? Ok.

03:26.887 --> 03:29.388
So he's stable. I'll notify the e.R.

03:29.456 --> 03:32.656
Good. I'll be back, dr. Myers.

03:32.724 --> 03:35.024
Hey, wesley.

03:35.092 --> 03:36.192
What's going on in there?

03:36.259 --> 03:37.893
Dr. Meyers is just finishing up the exam.

03:37.961 --> 03:38.928
He's gonna be fine.

03:38.996 --> 03:40.729
They're not going to open him up?

03:40.797 --> 03:41.730
No, we checked him out.

03:41.798 --> 03:42.931
He's got lots of abrasions

03:42.999 --> 03:44.632
And some moderate lacerations.

03:44.700 --> 03:46.400
Nothing that looks like a knife wound.

03:46.468 --> 03:47.635
What about all that blood he came in with?

03:47.702 --> 03:50.004
Well, like I said, he's pretty banged up.

03:50.071 --> 03:52.005
Anybody know why?

03:52.073 --> 03:54.341
He keeps talking about
some guy with a knife.

03:54.409 --> 03:57.777
Maybe he got knocked around
pretty good trying to get away.

03:57.845 --> 03:59.779
I really need to talk to him.

03:59.847 --> 04:02.948
Those cops are waiting to
talk to him, too, you know.

04:03.016 --> 04:05.884
Yeah.

04:07.152 --> 04:08.719
I need to talk to him first,

04:08.787 --> 04:12.088
So could you hold them
off for about 5 minutes?

04:12.156 --> 04:13.389
You got it. Thanks.

04:19.728 --> 04:22.396
Hey, mr. Wharton, how are you doing?

04:23.699 --> 04:25.900
Who are you?

04:25.967 --> 04:27.902
I'm a doctor. Well, actually I'm the guy

04:27.969 --> 04:29.603
Who threw you in the wheelchair
when you first came in here.

04:29.671 --> 04:31.471
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:31.539 --> 04:33.873
It's just, I'm so tired.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.974
It's probably the adrenaline.
You know, it spikes

04:36.042 --> 04:37.942
And then your body crashes.

04:38.009 --> 04:39.576
They said there's nothing wrong with me.

04:39.644 --> 04:41.277
No, not too much. Nothing serious.

04:41.345 --> 04:46.015
Look, this attack you've
been talking about...

04:46.082 --> 04:47.516
Was there anyone else who got hurt?

04:47.583 --> 04:48.717
Anyone else?

04:48.784 --> 04:49.717
Someone who was with you.

04:49.785 --> 04:51.685
You know, a woman, maybe?

04:51.753 --> 04:53.720
Ah, I don't know.

04:53.788 --> 04:54.821
All right.

04:54.889 --> 04:56.389
Mr. Wharton?

04:58.025 --> 05:00.192
Do you mind if I call you robert?

05:00.260 --> 05:01.627
Look, robert,

05:01.694 --> 05:04.562
Someone saw a woman being
attacked with a knife.

05:04.630 --> 05:05.897
Where?

05:05.965 --> 05:07.198
Well, that's what I was
hoping you could tell me.

05:07.266 --> 05:11.202
You came in here,
you haven't been cut by a knife,

05:11.269 --> 05:13.303
But it turns out this woman was.

05:13.371 --> 05:15.939
It wasn't a dream.

05:16.007 --> 05:18.641
Wait, you know what I'm talking about?

05:18.709 --> 05:20.776
This actually happened?

05:20.844 --> 05:23.378
Robert... Who was she?

05:23.446 --> 05:26.380
Who was she?

05:26.447 --> 05:28.248
Can you tell me anything about this attack?

05:28.315 --> 05:29.581
Look, where did it happen? Were you inside?

05:29.649 --> 05:31.617
Were you outside, were you in a building?

05:31.684 --> 05:33.285
Tell me any sounds you heard, anything.

05:33.353 --> 05:36.388
The night was just so dark.

05:36.456 --> 05:39.291
I just wanted to shut my eyes.

05:39.358 --> 05:42.493
I thought, please,
could I just shut my eyes?

05:42.561 --> 05:44.328
Hey, man, it's the middle of the afternoon.

05:44.396 --> 05:46.063
This went on all night?

05:46.131 --> 05:47.331
I don't know.

05:47.399 --> 05:48.432
Who did this to you?

05:48.499 --> 05:50.066
What the hell happened to you?

05:50.134 --> 05:52.834
Robert, where were you before you came here?

05:54.036 --> 05:55.770
Where am I now?

05:55.837 --> 05:57.838
You're in the rockland memorial hospital.

05:57.905 --> 05:59.406
Who are you?

05:59.473 --> 06:00.773
My name's jim, I'm a doctor.

06:00.841 --> 06:02.641
You don't remember coming here, do you?

06:04.444 --> 06:05.477
I wake up in places,

06:05.544 --> 06:07.579
And I can't remember how I got there.

06:07.646 --> 06:09.948
Was I sleeping?

06:10.016 --> 06:13.318
Just now, was I sleeping?

06:13.386 --> 06:15.153
No, it's like you're blacking out.

06:15.221 --> 06:16.521
Yeah.

06:16.589 --> 06:19.290
I guess so.

06:19.358 --> 06:22.593
I think so.

06:22.660 --> 06:25.762
Robert, I'm going to ask you a
very important question, all right?

06:25.830 --> 06:28.664
You came in here covered with blood.

06:28.732 --> 06:30.166
Was that blood yours?

06:30.233 --> 06:32.034
I don't know.

06:32.102 --> 06:34.669
Robert, tell me. Did you hurt somebody?

06:34.737 --> 06:36.004
Somebody you knew, anybody?

06:36.071 --> 06:37.238
A woman? Did you?

06:37.306 --> 06:39.974
No, no, I wouldn't. I couldn't.

06:40.042 --> 06:43.210
I hope not.

06:45.179 --> 06:48.014
Am I awake?

06:48.082 --> 06:49.715
I mean, is this place real?

06:51.551 --> 06:54.419
Are you real?

07:00.791 --> 07:02.858
You see?

07:05.728 --> 07:07.462
It's in him now.

07:07.529 --> 07:10.364
It's in him now?

07:10.432 --> 07:11.364
What does that mean?

07:11.432 --> 07:12.798
Melinda wasn't exactly sure,

07:12.866 --> 07:14.166
And the ghost didn't
stick around to explain.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.233
Where is she?

07:15.301 --> 07:16.835
She's giving eli the local ghost update.

07:16.902 --> 07:18.336
What do I do?

07:18.404 --> 07:20.206
I want you to find out everything
you can about robert wharton.

07:20.274 --> 07:22.676
You mean, about people he knows who died.

07:22.744 --> 07:24.844
Yeah, but especially the one we hope didn't.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.145
The woman that she saw getting cut.

07:26.213 --> 07:27.947
Yeah. So look at his friends, ok?

07:28.015 --> 07:29.149
But don't rule anybody out.

07:29.217 --> 07:30.884
And see if anybody's gone
missing in grandview.

07:30.952 --> 07:33.320
If not, nearby towns, ok? I'm on it.

07:33.388 --> 07:34.521
Thanks, man.

07:34.589 --> 07:36.756
Hey, so is detective blair.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.524
She must have gotten melinda's message.

07:38.592 --> 07:39.858
All right, you hear anything, call me.

07:39.926 --> 07:40.859
Ok.

07:40.927 --> 07:43.328
Thanks, man. Take it easy.

07:43.396 --> 07:47.765
So you're sure that this is the man you saw?

07:47.833 --> 07:49.333
Yeah. That's the guy

07:49.401 --> 07:51.235
I saw sleeping on the bench.

07:51.303 --> 07:53.770
And you didn't see anyone with him,

07:53.838 --> 07:55.205
Near him, menacing him?

07:55.272 --> 07:57.974
No. But as he was curling up to go to sleep,

07:58.041 --> 08:00.175
I noticed he might be hurt.

08:00.243 --> 08:01.677
So I asked him if he was ok,

08:01.744 --> 08:04.779
And he looked at me like totally lost.

08:04.847 --> 08:06.414
And I pointed out the blood.

08:06.482 --> 08:08.949
That's when he ran away.

08:09.017 --> 08:10.417
When he realized you saw the blood.

08:10.485 --> 08:11.585
Yeah.

08:11.653 --> 08:14.121
Excuse me. Sorry, detective blair.

08:14.188 --> 08:15.688
But I was here when the guy

08:15.756 --> 08:17.123
You're talking about was brought in,

08:17.191 --> 08:19.158
And he told us he was being chased.

08:19.226 --> 08:21.860
Yeah, by someone with a knife.

08:21.927 --> 08:24.128
I didn't see anyone.

08:24.196 --> 08:27.498
And I'm telling you, the person
he was running from was me.

08:27.565 --> 08:28.565
And then what happened?

08:28.633 --> 08:30.400
I followed him. I lost him

08:30.468 --> 08:32.368
For a few minutes, but then I saw him

08:32.436 --> 08:34.937
Ducking into the hospital, and...

08:35.005 --> 08:38.607
Here I am.

08:40.241 --> 08:41.543
This guy walks into a hospital

08:41.610 --> 08:42.577
Screaming he's been attacked

08:42.644 --> 08:43.910
When he's the attacker?

08:43.979 --> 08:45.980
It's a possibility, that's all I'm saying.

08:46.047 --> 08:48.348
I've heard about throwing
suspicion onto someone else,

08:48.416 --> 08:50.250
But come on, be smart.

08:50.317 --> 08:53.852
Only do it after the police are onto you.

08:53.920 --> 08:57.322
Or this guy robert could have had
some kind of psychotic break.

08:57.390 --> 08:59.457
Yeah, and really believes
everything he's saying.

08:59.525 --> 09:00.858
I really don't think he
has any idea what he did.

09:00.926 --> 09:03.260
And, you know, we have no
idea what he's capable of.

09:03.328 --> 09:04.495
All right, well, can you check his records?

09:04.562 --> 09:06.630
Find out if he's under psychiatric care?

09:06.697 --> 09:07.864
Maybe he went off his meds.

09:07.932 --> 09:09.832
He had nothing on him. No wallet, nothing.

09:09.900 --> 09:11.534
Only information we have is
his name and his blood type.

09:11.601 --> 09:13.702
And the blood that was on his shirt,
they're testing it,

09:13.770 --> 09:15.437
So if there was a second type...

09:15.505 --> 09:17.172
Then he might have hurt someone else.

09:17.239 --> 09:18.940
The woman you saw. Or the ghost, right?

09:19.007 --> 09:22.076
I mean, there is one dead
person in this scenario?

09:22.143 --> 09:23.810
The ghost said you can't save him.

09:23.878 --> 09:26.346
Maybe he meant robert
should fry for what he did.

09:26.414 --> 09:29.582
But even if he killed both of them,
that's unlikely.

09:29.650 --> 09:32.051
So...Look, I'm not sure.

09:32.118 --> 09:34.586
But I don't think this
guy meant to hurt anyone.

09:34.654 --> 09:36.521
I mean, he seems like he wants to help.

09:36.589 --> 09:37.855
Good.

09:37.923 --> 09:40.224
'cause I want to talk to him.

09:40.292 --> 09:42.426
We sent officers over to
robert's place of employment

09:42.494 --> 09:43.593
And his apartment.

09:43.661 --> 09:45.095
He was fired weeks ago. What happened?

09:45.162 --> 09:46.329
Well, over the course
of the last few months,

09:46.397 --> 09:48.264
He became erratic and aggressive.

09:48.331 --> 09:49.998
Then he just stopped showing up for work.

09:50.066 --> 09:51.266
That'll get you canned.

09:51.334 --> 09:53.635
Did you find anything in his apartment?

09:53.702 --> 09:56.337
Yeah, I mean, did anyone
see him with a woman?

09:56.405 --> 09:57.671
A woman who he might have hurt?

09:57.739 --> 10:00.073
The neighbor said he had a
girlfriend, helen reeman.

10:00.141 --> 10:01.841
They lived separately,
but she stayed nights with him.

10:01.909 --> 10:03.343
She was him all the time.

10:03.410 --> 10:04.911
But no one has seen her in over a week,

10:04.978 --> 10:07.479
Including the people at her job.

10:07.547 --> 10:08.580
Yeah.

10:11.717 --> 10:13.084
I don't understand.

10:13.152 --> 10:15.653
If I'm not hurt, why am I still here?

10:15.720 --> 10:17.921
Yeah, well, we think you're still at risk.

10:17.989 --> 10:19.589
You said you've been blacking out, right?

10:19.657 --> 10:20.990
I guess, but I don't--

10:21.058 --> 10:22.525
Can't remember.

10:22.593 --> 10:24.527
We're just going to run some
tests and see if there's

10:24.594 --> 10:27.563
A medical reason for it. Or...Anything else.

10:27.630 --> 10:29.865
like I'm crazy?

10:29.933 --> 10:32.601
I mean, it's what you're thinking, isn't it?

10:32.668 --> 10:34.769
Do you think you are? Could that explain

10:34.837 --> 10:36.070
Some of the things you've done?

10:36.138 --> 10:37.605
What have I done?

10:39.274 --> 10:41.008
Who are you?

10:41.075 --> 10:43.009
Hi.

10:43.077 --> 10:46.279
Um, robert, this is my wife, melinda.

10:46.346 --> 10:47.680
Sometimes she does special counseling

10:47.747 --> 10:50.849
For certain patients.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.351
I don't know what's happening to me.

10:53.419 --> 10:55.019
Detective blair: What's happening
is your girlfriend is missing.

10:55.087 --> 10:56.220
Helen reeman.

10:56.288 --> 10:57.888
Do you know who we're talking about?

10:59.057 --> 11:00.691
Helen? Yeah.

11:00.759 --> 11:02.993
Of course.

11:03.061 --> 11:05.662
You came in here talking
about a man with a knife.

11:05.730 --> 11:07.630
The doctors think you may be delusional,

11:07.698 --> 11:10.600
But I just think you might be confused.

11:10.667 --> 11:14.003
And the man with the knife was you.
That sound right?

11:14.070 --> 11:15.937
Oh, my god.

11:16.005 --> 11:18.539
Helen.

11:18.607 --> 11:20.908
In my dream, I saw a knife,

11:20.976 --> 11:23.577
And it was slashing at someone.

11:23.645 --> 11:26.880
There was blood.

11:26.948 --> 11:29.615
I heard a woman screaming,

11:29.683 --> 11:31.317
Saying, "stop!

11:31.385 --> 11:34.886
Please stop, I'm begging you."

11:34.954 --> 11:36.888
Then she said she loved me.

11:36.956 --> 11:39.991
She was bleeding.

11:40.058 --> 11:44.428
Then it was just so quiet.

11:44.495 --> 11:46.929
Next thing I knew, I woke up
and I was covered in blood.

11:57.286 --> 11:59.453
He killed his girlfriend,
and he doesn't remember it?

11:59.521 --> 12:00.921
He must be out of his mind.

12:00.989 --> 12:02.288
Yeah. Or out of his body.

12:02.356 --> 12:03.556
Aiden! Hey.

12:03.624 --> 12:05.257
Here's your snack. How was school today?

12:05.325 --> 12:06.525
Good.

12:06.593 --> 12:07.726
Is there anything you want
to tell me about today?

12:07.794 --> 12:09.594
Maybe just one thing? Hmm, nothing.

12:09.662 --> 12:11.730
Can I eat next to my game? I'm playing.

12:11.797 --> 12:13.131
Sure.

12:14.766 --> 12:18.235
Andrew wong got a crayon stuck in his nose.

12:18.303 --> 12:20.070
Ooh. Is he ok?

12:20.138 --> 12:23.406
Yeah, he's fine. It was purple.

12:23.474 --> 12:24.807
Well, there you go.

12:26.276 --> 12:28.710
Honey, it sounds like
you got your hands full.

12:28.778 --> 12:29.945
The ghost, the murderer.

12:30.012 --> 12:32.580
The missing girlfriend we
still haven't found yet.

12:32.648 --> 12:35.916
And the demonic twin.
Tell her about that one.

12:35.984 --> 12:38.652
Yeah, he's not a twin.

12:38.720 --> 12:41.721
It was a vision, and it was that guy robert.

12:41.789 --> 12:44.223
The patient and maybe murderer?

12:44.291 --> 12:45.758
Yeah. He was holding a knife

12:45.826 --> 12:48.127
And had this very hollow expression.

12:48.194 --> 12:50.395
And goat's eyes. You know how goats

12:50.463 --> 12:52.230
Have the slit pupils that go sideways?

12:52.298 --> 12:54.031
Mm-hmm. They're satanic.

12:54.099 --> 12:58.534
Ah! How did satan get brought
up in this conversation?

12:58.602 --> 12:59.969
The ghost said it's in him now, right?

13:00.037 --> 13:01.671
Maybe what's in our patient

13:01.738 --> 13:03.172
Isn't some kind of psychosis.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.640
Yeah, or maybe he was just in shock,

13:04.707 --> 13:06.141
Or had some kind of brain tumor.

13:06.209 --> 13:09.343
I mean, the delusional state
that he shared with me...

13:09.411 --> 13:11.244
Or he's sick with something worse.

13:11.311 --> 13:13.512
Something evil.

13:13.579 --> 13:14.946
I don't buy it.

13:15.014 --> 13:17.081
'cause you don't believe
evil exists on its own.

13:17.148 --> 13:18.949
How do you explain the shadows?
The bad parts

13:19.016 --> 13:20.816
Of people left over when
they go into the light.

13:20.884 --> 13:22.751
Aiden's seen it. Ok, ned.

13:22.819 --> 13:24.686
Stop. I know this is what you're into,

13:24.753 --> 13:27.354
And I know you're studying the occult
because you're trying to help people--

13:27.422 --> 13:29.489
I'm studying it because
I find it fascinating.

13:29.556 --> 13:31.189
Because both of you

13:31.257 --> 13:33.324
Showed me there's more in this
world than what you can see.

13:33.391 --> 13:36.158
Why can't you trust what you saw?

13:36.226 --> 13:37.592
Because ghosts are unreliable.

13:37.660 --> 13:39.327
Look, I don't even know who this ghost is.

13:39.395 --> 13:41.995
Let's just start there. Ok, who's the ghost

13:42.063 --> 13:43.997
And how is it related to robert?

13:44.064 --> 13:45.898
Ok, fine.

13:45.966 --> 13:47.833
Robert isn't married.

13:47.901 --> 13:49.967
He has no children, and his mother is dead.

13:50.035 --> 13:51.135
What about his father?

13:51.202 --> 13:52.569
61, and alive.

13:52.636 --> 13:55.503
His name's rudy, and he works downtown.

13:55.571 --> 13:57.471
Maybe he knows your ghost. Yeah, thanks.

13:58.773 --> 14:01.342
Where is it? Oh.

14:01.410 --> 14:02.846
Hello?

14:02.914 --> 14:04.816
There's a jane doe in the morgue,

14:04.883 --> 14:07.153
And she's got lacerations on her arm.

14:08.857 --> 14:11.226
Maybe robert should identify her.

14:11.294 --> 14:13.529
It was his girlfriend.
I think he's just trying to help.

14:13.597 --> 14:15.933
They can't let him, it's police
procedure, he's a suspect.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.035
Besides, he's just dehydrated
and confused, exhausted.

14:19.103 --> 14:20.937
I can't believe he hasn't passed out yet.

14:21.004 --> 14:22.638
I can't believe I haven't, either.

14:22.706 --> 14:23.940
Yeah, what shift are you on?

14:24.007 --> 14:25.841
I can't remember.

14:27.444 --> 14:29.345
Why isn't robert passed out?

14:29.413 --> 14:30.713
That's a good question.

14:30.780 --> 14:32.814
Every time he tries to fall asleep,
or he's about to,

14:32.882 --> 14:34.982
He gets agitated.

14:35.050 --> 14:37.517
He goes in and out of being
confused, being himself.

14:37.585 --> 14:38.785
It's strange.

14:38.853 --> 14:42.121
So she either jumped off a
bridge or she was pushed.

14:42.189 --> 14:43.356
So if she died from a fall,

14:43.424 --> 14:44.857
Then why did the ghost
show me a knife wound?

14:44.925 --> 14:48.860
Maybe robert went after her
with a knife before he...

14:48.928 --> 14:50.094
Can I see her face?

14:50.162 --> 14:53.731
It wouldn't help. She's unrecognizable.

15:02.139 --> 15:03.406
Any of these wounds look familiar?

15:03.474 --> 15:05.741
I saw one cut, but not
enough to identify her.

15:05.809 --> 15:08.744
See anything else? Any visions?

15:08.811 --> 15:10.412
No.

15:10.479 --> 15:12.513
Her hair looks similar.

15:12.581 --> 15:14.315
Lighter, maybe.

15:15.717 --> 15:17.451
What's weird is if robert killed her,

15:17.518 --> 15:19.585
Then where's her ghost?

15:19.653 --> 15:21.487
I don't know.

15:21.554 --> 15:23.188
Maybe she forgave him and crossed over

15:23.256 --> 15:24.656
Because he wasn't himself.

15:24.724 --> 15:27.625
A few months ago, this guy
had a girlfriend and a job.

15:27.693 --> 15:28.960
And then he just loses his mind,

15:29.027 --> 15:31.362
Starts blacking out and he kills her?

15:31.430 --> 15:34.064
She wouldn't go out like that.
She'd be worried about people.

15:34.132 --> 15:35.531
Maybe even robert. Yeah.

15:35.599 --> 15:36.932
Hey, I'll be out in a second.

15:44.039 --> 15:45.706
You can see me.

15:45.774 --> 15:46.941
Who are you?

15:47.008 --> 15:48.776
He's not dangerous.

15:48.844 --> 15:50.912
Robert? Are you his girlfriend?

15:50.980 --> 15:52.313
He wanted to be with her forever.

15:52.381 --> 15:53.547
He didn't want to hurt her.

15:53.615 --> 15:55.482
Hurt her?

15:59.853 --> 16:02.388
Is that you in there?

16:02.455 --> 16:05.423
Or are you just someone else
that he hurt and didn't mean to?

16:05.491 --> 16:07.592
I'm still tired. Isn't that strange?

16:07.659 --> 16:10.027
Other spirits say they can't feel anything,

16:10.095 --> 16:11.295
But they're wrong.

16:11.363 --> 16:13.463
'cause I can see how sad or lonely they are.

16:13.531 --> 16:15.398
And they still love just as much.

16:16.733 --> 16:18.434
I want to help you.

16:18.501 --> 16:20.068
Really, I do.

16:20.136 --> 16:21.570
114.

16:21.637 --> 16:24.772
114, don't go in 114.

16:24.840 --> 16:26.240
Is that an address?

16:26.308 --> 16:27.775
Is that where you died?

16:27.843 --> 16:29.743
You know, just talk to me.

16:29.811 --> 16:31.645
Do you know robert?

16:31.712 --> 16:35.281
Can you stop him from hurting anyone else?

16:35.348 --> 16:37.015
He won't hurt anyone else.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.450
He's going to die.

16:38.518 --> 16:39.985
There's nothing anyone can do about it.

16:40.052 --> 16:42.987
Wait, another spirit said
exactly that same thing. A man.

16:43.055 --> 16:44.655
Do you know him?

16:46.791 --> 16:48.825
You can see me.

16:48.893 --> 16:51.861
He's not dangerous.
He wanted to be with her forever.

16:51.929 --> 16:54.029
He didn't mean to hurt her.

16:54.097 --> 16:55.831
Right.

16:55.899 --> 16:57.266
114.

16:57.334 --> 16:59.301
114.

16:59.369 --> 17:02.070
1...14.

17:07.209 --> 17:09.344
How do you know that ghost even

17:09.411 --> 17:10.778
Knows our ghost? Or our guy?

17:10.846 --> 17:12.680
I don't even know if our
ghost knows our guy,

17:12.748 --> 17:14.048
Much less that ghost.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.648
Is it me, or does it sound like

17:15.717 --> 17:17.050
We're rapping about a bunch of nut bags?

17:17.117 --> 17:18.519
All these people,

17:18.586 --> 17:20.387
And when I say "people,
" I'm including the dead,

17:20.454 --> 17:22.387
Sound totally whackadoodle.

17:22.454 --> 17:24.056
Yeah, I've dealt with crazy ghosts before,

17:24.123 --> 17:25.624
But this one's different.

17:25.692 --> 17:27.159
What makes you so sure?

17:27.227 --> 17:28.727
It all happened so suddenly with robert.

17:28.795 --> 17:30.662
The living nut. Right. A few weeks ago,

17:30.730 --> 17:31.964
He was totally normal.

17:32.031 --> 17:34.732
And then all of a sudden,
he becomes violently insane.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.233
Define "normal."

17:36.300 --> 17:37.400
I mean, you said yourself,

17:37.467 --> 17:38.399
The ghost's girlfriend was totally nutty.

17:38.467 --> 17:40.867
I never said it was his girlfriend.

17:40.935 --> 17:42.669
Hey, guys. Hey.

17:42.736 --> 17:44.136
What's going on?

17:44.204 --> 17:45.604
Well, robert's being scheduled for an mri,

17:45.672 --> 17:47.472
And we're going to check for
any kind of brain abnormality.

17:47.540 --> 17:50.375
Till then, he's being
transferred to the psych ward.

17:50.443 --> 17:51.409
I can keep an eye on him there.

17:51.477 --> 17:53.078
Or you could talk to his father.

17:53.145 --> 17:55.313
That was my next step. He's here.

17:55.380 --> 17:56.580
He's signing commitment forms.

17:56.648 --> 17:58.882
And, uh, he's not alone.

17:58.950 --> 18:00.883
I was so worried about him.

18:00.951 --> 18:02.451
That's robert's father,

18:02.519 --> 18:04.819
And robert's girlfriend helen reeman.

18:04.887 --> 18:06.821
Are you sure? Yeah. I met her.

18:06.889 --> 18:08.722
They came in together.
They're both pretty broken up.

18:08.790 --> 18:10.590
Was she injured?

18:10.658 --> 18:12.926
No. She said he wasn't violent.

18:12.994 --> 18:14.094
She said he was agitated,

18:14.161 --> 18:15.795
But then he just shut himself off.

18:15.862 --> 18:17.930
She swears he never hurt her.

18:17.998 --> 18:19.731
So why couldn't we find her?

18:19.799 --> 18:21.133
Where has she been?

18:21.200 --> 18:23.768
Ah, looking for robert.

18:23.836 --> 18:26.570
You know, he stopped returning phone calls,
and then about a week ago,

18:26.638 --> 18:28.005
He's gone.

18:28.073 --> 18:29.606
They had met in providence,

18:29.674 --> 18:30.674
So that's where she was.

18:30.742 --> 18:31.841
She was checking out old haunts,

18:31.909 --> 18:33.276
Talking to his friends.

18:33.344 --> 18:34.444
While he and his devil buddy
were roaming grandview

18:34.511 --> 18:35.445
Getting bloody.

18:35.512 --> 18:37.713
Look, I'm glad that she's alive,

18:37.781 --> 18:38.914
But...

18:38.982 --> 18:40.382
Is she's not the knife victim, then who is?

18:40.450 --> 18:42.484
You know what, I don't think there was one.

18:42.551 --> 18:44.185
The bloodwork came back on his clothes,

18:44.253 --> 18:46.954
And there was only one type on it--his.

18:47.022 --> 18:49.256
And there was this witness,
the skateboarder kid.

18:49.324 --> 18:51.024
He said he saw a guy completely disoriented

18:51.092 --> 18:53.226
Falling down, totally agitated.

18:53.293 --> 18:54.793
Which would account for the blood,

18:54.861 --> 18:55.961
But what about the woman?

18:56.029 --> 18:57.295
And why was he running in the first place?

18:57.363 --> 19:00.632
If he's in that state,
could he maybe see a ghost?

19:00.699 --> 19:03.634
Well, let's not forget mrs.
Loopy down in the morgue.

19:03.702 --> 19:05.736
Why are they both predicting his doom?

19:05.804 --> 19:07.637
My guess is that mri's

19:07.705 --> 19:09.372
Going to come back with a big,
honking death sentence.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.875
Are the results in? Could it be a tumor?

19:11.942 --> 19:13.142
He hasn't even been scanned yet.

19:13.210 --> 19:14.777
You talked to his dad.

19:14.844 --> 19:16.945
Is there any history of
mental illness in his family?

19:17.013 --> 19:18.480
It's a dead end. Robert was adopted.

19:18.547 --> 19:19.948
Nobody knows anything
about his birth parents.

19:20.015 --> 19:21.783
So much for getting the
skinny from his family.

19:21.850 --> 19:23.618
I'm not so sure about that.

19:23.685 --> 19:25.419
The ghost said that we couldn't save him.

19:25.487 --> 19:26.820
Maybe it wasn't a threat.

19:26.888 --> 19:28.822
Maybe he was worried about him.

19:47.705 --> 19:49.939
You're his father, aren't you?

19:50.007 --> 19:51.441
Yes.

19:51.508 --> 19:53.342
I wasn't there for him.

19:55.879 --> 19:57.779
He needs me now.

20:17.064 --> 20:18.131
You said the ghost was close to the guy?

20:18.298 --> 20:19.532
Their foreheads were touching.

20:19.599 --> 20:21.500
And jim said that the patient
had the same nightmare,

20:21.568 --> 20:23.468
Of someone slashing a woman with a knife.

20:23.536 --> 20:25.103
That sounds about right.

20:25.171 --> 20:26.405
It sounds about right for what?

20:26.472 --> 20:27.673
They call it threading.

20:27.740 --> 20:29.441
I found 3 different references
to it in the library.

20:29.508 --> 20:30.976
Why is it called threading?

20:31.043 --> 20:32.644
It's when a ghost weaves images or visions

20:32.712 --> 20:34.312
Into the mind of a civilian.

20:34.380 --> 20:35.680
A civilian?

20:35.748 --> 20:37.549
Someone who's not a sensitive,
like you or aiden.

20:37.616 --> 20:39.817
It's supposed to be easier
with physical proximity.

20:39.885 --> 20:41.452
How easy?

20:41.520 --> 20:43.454
Well, you don't have to suppress
a person's consciousness,

20:43.522 --> 20:44.656
Like with possession,

20:44.723 --> 20:46.190
But it does take lots of energy;

20:46.258 --> 20:48.059
The kind of energy you
need major motion to get--

20:48.126 --> 20:50.027
Hate, anger, love.

20:50.095 --> 20:51.829
Or guilt.

20:51.896 --> 20:53.830
Well, that depends. How much guilt?

20:53.898 --> 20:56.500
Well, in my vision, it was from
the point of view of the slasher.

20:56.568 --> 20:59.402
If I had slashed someone,
I'd feel pretty guilty.

20:59.470 --> 21:00.834
Then again, I'm not a slasher.

21:00.902 --> 21:02.234
Maybe the ghost wasn't, either.

21:02.302 --> 21:04.133
Which begs the question--

21:04.201 --> 21:06.133
Why did he say, "he needs me."

21:06.200 --> 21:08.701
Why would he need his son
to see him slashing someone?

21:08.769 --> 21:10.636
And who was he slashing? I don't know.

21:10.704 --> 21:12.037
It wasn't robert's girlfriend.
I don't think it was

21:12.105 --> 21:13.372
The ghost I saw outside the morgue.

21:13.440 --> 21:14.506
Why?

21:14.574 --> 21:15.740
'cause she wasn't cut or bloody.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.108
And you know what,
it was something else she said.

21:17.175 --> 21:19.143
She said, "he didn't mean to hurt her,"

21:19.210 --> 21:21.144
Not, "he didn't mean to hurt me."

21:21.212 --> 21:22.912
Then who's the victim? Yeah.

21:22.980 --> 21:24.947
Who's the woman outside the morgue?

21:25.015 --> 21:26.916
Why are so many of them crazy?

21:28.551 --> 21:30.453
No, I don't mind you asking at all.

21:30.520 --> 21:32.788
Frankly, I wish the hospital
had sent someone sooner.

21:32.855 --> 21:34.823
I know they're busy, but, you know.

21:34.891 --> 21:38.426
God forbid you have an issue that doesn't
fit into one of their neat little boxes.

21:38.494 --> 21:40.394
Like robert?

21:40.462 --> 21:42.062
Yeah.

21:42.130 --> 21:43.764
Here.

21:43.832 --> 21:45.399
Have a seat.

21:45.467 --> 21:48.402
Although, to be honest,

21:48.469 --> 21:51.270
I'm probably more mad at myself.

21:51.338 --> 21:53.004
For what? Well, I never asked

21:53.072 --> 21:56.105
The tough questions until my son started...

21:56.173 --> 21:59.908
Till things went so wrong with him.

21:59.976 --> 22:02.310
Do you mind describing what happened to him?

22:02.378 --> 22:04.578
Well, first it was simple insomnia.

22:04.646 --> 22:06.647
It started a few months ago.

22:06.714 --> 22:07.847
He couldn't sleep.

22:07.915 --> 22:09.348
Nothing would help.

22:09.416 --> 22:12.218
You know, exercise, pills, warm milk.

22:12.285 --> 22:13.452
Nothing.

22:13.520 --> 22:15.153
And then the nightmares started.

22:15.221 --> 22:16.821
I heard it in his voice.

22:16.889 --> 22:18.423
We'd talk all the time.

22:18.490 --> 22:20.391
He was different.

22:20.459 --> 22:21.592
And it affected his work.

22:21.660 --> 22:22.826
Pretty soon, he lost his job.

22:22.894 --> 22:25.995
He started to wander off,
disappearing from home.

22:26.063 --> 22:28.164
Like he did when he
showed up at the hospital.

22:28.232 --> 22:29.666
Helen, his girlfriend, she left her own job

22:29.733 --> 22:31.833
To try and help, but it was no use.

22:31.901 --> 22:33.602
The longer he went without sleep,

22:33.669 --> 22:34.936
The worse it got.

22:35.004 --> 22:37.004
You said you didn't ask the tough questions.

22:37.072 --> 22:39.706
What questions were those?

22:39.773 --> 22:41.307
I don't know if you have your own kids,

22:41.375 --> 22:43.074
Biologically, I mean.

22:43.142 --> 22:44.342
None that I know of.

22:44.410 --> 22:46.010
Anyway, I have to imagine

22:46.077 --> 22:47.611
It's different when you have your own.

22:47.679 --> 22:50.781
You never worry someone will
come along and lay claim to him.

22:50.849 --> 22:52.349
Was the adoption problematic?

22:52.417 --> 22:54.918
No, I don't mean, you know, literal claim.

22:54.986 --> 22:57.720
I mean, what if your child

22:57.788 --> 23:00.323
Decides he wants to connect
with his own people?

23:00.391 --> 23:01.924
And, you know, what if he discovers

23:01.992 --> 23:03.659
He has more in common
with them than with you?

23:03.727 --> 23:05.461
You were afraid of losing him.

23:05.529 --> 23:07.262
So when we adopted,

23:07.330 --> 23:09.431
They asked if we wanted to know

23:09.498 --> 23:11.265
Robert's family's circumstances.

23:11.333 --> 23:13.368
And I said, no, no, I didn't want to know.

23:13.436 --> 23:15.337
That all changed when he got sick.

23:15.404 --> 23:16.638
Of course, and I had to know.

23:16.705 --> 23:17.705
I wish I'd known sooner.

23:17.772 --> 23:19.206
Known what?

23:19.273 --> 23:20.806
Robert's parents didn't
choose to give him up.

23:20.874 --> 23:23.142
It wasn't up to them.

23:23.210 --> 23:25.711
He was a ward of the state.

23:25.778 --> 23:29.748
Was this, by any chance, because
robert's father had killed his mother?

23:29.815 --> 23:31.550
How did you know that?

23:31.618 --> 23:33.285
It's hard to explain, but I promise I will.

23:33.352 --> 23:35.753
Do you have any paperwork I can see?

23:38.056 --> 23:39.858
I understand that there are privacy issues,

23:39.926 --> 23:42.127
But I was hoping you'd still
want to help the family.

23:42.195 --> 23:44.929
You're forgetting that I'm retired now.

23:44.997 --> 23:47.064
Especially considering
the gaps in your report.

23:47.132 --> 23:48.465
What gaps?

23:48.533 --> 23:49.933
Robert's adopted father is how I found you.

23:50.001 --> 23:50.967
You were the social worker on the case.

23:51.035 --> 23:52.635
Yeah.

23:52.703 --> 23:55.704
Well, you left his birth
father's cause of death blank.

23:55.772 --> 23:57.939
But then you said it was
listed in appendix d,

23:58.007 --> 23:59.341
But there is no appendix d.

23:59.409 --> 24:01.143
So maybe it fell out of the file.

24:01.211 --> 24:03.979
That's when I realized that the
pages prove that nothing's missing.

24:04.047 --> 24:05.846
See, appendix c is on page 13

24:05.914 --> 24:07.348
And appendix e is on page 14,

24:07.416 --> 24:10.317
Meaning that there was never an appendix d.

24:10.385 --> 24:11.618
Was there?

24:12.753 --> 24:14.887
What do you want?

24:14.955 --> 24:18.090
I want to know what's
missing from the report.

24:18.158 --> 24:19.458
What do you know so far?

24:19.525 --> 24:21.059
His birth mother, marlene,

24:21.126 --> 24:22.893
She died of uncontrolled bleeding

24:22.961 --> 24:24.728
Due to cuts on her forearms. And his father,

24:24.795 --> 24:27.230
Vernon, he was found on
the floor of a motel room

24:27.297 --> 24:28.764
Babbling incoherently.

24:28.831 --> 24:31.366
Yes, he blamed himself

24:31.433 --> 24:34.234
One minute, he blamed his wife the next.

24:34.302 --> 24:35.502
He also blamed demons.

24:36.971 --> 24:40.606
Yeah, there was talk about demons.

24:40.674 --> 24:43.408
And then he died in a psychiatric
ward not much after that.

24:43.476 --> 24:45.343
Ok, you say you worked with the hospital.

24:45.411 --> 24:47.479
Is robert sick? Yes.

24:47.547 --> 24:48.613
Why?

24:48.681 --> 24:50.915
Is he suffering from insomnia,
by any chance?

24:52.384 --> 24:55.585
What else is missing from that report?

24:55.653 --> 24:58.322
No one would have adopted that boy

24:58.389 --> 25:00.125
If they knew the truth.

25:00.193 --> 25:01.728
The truth?

25:01.797 --> 25:03.299
That his father killed his mother.

25:03.366 --> 25:04.668
That he was insane.

25:04.736 --> 25:07.005
Because psychosis is genetic.

25:07.073 --> 25:09.274
Because at the time,
it seemed like the worst thing

25:09.341 --> 25:11.375
You could pass on to a child.

25:11.443 --> 25:13.577
At the time? Was there something else?

25:13.645 --> 25:16.614
The doctors didn't even know
that the disease existed,

25:16.682 --> 25:19.584
Not until there was another death
in the family like vernon's.

25:19.652 --> 25:22.120
A woman, robert's sister.

25:22.187 --> 25:23.721
Extremely rare.

25:23.789 --> 25:26.024
It's called fatal familial insomnia.

25:26.092 --> 25:27.392
And if a parent has it,

25:27.460 --> 25:29.561
You have a 50% chance of inheriting it.

25:29.629 --> 25:31.396
So how is it treated?

25:31.464 --> 25:33.598
It's not. There's no cure.

25:33.666 --> 25:36.033
The body can't live without rest.

25:36.101 --> 25:38.435
Yeah, for a few weeks,

25:38.503 --> 25:39.637
Months at the most.

25:39.704 --> 25:41.338
After that, psychosis sets in.

25:41.406 --> 25:43.474
Organ failure.

25:43.541 --> 25:45.141
And death.

25:47.510 --> 25:50.479
It says in the obit lane dokes died

25:50.547 --> 25:51.880
Of an undisclosed illness.

25:56.654 --> 25:58.053
Yep.

25:58.121 --> 25:59.355
That's robert's sister.

25:59.422 --> 26:00.989
It's the ghost I saw outside the morgue.

26:01.057 --> 26:02.424
She was 24.

26:02.492 --> 26:04.559
Her father died in his early thirties.

26:04.627 --> 26:06.294
Kids got split up after that.

26:06.361 --> 26:09.196
She went into foster care
and robert got luckier.

26:09.264 --> 26:11.332
Yeah, if you call that luck.

26:11.399 --> 26:12.833
Coming down with a fatal
disease that I wouldn't wish

26:12.900 --> 26:14.568
On my worst ex-girlfriend.

26:14.635 --> 26:15.935
When she said he didn't mean to hurt her,

26:16.003 --> 26:17.570
She was talking about the father.

26:17.638 --> 26:19.472
When she said he wasn't dangerous...

26:19.540 --> 26:20.640
She meant her brother.

26:20.707 --> 26:22.708
Yeah. Obviously, she's still very confused.

26:22.776 --> 26:25.211
That's what happens when
most of what you remember

26:25.278 --> 26:27.679
From your final days is hallucinatory.

26:27.746 --> 26:28.913
Poor dead looney tune.

26:28.981 --> 26:30.147
Yeah, I have to tell robert.

26:30.215 --> 26:32.216
Tell him what? "hey, good news,

26:32.283 --> 26:33.417
"you probably didn't kill anyone.

26:33.484 --> 26:35.151
"bad news is visions that
made you think you did,

26:35.219 --> 26:37.019
"are little home movies of dad killing mom.

26:37.087 --> 26:38.921
"oh, and by the way,
he and your sister went bonko

26:38.989 --> 26:41.590
And died of a fatal disease
that you inherited."

26:44.894 --> 26:46.928
I gotta call you back.

27:28.098 --> 27:31.434
Wake up quick, before it's too late.

28:05.394 --> 28:06.594
Hey, hey, hey, whoa.

28:06.662 --> 28:08.296
Are you ok?

28:11.299 --> 28:13.300
Depends on which melinda you're asking.

28:13.368 --> 28:14.601
Sorry?

28:14.669 --> 28:16.669
I'll explain later. What's going on?

28:16.737 --> 28:17.937
Robert's gone.

28:18.005 --> 28:19.639
Gone-gone?

28:19.706 --> 28:20.739
Yeah, they searched the hospital.
He's nowhere.

28:20.807 --> 28:22.908
He's disappeared.

28:24.744 --> 28:26.711
His name is robert wharton.

28:26.779 --> 28:28.746
I'm his girlfriend, can't you find him?

28:33.951 --> 28:34.851
Thanks.

28:35.169 --> 28:36.669
I just needed some air.

28:36.737 --> 28:38.571
We're sorry to add to your worries.

28:38.639 --> 28:41.373
There's no cure? You're sure?

28:41.441 --> 28:43.109
There's no cure?

28:43.176 --> 28:45.073
That's what we've been told.

28:45.140 --> 28:47.274
And you think his father is haunting him?

28:47.342 --> 28:48.509
Why?

28:48.577 --> 28:50.277
Maybe to warn him. We're not sure.

28:51.979 --> 28:55.847
What's awful is this is the
first thing I've heard in weeks

28:55.915 --> 28:57.549
That actually makes sense.

28:57.616 --> 29:00.417
When you get used to your
boyfriend's boss calling,

29:00.485 --> 29:02.552
Asking if he's drinking for breakfast.

29:02.620 --> 29:04.520
Do you mind telling us what happened

29:04.588 --> 29:06.155
Before he disappeared?

29:06.223 --> 29:09.191
You mean after he lost his job?

29:09.258 --> 29:13.094
He started calling all times,

29:13.161 --> 29:14.528
Day and night,

29:14.596 --> 29:17.164
Asking strange, bizarre questions.

29:17.232 --> 29:19.534
Sometimes he'd accuse me of things.

29:19.602 --> 29:20.968
He sounded paranoid?

29:21.036 --> 29:24.372
At first I thought it was
a bad case of cold feet.

29:24.440 --> 29:26.140
Cold feet?

29:26.208 --> 29:29.343
We'd just recently talked
about getting married,

29:29.411 --> 29:32.079
Maybe even having kids.

29:33.682 --> 29:35.316
Did he ever tell you about
dreams he may have had?

29:35.384 --> 29:37.685
Hallucinations?

29:37.753 --> 29:39.553
Yes.

29:39.621 --> 29:40.955
A lot.

29:41.022 --> 29:42.723
The second he would close his eyes,

29:42.791 --> 29:44.958
Or sometimes even when
his eyes were still open,

29:45.026 --> 29:47.160
He would see these creatures.

29:47.228 --> 29:49.462
Uh, I don't remember what he called them.

29:49.530 --> 29:51.731
Demons?

29:51.799 --> 29:54.767
That's right. Demons.

29:54.834 --> 29:56.601
Do you know what that means?

29:56.669 --> 29:59.469
Vernon, his birth father,
said that he saw demons, too.

29:59.536 --> 30:01.703
I thought they were all just delusions.

30:01.771 --> 30:04.439
Are you telling me that they weren't?

30:04.506 --> 30:06.039
Hey. Hey.

30:06.107 --> 30:07.173
Did you find anything?

30:07.241 --> 30:09.208
Yeah, robert's brain scans just came back,

30:09.276 --> 30:12.043
And, um, they don't show any physical damage

30:12.111 --> 30:14.378
Or abnormalities that would
explain the symptoms.

30:15.780 --> 30:20.317
So he has it. It's in his blood.

30:20.384 --> 30:23.019
How else would you explain the insomnia?

30:24.588 --> 30:25.621
Look...

30:25.689 --> 30:27.222
How long does he have?

30:27.290 --> 30:28.590
Wait a minute, wait a minute, helen.

30:28.658 --> 30:31.059
This doesn't mean that he has ffi.

30:31.126 --> 30:32.693
We don't know that yet.

30:32.761 --> 30:34.128
There are tests that can
better determine that.

30:34.196 --> 30:36.730
But even if he has the disease,

30:36.798 --> 30:38.464
There are remedies for
these kinds of things.

30:38.532 --> 30:40.165
I mean, treatments.

30:40.233 --> 30:41.900
Obscure stuff that no one knows about

30:41.967 --> 30:43.934
Because the disease itself is so rare.

30:44.002 --> 30:46.202
Look, there's always hope.

30:46.270 --> 30:47.737
Excuse me.

30:54.545 --> 30:56.613
You're making a bad mistake.
You need to leave him alone.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.047
Your son is sick.

30:58.115 --> 30:59.349
Those doctors will make him worse.

30:59.416 --> 31:00.550
How?

31:00.617 --> 31:02.051
They're gonna try to make him sleep.

31:02.119 --> 31:03.719
He needs sleep. He's gonna die without it.

31:03.787 --> 31:06.422
No. Sleep is what they need.

31:06.490 --> 31:08.457
Who, the doctors or the demons?

31:08.525 --> 31:10.427
Look, in my vision it said

31:10.495 --> 31:12.497
That I had to wake up
before it was too late.

31:12.565 --> 31:14.902
Is that because that's when the demons come?

31:14.969 --> 31:16.671
They come when your guard is down.

31:16.739 --> 31:18.907
They wake up when you go to sleep.

31:20.410 --> 31:22.578
No, no!

31:22.646 --> 31:25.918
Stop!

31:28.454 --> 31:30.888
Uhh!

31:32.091 --> 31:33.658
Uhh!

31:36.262 --> 31:38.432
114.

31:38.500 --> 31:40.203
114.

31:40.270 --> 31:41.704
That's the motel room where she died.

31:41.772 --> 31:42.705
What were you doing there?

31:42.773 --> 31:44.040
I wasn't myself.

31:44.107 --> 31:46.742
Do you understand? That wasn't me.

31:46.810 --> 31:48.310
Of course not. It was a sickness.

31:48.378 --> 31:50.545
No. It was them.

31:50.613 --> 31:52.213
They got inside me.

31:52.281 --> 31:53.614
The demons?

31:53.682 --> 31:56.149
My son needs me before he goes to sleep

31:56.217 --> 31:58.652
And before they get him, too.

32:13.233 --> 32:15.400
Forget your keys?

32:15.468 --> 32:16.801
robert.

32:16.868 --> 32:18.736
You scared me.

32:18.804 --> 32:20.605
Why are you hiding like that?

32:20.672 --> 32:24.342
You must be exhausted, too, huh?

32:24.409 --> 32:26.310
So tired of this.

32:26.378 --> 32:29.680
I was--I was so worried.

32:29.748 --> 32:31.982
Why did you run away from the hospital?

32:32.050 --> 32:33.350
I'm afraid.

32:33.418 --> 32:35.286
There's nothing to be afraid of.

32:35.353 --> 32:36.520
But you have to--

32:36.588 --> 32:38.655
I'm afraid of myself, all right?

32:38.723 --> 32:39.889
What do you mean?

32:39.957 --> 32:41.958
I can't control it anymore.

32:42.026 --> 32:43.161
What?

32:43.229 --> 32:44.699
The things in my head.

32:46.535 --> 32:51.506
Robert, there's something I
need to explain to you, ok?

32:51.574 --> 32:53.842
Sit down.

32:55.545 --> 32:57.747
So I am going crazy?

32:57.814 --> 32:58.948
Because this thing?

32:59.016 --> 33:01.317
But the doctors think
there might be treatments.

33:01.384 --> 33:03.718
Which is why you have to
go back to the hospital.

33:03.786 --> 33:05.219
No.

33:05.287 --> 33:06.353
I don't like it there.

33:06.421 --> 33:07.754
I don't...

33:07.822 --> 33:10.558
Robert, please.

33:17.465 --> 33:19.132
No, no. I don't want to hurt you.

33:19.200 --> 33:20.133
I don't want to hurt you.

33:20.201 --> 33:22.869
You won't. I know you.

33:24.237 --> 33:25.571
Listen, I just--

33:25.638 --> 33:27.839
I've got tea boiling and
I've got to grab my purse.

33:27.907 --> 33:29.674
Just come inside. No, no.

33:29.742 --> 33:31.876
I can't. I'm--I'm scared to
be alone with you in there.

33:33.445 --> 33:34.912
Ok, then just wait.

33:34.980 --> 33:37.381
Wait here.

33:37.448 --> 33:39.349
I love you.

33:42.186 --> 33:44.020
I love you, too.

35:04.898 --> 35:07.700
You can end it, robert.

35:10.737 --> 35:12.871
Just one step, take it, take it.

35:22.067 --> 35:23.834
Hey.

35:23.902 --> 35:25.502
I just talked to detective blair.
There's no sign of him.

35:25.569 --> 35:27.170
So how long can he live without sleep?

35:27.238 --> 35:29.506
Well, he may not have to find out.

35:29.573 --> 35:30.507
What do you mean?

35:30.575 --> 35:31.741
I did a little extra research.

35:31.809 --> 35:33.276
It turns out that the root cause of ffi

35:33.344 --> 35:35.544
Is a thing called a prion
protein in the brain.

35:35.612 --> 35:37.313
It's related to mad cow.

35:37.382 --> 35:38.549
But we checked robert's blood samples.

35:38.617 --> 35:39.683
And it's not there?

35:39.751 --> 35:41.185
Well, the test isn't conclusive,

35:41.253 --> 35:43.988
But I'm starting to think this
guy does not have this disease.

35:44.056 --> 35:46.824
Which of course raises the question,

35:46.892 --> 35:48.425
Why the hell's he staying up all night?

35:48.493 --> 35:50.226
I think our answer's right in front of us.

35:53.130 --> 35:55.431
Well, in case it isn't,

35:55.498 --> 35:58.033
I'm gonna keep checking
with our staff neurologist.

36:01.503 --> 36:02.436
Oh, have you seen robert?

36:02.504 --> 36:04.371
No, why? God. Where is he?

36:04.439 --> 36:05.539
No, no, no. What happened?

36:05.607 --> 36:08.108
I told him the truth about his disease.

36:08.176 --> 36:09.276
No.

36:09.343 --> 36:10.677
He promised me he would
come back and get help,

36:10.744 --> 36:12.111
Then he disappeared.

36:12.179 --> 36:15.014
If you know where your son is,
you have to tell us.

36:15.082 --> 36:17.349
Even if you found him,
you couldn't help him.

36:17.417 --> 36:18.617
What do you mean?

36:18.685 --> 36:20.185
Think of his options.

36:20.253 --> 36:21.720
Insanity and then death.

36:21.788 --> 36:22.988
Or just death.

36:23.056 --> 36:24.256
Is that what you chose?

36:24.324 --> 36:25.491
You went to that motel

36:25.558 --> 36:27.526
To cage your own demon, didn't you?

36:27.594 --> 36:28.527
I don't understand.

36:28.595 --> 36:31.398
I had a vision with demons,

36:31.465 --> 36:32.633
But they were me.

36:32.701 --> 36:33.901
Just like the demon that
was in robert's room,

36:33.969 --> 36:35.169
It was a version of robert,

36:35.236 --> 36:36.436
And you saw that, too.

36:36.504 --> 36:38.205
You knew that something
wanted to hurt your family

36:38.273 --> 36:40.040
And that's why you locked yourself away.

36:40.108 --> 36:41.675
But you wanted to make sure

36:41.743 --> 36:43.543
That it would never
threaten your family again.

36:44.645 --> 36:46.713
And that's why you took the knife.

37:06.602 --> 37:08.202
114.

37:08.270 --> 37:09.770
You said not to go there,

37:09.838 --> 37:12.139
But that's because you never stopped wishing

37:12.207 --> 37:13.807
That your mother had stayed away.

37:13.875 --> 37:15.676
How did she know where he went?

37:15.743 --> 37:18.811
I remember her dialing...

37:18.879 --> 37:20.914
And dialing.

37:20.982 --> 37:24.483
She called all of our friends.

37:25.686 --> 37:26.787
All of his family.

37:26.855 --> 37:30.824
She called hospitals. She called the police.

37:30.892 --> 37:32.660
I have to find...

37:32.728 --> 37:33.995
And then she called the bank.

37:34.062 --> 37:35.029
I tried the hospital.

37:35.097 --> 37:37.332
And they told her

37:37.399 --> 37:42.002
That was the last place
he used the credit card.

37:42.070 --> 37:43.504
That's how she found you.

37:43.571 --> 37:45.405
It's very hard to remember.

37:45.473 --> 37:48.242
In my vision I saw you swing

37:48.309 --> 37:49.776
That knife up and away from her, like you--

37:49.844 --> 37:52.579
I didn't want her to take it.

37:52.647 --> 37:54.782
I left the door unlocked and she came

37:54.849 --> 37:56.783
And she saw me. Stop, please.

37:56.851 --> 37:57.984
She knew what I was doing there.

37:58.052 --> 38:00.020
give me the knife.

38:00.088 --> 38:01.121
I need you to go!

38:01.189 --> 38:02.122
Please.

38:02.190 --> 38:03.824
She saw the knife

38:03.892 --> 38:05.459
And she tried to take it,

38:05.527 --> 38:07.727
And I didn't want her to take it.

38:07.795 --> 38:10.130
I was just trying to keep
it from her, that's all.

38:12.567 --> 38:15.336
Don't. No.

38:15.404 --> 38:17.839
Stop.

38:17.907 --> 38:19.341
Ahh!

38:19.409 --> 38:21.778
Aah!

38:21.846 --> 38:23.447
Oh!

38:23.515 --> 38:24.648
I didn't know that I'd cut her,
I just wanted her out

38:24.716 --> 38:25.816
So I could finish what I started.

38:26.885 --> 38:28.319
And then I shoved her out the door.

38:28.386 --> 38:31.255
After that, I'm not sure what happened.

38:32.856 --> 38:34.323
She was crying.

38:35.725 --> 38:39.227
And I wouldn't open the door.

38:40.562 --> 38:42.663
I'd hoped that she'd gotten away from me.

38:42.731 --> 38:44.131
Then she was finally safe, and with me gone,

38:44.199 --> 38:45.299
We'd both have some peace.

38:45.367 --> 38:47.601
I'd hoped that she was safe.

39:03.180 --> 39:05.749
He didn't mean to hurt her.

39:05.816 --> 39:06.950
No, of course he didn't.

39:07.018 --> 39:09.252
You're right about that.

39:09.320 --> 39:10.386
But what I don't get

39:10.454 --> 39:12.388
Is if robert isn't sick,

39:12.456 --> 39:14.357
Why did you suddenly start haunting him?

39:14.425 --> 39:16.726
Because he wasn't sick yet.

39:16.794 --> 39:19.062
He was talking about having children.

39:19.129 --> 39:20.930
You heard him. And you thought--

39:20.998 --> 39:23.500
He was worried our kids would inherit it.

39:23.567 --> 39:27.437
And you wanted to make sure
that would never happen again.

39:27.505 --> 39:28.971
Where's you son?

39:29.039 --> 39:30.940
He doesn't have to die.

39:40.383 --> 39:41.549
Robert, wait.

39:41.617 --> 39:42.717
Please wait.

39:42.785 --> 39:44.886
Stay away from me. Both of you.

39:44.954 --> 39:46.387
You don't have to do this.

39:46.455 --> 39:50.959
I don't want to. I don't, but...

39:51.027 --> 39:54.429
What if I told you that
you're probably not sick?

39:54.497 --> 39:56.397
I have to be.

39:56.465 --> 39:58.265
Why else can't I sleep?

39:58.333 --> 40:00.067
Because someone won't let you.

40:00.134 --> 40:02.735
Someone?

40:02.803 --> 40:04.337
Someone who loves you.

40:04.404 --> 40:08.239
Someone who's been very
confused for a very long time.

40:09.607 --> 40:13.008
Look, you thought that you
could keep your son awake

40:13.076 --> 40:15.476
By threading images into his thoughts

40:15.544 --> 40:17.577
That would keep the demons from
getting him like they got you,

40:17.645 --> 40:19.345
But you're wrong.

40:19.412 --> 40:21.179
And they never got you while you were asleep

40:21.247 --> 40:22.580
Because you never slept.

40:22.648 --> 40:24.848
No, I remember. I...

40:24.916 --> 40:27.616
I'd wake up. I would have done things.

40:27.683 --> 40:29.516
You may have had blackouts,

40:29.584 --> 40:31.351
But you never slept.

40:31.419 --> 40:33.920
You couldn't have. You had a disease.

40:35.355 --> 40:36.989
Is my father here?

40:37.057 --> 40:38.657
Yes.

40:38.725 --> 40:40.659
And your sister.

40:41.928 --> 40:43.995
Robert, please come off the ledge.

40:44.063 --> 40:46.630
Please come back to me.

40:49.734 --> 40:52.936
But the plans we made.

40:53.003 --> 40:56.739
Even if I'm not sick, what about our kids?

40:56.807 --> 40:59.775
This thing is still in my blood.

40:59.842 --> 41:02.744
Don't you know,

41:02.811 --> 41:05.746
One of the reasons I fell in love with you

41:05.813 --> 41:08.181
Was hearing you talk about your family.

41:08.249 --> 41:11.317
How thankful you were for having parents

41:11.385 --> 41:13.319
Who wanted you so badly.

41:13.387 --> 41:16.588
They didn't know what I was.

41:16.656 --> 41:18.423
And I do.

41:18.491 --> 41:21.792
And I...Love you.

41:21.860 --> 41:25.963
Robert, I want what your parents wanted.

41:26.030 --> 41:30.968
I want a family. And I want it with you.

41:33.037 --> 41:35.338
Please.

41:35.405 --> 41:38.040
Please.

42:05.635 --> 42:07.269
Well, they're gonna keep
him under observation

42:07.337 --> 42:08.504
For about 24 more hours.

42:08.571 --> 42:11.606
And that's just to be sure.

42:11.674 --> 42:15.076
Well, something tells me he's gonna be ok.

42:20.547 --> 42:22.714
You two can do now if you're ready.

42:25.718 --> 42:28.386
Say good-bye to him for us.

42:31.690 --> 42:33.725
Mom's waiting for us.

42:42.903 --> 42:44.503
They're gone.

42:44.571 --> 42:45.771
That is beautiful.

42:50.377 --> 42:52.245
What, all that love?

42:52.313 --> 42:54.681
No, all that sleep.

42:54.749 --> 42:56.116
you poor thing.

42:56.184 --> 42:57.919
When's your shift over?

42:57.987 --> 42:59.888
It should be over about now,

42:59.956 --> 43:01.923
But I can't seem to read my watch.

43:01.991 --> 43:02.958
You know what?

43:03.025 --> 43:04.693
I'm busting you out of here.

43:04.760 --> 43:06.027
Oh.

43:10.166 --> 43:12.934
Delia said that aiden was an angel.

43:13.002 --> 43:16.804
He only went downstairs
11 times after lights out.

43:16.872 --> 43:19.840
And hopefully it'll get easier for you to...

43:22.009 --> 43:23.540
Sleep.
