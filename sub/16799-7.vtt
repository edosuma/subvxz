WEBVTT

00:01.760 --> 00:04.297
Previously on Elementary...
I know it's not much,
but the price is right.

00:04.330 --> 00:05.365
The landlord know
about my record, right?

00:05.400 --> 00:07.038
That I'm on parole?

00:07.070 --> 00:10.369
He and my sister are friends,
and she vouched for you.

00:10.410 --> 00:12.173
How'd you get here before us?
You'll recall I know

00:12.210 --> 00:13.575
the owner
of a helicopter company.

00:13.610 --> 00:15.134
There was one going this way.

00:15.180 --> 00:16.602
How was your meeting
with Shinwell last night?

00:16.650 --> 00:18.709
Oh, he's still having
a tough time adjusting.

00:18.750 --> 00:20.377
Well, in his
former life,

00:20.420 --> 00:21.569
he_ was a lieutenant
In a drug gang,

00:21.620 --> 00:24.714
a position which afforded him
ample money and prestige.

00:24.750 --> 00:28.288
Now he has neither,
so he's craving what he lost.

00:29.730 --> 00:32.528
LIN:
That was delicious.

00:32.560 --> 00:34.198
Don't tell my mom,
but your scallion pancakes

00:34.230 --> 00:35.697
are even better than hers.

00:35.730 --> 00:37.561
Well, I just follow the recipe.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.192
It's like lab work.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.094
Mm. Flunked chem.

00:41.140 --> 00:43.108
Set the lab on fire.

00:43.140 --> 00:45.199
Well, accidents happen.

00:45.240 --> 00:47.606
Wasn't totally an accident.

00:48.680 --> 00:50.671
Speaking
of chemistry,

00:50.710 --> 00:53.076
I'd say our sister experiment's
going well.

00:53.120 --> 00:56.248
_ Yeah. _
No maJor explosrons yet.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.440
Hey, I've been
meaning to ask you,

00:58.490 --> 01:00.708
have you spoken
to Shinwell recently?

01:00.760 --> 01:03.524
No. Why?

01:03.560 --> 01:05.255
It's probably nothing.

01:07.760 --> 01:10.763
I saw him the other day
outside his building.

01:10.800 --> 01:12.438
I had a meeting with the owners.

01:12.470 --> 01:14.165
And?

01:14.200 --> 01:16.737
Before I got out of my taxi,
this car pulled up next to him.

01:16.770 --> 01:19.830
The guy who got out, he wasn't
wearing colors or anything,

01:19.880 --> 01:22.201
but...
You think he was a gang member?

01:22.250 --> 01:25.208
Looked like Shinwell knew him
but didn't want to talk to him.

01:25.250 --> 01:27.810
Or at least didn't want
to be seen talking to him.

01:27.850 --> 01:31.479
If Shinwell gets caught talking
to a member of his old gang,

01:31.520 --> 01:33.158
that is a parole violation.

01:34.590 --> 01:36.820
And if that man
is from a rival gang...

01:36.860 --> 01:38.680
Then that's even worse, right?

01:48.240 --> 01:50.765
(exhales)
Are we doing this?

01:50.810 --> 01:53.108
(siren wailing in distance)

02:07.420 --> 02:09.752
For Arturo.

02:23.940 --> 02:25.407
(gunshot)

02:25.440 --> 02:27.237
The name's
Bennett Nealy.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.771
Army vet, certified
parachute instructor,

02:29.810 --> 02:31.869
and minor-league
YouTube star.

02:31.910 --> 02:34.640
He's done base jumps
all over the world.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.841
Now, you couldn't pay me
to jump out

02:36.890 --> 02:38.289
of a perfectly good
airplane,

02:38.320 --> 02:40.959
let alone off the top
of a building.

02:40.990 --> 02:43.754
But his thrill-seeking
is not what killed him.

02:43.790 --> 02:46.520
He was shot twice, in midair,

02:46.560 --> 02:49.825
once in the arm,
once in the chest.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.792
Shots were fired
from those bushes.

02:51.830 --> 02:54.435
Found a couple
shell casings.

02:54.470 --> 02:55.698
No prints though.

02:55.740 --> 02:56.764
Witnesses?

02:56.810 --> 02:59.802
A valet
at a nearby hotel

02:59.840 --> 03:03.879
saw two men jump from the roof
of that skyscraper

03:03.910 --> 03:06.276
around 2:45 am.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.719
Then heard two gunshots.

03:07.750 --> 03:09.547
Now, according to him,

03:09.590 --> 03:12.957
one jumper plummeted
to the ground.

03:12.990 --> 03:16.221
The other landed safely
and then ran off.

03:17.290 --> 03:19.929
CSU found
a couple dozen

03:19.960 --> 03:21.825
of these
scattered around.

03:21.860 --> 03:25.421
Plus a broken thread
around Nealy's right wrist.

03:25.470 --> 03:27.938
They think it was a bracelet
that smashed to pieces

03:27.970 --> 03:29.938
on impact.

03:29.970 --> 03:32.404
Waste.

03:32.440 --> 03:34.908
You talking about the bracelet
or the vic?

03:34.940 --> 03:35.929
Bullets.

03:35.980 --> 03:37.572
Mr. Nealy was doomed

03:37.610 --> 03:38.907
the moment he stepped
off that building.

03:38.950 --> 03:41.646
(siren whooping in distance)

03:44.320 --> 03:45.719
(indistinct police transmission)

03:45.750 --> 03:47.479
It's just...

03:50.760 --> 03:52.955
(siren wailing in distance)

04:02.610 --> 04:07.001
So, base jump parachutes
don't have a rip cord.

04:07.040 --> 04:08.029
Instead, they have
a pilot chute.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.502
It's held around
the waist.

04:09.550 --> 04:10.505
You throw it out,

04:10.550 --> 04:11.972
the wind fills this,

04:12.010 --> 04:13.978
inflates it, and that, in turn,

04:14.020 --> 04:15.647
pulls the main chute
from its case.

04:15.680 --> 04:17.739
I noticed that
his pilot chute was missing.

04:17.790 --> 04:19.815
I mean, he managed
to release it,

04:19.860 --> 04:22.010
but his main chute
didn't deploy. Why?

04:22.060 --> 04:24.324
'Cause the connection was cut.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.726
You think his chute
was sabotaged?

04:26.760 --> 04:29.058
Isn't cutting
that line

04:29.100 --> 04:30.988
and shooting him
literally overkill?

04:31.030 --> 04:32.759
Well, it
would be,

04:32.800 --> 04:33.994
if it was one person.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.837
Perhaps it was two.

04:35.870 --> 04:38.509
A sniper and a saboteur.

04:38.540 --> 04:40.599
In a manner
of speaking,

04:40.640 --> 04:42.642
Bennett Nealy
was murdered twice.

04:50.990 --> 04:54.949
He was supposed to help me
put together the cradle today.
BELL: Mrs. Nealy,

04:54.990 --> 04:56.548
can you think of anyone
who would've wanted

04:56.590 --> 04:57.955
to hurt your husband?

04:57.990 --> 05:01.323
You mean can I think
of two people? Right?

05:01.360 --> 05:03.396
Someone who would've shot him

05:03.430 --> 05:06.467
and someone_who_ would've
tampered With his chute.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.639
Chutes, actually.

05:08.670 --> 05:10.706
Police found
three more

05:10.740 --> 05:13.436
base jumping parachutes
in the storage shed

05:13.480 --> 05:16.005
in your backyard.

05:16.040 --> 05:17.769
All sabotaged
as well.

05:17.810 --> 05:20.472
Who had access to that shed?

05:20.520 --> 05:23.409
Bennett always left it unlocked.

05:23.450 --> 05:25.418
We live in a safe neighborhood.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.486
We don't even have a back fence.

05:27.520 --> 05:28.782
Anyone could have
gotten in.

05:28.820 --> 05:31.527
So, I have to ask,
can anyone vouch

05:31.560 --> 05:34.654
for your whereabouts
last night around 2:45?

05:34.700 --> 05:37.669
You're asking me
if I shot my husband?

05:37.700 --> 05:39.668
I'm eight months pregnant.

05:39.700 --> 05:41.588
I don't even own a gun.

05:42.670 --> 05:45.559
I went out
with my girlfriends.

05:45.610 --> 05:46.804
It's what I always do
when Bennett jumps,

05:46.840 --> 05:48.535
to keep from
worrying.

05:48.580 --> 05:50.377
We were at a bar until 2:00.

05:50.410 --> 05:52.002
I was the designated driver.

05:52.050 --> 05:54.917
I dropped my last friend off
around 3:00.

05:54.950 --> 05:57.748
And what about
the sabotaged parachutes?

05:57.790 --> 05:59.610
All I can tell you

05:59.660 --> 06:02.458
is that I didn't want Bennett
to jump at all.

06:02.490 --> 06:06.449
I kept texting him
to call it off and come home.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.092
You can check
my phone.

06:08.130 --> 06:13.136
Why would I tell him not to jump
ifI wanted him dead?

06:14.140 --> 06:15.994
What did Mark say?

06:16.040 --> 06:17.598
Mark Trenchman.

06:17.640 --> 06:19.005
He's Bennett's cameraman.

06:19.040 --> 06:20.678
You haven't talked to him yet?

06:20.710 --> 06:22.974
Was he hurt,
too?

06:23.010 --> 06:25.501
A witness saw
a second base jumper land safely

06:25.550 --> 06:26.642
and then flee the scene.

06:26.680 --> 06:28.614
So you think that was Mark?

06:28.650 --> 06:31.687
If Mark jumped with Bennett,

06:31.720 --> 06:34.553
he's not the one
who shot at him, right?

06:34.590 --> 06:36.524
But he could've sabotaged

06:36.560 --> 06:37.925
Bennett's chute.

06:37.960 --> 06:40.520
Can you think of any reason
he would have?

06:40.560 --> 06:42.152
Mark and Bennett
used to have

06:42.200 --> 06:44.566
a partner. Arturo.

06:44.600 --> 06:49.503
But three months ago, Bennett
and Arturo collided in midair.

06:49.540 --> 06:52.577
Arturo was knocked out
and never deployed his chute.

06:52.610 --> 06:54.009
He died on impact.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.645
Mark blamed Bennett
for the collision.

06:56.680 --> 06:57.977
Bennett blamed Mark
for not warning them

06:58.010 --> 06:59.204
they were too close.

06:59.250 --> 07:01.218
Ithought
they put it behind them.

07:01.250 --> 07:04.014
Last night's jump
was supposed to be in memory

07:04.050 --> 07:06.553
of Arturo.
But...

07:06.590 --> 07:08.558
You're suggesting
that Mark planned

07:08.590 --> 07:10.455
a different kind of memorial.

07:18.270 --> 07:21.068
I ran out of coffee,
so I made us some tea.

07:21.100 --> 07:22.738
Anything useful?

07:22.770 --> 07:25.568
Amongst other things,
confirmation that Bennett Nealy

07:25.610 --> 07:27.805
and his compatriots were
in a sort of addiction spiral.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.149
Each stunt of theirs was
more dangerous than the last.

07:30.180 --> 07:32.512
A cavalcade of risk,
served up electronically

07:32.550 --> 07:36.748
to an audience of _
sensation-cravmg millennials.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.746
Your phone rang
while you were downstairs.

07:38.790 --> 07:40.485
It was Marcus.

07:40.520 --> 07:42.750
The police pinged
Mark Trenchman's phone.

07:42.790 --> 07:43.882
They found it
in a trash can a block

07:43.930 --> 07:45.659
from where Nealy died.

07:45.690 --> 07:47.794
Must've thrown it away
when he ran.

07:47.830 --> 07:50.719
Obviously, Mr. Trenchman
doesn't want to be found.

07:50.770 --> 07:53.739
I predict we'll have him
in custody within the hour.

07:53.770 --> 07:57.536
Not only did the danger of
our trio's stunts increase

07:57.570 --> 08:00.004
over time-- so, too, did
the quality of their videos.

08:00.040 --> 08:03.544
It appears Mr. Trenchman
recently bought an 8K camera.

08:03.580 --> 08:05.741
Such cameras come pre-equipped
with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

08:05.780 --> 08:08.817
They also typically cost
between $50,000 and $70,000.

08:08.850 --> 08:11.739
There's no way
he's throwing that in the trash.
I managed

08:11.790 --> 08:14.611
to isolate the serial number
of Mr. Trenchman's new camera

08:14.660 --> 08:16.855
from the metadata hidden
in his YouTube footage.

08:16.890 --> 08:20.053
So whilst pinging his cell phone
proved useless...

08:20.100 --> 08:23.069
Pinging his camera
should tell us where he is.

08:24.870 --> 08:27.759
Oh, hey.
Trenchman just got here.

08:27.800 --> 08:30.769
We snagged him and his camera
in a hotel near the jump site.

08:30.810 --> 08:33.677
I'm gonna set him up
in Interrogation One.

08:35.810 --> 08:37.573
What's your sister
doing here?

08:37.610 --> 08:39.578
You remember how she helped
Shinwell with his apartment?

08:39.620 --> 08:42.589
She went to the building
for a meeting the other day,
and she saw

08:42.620 --> 08:45.817
someone approach him that she
thought might be a gang member.

08:45.850 --> 08:47.579
You fear it was
an old ally.

08:47.620 --> 08:48.951
Or an old enemy.

08:48.990 --> 08:51.788
I asked Marcus to set her up
with some old arrest photos.

08:51.830 --> 08:54.594
Why not just ask
Shinwell who it was?

08:54.630 --> 08:56.291
I haven't spoken to him
in a few weeks.

08:56.330 --> 08:57.797
I thought I'd give him
some space.

08:57.830 --> 09:00.139
This is you giving him
some space, is it?

09:00.170 --> 09:03.628
_Go on. I'll
jom Marcus.

09:03.670 --> 09:06.207
For Arturo.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.841
I'm telling you,
I didn't kill Bennett.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.279
HOLMES:
Once Bennett's wife--

09:13.320 --> 09:15.675
sorry, his widow--
identified you,

09:15.720 --> 09:17.278
we did some research.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.288
We know there were arguments
between you,

09:19.320 --> 09:20.810
physical altercations.

09:20.860 --> 09:23.852
Look, after Arturo died,

09:23.890 --> 09:26.688
we both blamed each other.
It was wrong.

09:26.730 --> 09:28.823
And we fought.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.590
But we were like brothers. I
mean, that's what brothers do.

09:31.630 --> 09:33.860
I-I loved Bennett.

09:33.900 --> 09:35.697
We settled our differences.

09:35.740 --> 09:37.139
BELL:
Not all of 'em.

09:37.170 --> 09:39.877
According to this e-mail,
you wanted to turn your footage

09:39.910 --> 09:43.801
of Arturo Alzado's last jump
into a documentary.

09:43.850 --> 09:46.000
Only Bennett
wasn't so keen on the idea.

09:46.050 --> 09:48.075
I thought it was
what Arturo would've wanted.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.008
All right? He loved publicity.

09:50.050 --> 09:52.883
Filming ourjumps, putting 'em
online, that was his idea.

09:52.920 --> 09:55.081
He was even writing a book.

09:55.120 --> 09:56.929
From the correspondence,
Bennett seemed to think

09:56.960 --> 09:59.087
that you were trying to cash in
on Arturo's death.

09:59.130 --> 10:01.018
So he refused to sign off

10:01.060 --> 10:02.766
on any of the footage
that he appeared in.

10:02.800 --> 10:04.392
Which was a problem, because...

10:04.430 --> 10:06.933
he was in all of it.
Killing him
wouldn't just put

10:06.970 --> 10:08.767
a stop to his objections--

10:08.800 --> 10:10.859
it would also give your
documentary a bang-up ending.

10:10.910 --> 10:13.105
No. No, you're wrong.

10:13.140 --> 10:15.631
Look, I gave up
on the documentary.

10:15.680 --> 10:18.877
Bennett and I agreed to do
one last jump to honor Arturo.

10:18.910 --> 10:21.879
We only filmed it for us
and for Arturo's family.

10:21.920 --> 10:24.343
Look, i-if I was the one that
messed with Bennett's chute,

10:24.390 --> 10:26.017
why would I film
the whole thing?

10:26.050 --> 10:28.848
Why would I keep the tape,
preserving the evidence

10:28.890 --> 10:31.859
of my own crime?
If you had nothing to do
with Bennett's death,

10:31.890 --> 10:33.892
why were you in hiding?

10:33.930 --> 10:36.353
Because... (sighs)

10:36.400 --> 10:38.925
I was afraid I was next.

10:38.970 --> 10:41.268
I only know one person
good enough with a rifle

10:41.300 --> 10:43.803
to shoot Bennett
out of the air like that,

10:43.840 --> 10:46.058
and she has just as much reason
to kill me

10:46.110 --> 10:47.930
as she did to
kill Bennett.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.800
She?

10:49.850 --> 10:51.875
(indistinct chanting)

10:51.910 --> 10:55.243
Got to say, that's
one hell of a rifle.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.817
It's custom. A Tubb 2000.

10:57.850 --> 10:59.750
I use it in competition.

10:59.790 --> 11:02.782
Looks like the perfect weapon
to shoot a man out of the slq.

11:02.830 --> 11:05.981
I'm a cadet, okay?

11:06.030 --> 11:07.827
You have any idea
what that means?

11:07.860 --> 11:09.828
My life is scheduled
to the second.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.895
I'm under a microscope
the whole time.

11:11.930 --> 11:14.239
Classes, training, bed checks,
formations, inspections.

11:14.270 --> 11:16.932
There's no way
I could have snuck off campus,

11:16.970 --> 11:18.369
driven to Manhattan,
shot Bennett,

11:18.410 --> 11:19.877
then gotten back to my barracks

11:19.910 --> 11:21.878
without my roommate
or the gate guards noticing.

11:21.910 --> 11:24.401
Say you're right-- you didn't
sneak out the other night

11:24.450 --> 11:27.248
to shoot Bennett Nealy-- you
still get weekend leave, right?

11:27.280 --> 11:29.919
And Poughkeepsie's less than
an hour from the academy.

11:29.950 --> 11:32.885
You could have _driven there to
tamper With his parachutes.

11:32.920 --> 11:36.253
Mark Trenchman told you
to talk to me, didn't he?

11:36.290 --> 11:38.485
Guy always was
scared of me.

11:38.530 --> 11:40.828
Can't imagine why.
You think

11:40.860 --> 11:43.328
I killed Bennett because of what
happened to my brother.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.361
Only my brother wasn't like
regular people.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.891
He lived life full tilt.

11:47.940 --> 11:49.396
When he was in the Army,
he volunteered

11:49.440 --> 11:51.931
for multiple deployments
to Afghanistan and Iraq.

11:51.970 --> 11:55.337
After he was discharged, he went
back as a private contractor.

11:55.380 --> 11:58.042
He loved base-jumping.
He drove too fast,

11:58.080 --> 11:59.502
drank too much.

11:59.550 --> 12:01.017
He was living on borrowed time,

12:01.050 --> 12:02.813
and everyone
in my family knew it.

12:02.850 --> 12:05.910
So you didn't blame Bennett
at all.

12:05.950 --> 12:07.815
Bennett was doing
everything he could

12:07.860 --> 12:09.282
to make things right with us.

12:09.320 --> 12:11.129
He made face-to-face apologies,

12:11.160 --> 12:13.321
promised to pay for Arturo's
kids to go to college.

12:13.360 --> 12:16.420
And did Trenchman tell you
about Arturo's memoir?

12:16.460 --> 12:18.894
We know that your brother
was writing a book.

12:18.930 --> 12:21.194
What did Bennett Nealy
have to do with it?

12:21.240 --> 12:23.208
Arturo sold it
to a big publishing house.

12:23.240 --> 12:25.333
He was writing about
his time as a soldier,

12:25.370 --> 12:27.907
his work as a parachute
instructor back in the Gulf,

12:27.940 --> 12:29.305
his base-jumping.

12:29.340 --> 12:31.171
Bennett was with him
for all of that,

12:31.210 --> 12:34.373
so when Arturo died, he promised
he'd finish the book.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.843
My brother's kids would have
gotten a big pay-out

12:36.890 --> 12:38.289
when it was done.

12:38.320 --> 12:40.185
Plus, it was going
to be Arturo's legacy,

12:40.220 --> 12:42.017
something for them
to remember him by.

12:42.060 --> 12:44.278
Even ifI hadn't
forgiven Bennett,

12:44.330 --> 12:47.299
I never would have killed him
before the book was finished.

12:47.330 --> 12:49.969
I wouldn't have done that
to my niece and nephew.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.867
Don't believe me,
take my rifle.

12:52.900 --> 12:54.891
But I'm telling you right now,

12:54.940 --> 12:57.238
it's not gonna be a match
for those bullets.

12:59.940 --> 13:02.534
WATSON:
Hey. The captain just called.

13:02.580 --> 13:06.300
He said he didn't have enough to
hold Mark Trenchman, so he had

13:06.350 --> 13:07.977
to kick him lose.
Just as well.

13:08.020 --> 13:10.488
He's as middling a suspect
as he is a cameraman.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.215
How'd it go at West Point?

13:12.250 --> 13:14.980
While Arturo'_s sister
appears to be Innocent,

13:15.020 --> 13:16.419
the trip did bear some fruit.

13:16.460 --> 13:18.428
Arturo is writing a memoir.

13:18.460 --> 13:19.927
She provided me with a copy.

13:19.960 --> 13:21.552
I perused it on my way home,

13:21.600 --> 13:22.965
and I found this.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.969
WATSON:
Is that money?

13:26.000 --> 13:27.991
Tens of millions
of dollars.

13:28.040 --> 13:31.168
One of many such cash shipments
sent to Iraq during the war.

13:31.210 --> 13:32.973
But there are
perSIstent rumors

13:33.010 --> 13:35.934
that much of this shipment
went missing in 2010.

13:35.980 --> 13:37.242
The photograph
is captioned,

13:37.280 --> 13:39.407
"Our One Regret."

13:39.450 --> 13:43.011
Oh. There's nothing
in the text about the picture.

13:43.050 --> 13:45.848
Arturo and Bennett never got to
tell their side of the story.

13:45.890 --> 13:47.289
While Arturo's death
was ruled an accident,

13:47.320 --> 13:49.618
Bennett's was as far from an
accrdent as one could get.

13:49.660 --> 13:51.525
Sabotaged, shot.

13:51.560 --> 13:54.120
He did everything but land in a
freshly-chummed pool of sharks.

13:54.160 --> 13:55.957
Well, you think
he was killed because...

13:56.000 --> 13:57.888
he and Arturo stole
some of this money?

13:57.930 --> 14:00.990
Let's just say, I'd be curious
to learn their one regret.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.065
WATSON:
This was taken
when they were both

14:03.110 --> 14:04.600
working as contractors, right?

14:04.640 --> 14:06.608
I've been going
through Bennett's financials,

14:06.640 --> 14:08.039
and there's nothing
that indicates

14:08.080 --> 14:09.968
he's been sitting
on millions of dollars.

14:10.010 --> 14:11.341
But according to this,

14:11.380 --> 14:14.019
six months ago, a shell
account he controlled

14:14.050 --> 14:17.110
received a wire transfer
of $500,000

14:17.150 --> 14:20.051
from a company called
"Primi In Agrum LLP."

14:20.090 --> 14:21.978
"First to the field."

14:22.020 --> 14:24.454
Now, Primi In Agrum,
when I looked it up,

14:24.490 --> 14:26.424
I saw that
it was also the motto

14:26.460 --> 14:29.122
for the 28th Special
Tactics Squadron.

14:29.160 --> 14:31.196
It's an Air Force _ _
commando unIt speCIallzmg

14:31.230 --> 14:34.097
in search and rescue,
air field security.

14:34.140 --> 14:36.096
They call themselves
"Hell Jumpers."

14:36.140 --> 14:38.062
So, notice

14:38.110 --> 14:43.241
the tattoos on this security
contractor and this one.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.043
Skull with dagger
and wings on one,

14:45.080 --> 14:47.071
Air Force eagle
on the other.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.418
What if Arturo and
Bennett's one regret

14:49.450 --> 14:51.008
was not taking the money,

14:51.050 --> 14:52.415
even though they knew
other people had?

14:52.450 --> 14:54.088
You think these men

14:54.120 --> 14:55.417
were ex-Hell Jumpers,

14:55.460 --> 14:57.018
they took the money, and then,

14:57.060 --> 14:59.324
Bennett later decided
he wanted a cut?

14:59.360 --> 15:01.555
Maybe he decided
to blackmail them.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.465
The $500,000 could mean

15:03.500 --> 15:06.162
that at least one of them
was Willing to pay.

15:06.200 --> 15:09.089
And from what I've read,
Hell Jumpers are expert snipers

15:09.140 --> 15:10.300
and trained parachutists.

15:10.340 --> 15:12.205
So one of them
could have shot him.

15:12.240 --> 15:14.174
One of them could have
tampered with his chute.

15:14.210 --> 15:16.178
Or both.

15:16.210 --> 15:18.041
So all we would have to
do is look for four men

15:18.080 --> 15:19.547
trained to survive
behind enemy lines,

15:19.580 --> 15:22.572
move without detection and
kill without compunction.

15:22.620 --> 15:24.440
How hard
could that be?
(sighs)

15:29.160 --> 15:31.583
MAN:
Those look like they're from
a tasbih. Muslim prayer beads.

15:31.630 --> 15:33.518
Blue ones are from Afghanistan.

15:33.560 --> 15:36.620
I brought back a set like that
when I came for my nieces.

15:36.660 --> 15:39.128
It was supposed to be
for good luck.

15:39.170 --> 15:41.092
As a good luck charm,

15:41.140 --> 15:43.961
my victim's tasbih
failed spectacularly.

15:44.010 --> 15:45.466
(laughs)
Oh, I take it

15:45.510 --> 15:48.035
you didn't bring me here
to talk about his jewelry.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.638
I was hoping
you might have some insight

15:49.680 --> 15:51.272
into these four guards.

15:51.310 --> 15:53.471
We think they might be
former Air Force commandos.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.169
This isn't about that money

15:55.220 --> 15:57.188
that supposedly went missing
in Iraq, is it?

15:57.220 --> 16:00.155
Because...
I'm not a fan of those stories.

16:00.190 --> 16:03.250
Nonetheless, I do need
the names of these four men.

16:03.290 --> 16:05.281
The security company that
employs them has not been

16:05.330 --> 16:08.026
forthcoming, and I thought with
you contracts in the military,

16:08.060 --> 16:10.528
and the IAVA...
Yeah, I suppose

16:10.570 --> 16:13.664
I could swing something, but
it's gonna ruffle some feathers.

16:13.700 --> 16:15.736
Well, my intention
is to solve a murder,

16:15.770 --> 16:18.762
not to offend
the United States military.
It's always

16:18.810 --> 16:20.232
about a murder.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.736
Look, I've had eight
of my birds fly around

16:21.780 --> 16:22.678
the harbor of New York for you.

16:22.710 --> 16:25.543
Plus, that private
airlift to Bear Mountain?

16:25.580 --> 16:28.674
That's $10,000
between pilot time and fuel.

16:28.720 --> 16:31.746
Now, the way I see it,
the debt I owe you

16:31.790 --> 16:33.553
is paid in full.

16:33.590 --> 16:35.785
Well, then perhaps it's time
I extended my line of credit.

16:35.820 --> 16:37.549
I couldn't help

16:37.590 --> 16:39.285
but notice that recently

16:39.330 --> 16:40.729
your personal grooming habits
have become a little lax.

16:40.760 --> 16:43.467
And you're normally
a very fastidious man.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.058
Is it right to assume that
you've finally broken up

16:45.100 --> 16:46.795
with that erratic girlfriend?

16:46.830 --> 16:49.390
Want to go ahead and guess
my weight while you're at it?

16:49.440 --> 16:51.237
I could if you'd like,
but instead,

16:51.270 --> 16:53.500
perhaps you'd like
to know the name...

16:53.540 --> 16:55.770
of a woman who is secretly
smitten with you?

16:55.810 --> 16:58.404
(laughs)
Someone_ in our
mutual soaal Circle.

16:58.450 --> 17:01.442
If someone was smitten with me,
I think I would know.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.380
That's unlikely.
You chronically underestimate

17:03.420 --> 17:05.479
your appeal to the opposite sex.

17:05.520 --> 17:08.785
Um... was it Genevieve
from Chopper Three?

17:08.820 --> 17:10.720
Hmm.

17:10.760 --> 17:13.297
Suzy from our Thursday meeting?

17:14.700 --> 17:17.225
Is it... Joan?

17:17.270 --> 17:20.068
Genevieve has a girlfriend,
Suzy is wholly unsuitable,

17:20.100 --> 17:22.489
and if Joan were interested,
she would be here

17:22.540 --> 17:24.599
rather than attending
to personal business.

17:24.640 --> 17:27.336
Well, I'm out of guesses.
Well, in that case,

17:27.380 --> 17:30.178
you give me the names
of four potential killers,

17:30.210 --> 17:34.214
and I'll give you the name
of one potential paramour.

17:34.250 --> 17:36.275
(rapid beeping, whip cracking)
WATSON:
Laquan Eversley?

17:36.320 --> 17:37.844
(explosion in game)
Tall Boy.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.846
You the detective that
had me come down here?

17:39.890 --> 17:41.687
'Cause I don't know nothing
about no car break-ins.

17:41.720 --> 17:44.120
Yeah, I know you didn't break in
to any of those cars.

17:44.160 --> 17:46.128
It's just a way
to get you down to the station.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.627
Listen, I'm not a cop.

17:47.660 --> 17:49.821
I just wanted
to ask you a few questions.

17:49.860 --> 17:52.192
If you ain't a cop, I ain't
got nothing to say to you.

17:52.230 --> 17:54.130
Listen, I can call
your probation ofﬁcer.

17:54.170 --> 17:56.593
Do they know you're still
active in your gang?

17:57.910 --> 17:59.832
What do you want?

17:59.870 --> 18:02.100
I want to talk to you
about Shinwell

18:02.140 --> 18:04.370
and why you approached him
at his apartment the other day.

18:04.410 --> 18:07.117
What do you care
about me and Shin?

18:07.150 --> 18:08.845
I know
the two of you came up together.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.518
You were both arrested
as co-defendants

18:10.550 --> 18:11.847
in a break-in when you were 18.

18:11.890 --> 18:14.711
Neither of you would
testify against each other.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.627
I ain't no snitch.
Shinwell, neither.

18:17.660 --> 18:19.787
No, but you are on his list
of criminal associates,

18:19.830 --> 18:22.492
people that he's forbidden to
contact, so if you really are

18:22.530 --> 18:25.124
his friend, and you want to help
him, you stay away from him.

18:25.170 --> 18:26.569
(laughs)

18:26.600 --> 18:28.329
What's funny?

18:28.370 --> 18:30.509
You got it all backwards.

18:30.540 --> 18:32.838
Wasn't my idea to meet.
It was his.

18:32.870 --> 18:35.134
He asked me to come by,
catch up a little.

18:35.180 --> 18:37.148
You want to sermonize someone,
try him.

18:37.180 --> 18:39.205
I'm sure he, uh,
be straight with you,

18:39.250 --> 18:41.445
seeing as you his friend
and all.

18:43.950 --> 18:46.839
(elevator bell dings)

18:46.890 --> 18:49.552
(buzzer sounds)

18:49.590 --> 18:52.229
(door squeaks open)

18:54.400 --> 18:56.527
Technical Sergeant Declan Boyle.

18:56.560 --> 18:58.824
Thank you so much
for coming by. Do come in.

18:58.870 --> 19:02.260
The Chief Master Sergeant
of the Air Force asks you

19:02.300 --> 19:05.508
to do something, you do it, no
matter how long you've been out.

19:05.540 --> 19:08.338
Um, I should mention,

19:08.380 --> 19:10.848
drawing the pistol
in your ankle holster

19:10.880 --> 19:12.279
at any point would be a mistake.

19:12.310 --> 19:14.312
Your arrival here
has been recorded

19:14.350 --> 19:15.840
and sent to a secure server.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.610
So, you know, kill me
at your own peril. (chuckles)

19:18.650 --> 19:20.709
I'll take that
under advisement.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.251
You want to tell me
what the hell this is about?

19:23.290 --> 19:25.349
You're doing very well
for a former enlisted man.

19:25.390 --> 19:28.723
Five-figure watch on your wrist,
the luxury SUV parked outside.

19:28.760 --> 19:30.318
I understand
you recently purchased

19:30.370 --> 19:31.860
a condominium in Midtown.

19:31.900 --> 19:34.539
This all leads me to
think that I'm correct

19:34.570 --> 19:35.969
to suspect
that you once stole money

19:36.000 --> 19:37.763
intended
for the Iraq War effort.

19:37.810 --> 19:43.373
But the question is, whether
you murdered someone over it.

19:43.410 --> 19:45.549
BOYLE: Everyone else
is getting rich off that war.

19:45.580 --> 19:48.413
Haliburton, Blackwater.

19:48.450 --> 19:50.941
My friends and I--
we figured, why not us?

19:50.990 --> 19:53.254
So we took a handling
fee, all right?

19:53.290 --> 19:55.258
Just enough to get
us on our feet

19:55.290 --> 19:56.484
once we stopped
contracting.

19:56.520 --> 19:58.624
But I never ki||_ed
anyone over it.

19:58.660 --> 20:01.356
Especially not
Bennett Nealy.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.265
The two of you were based
at the same facility

20:03.300 --> 20:05.291
at the time
the money disappeared.

20:05.330 --> 20:07.798
Recently, you paid Bennett
a half a million dollars.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.569
It paints a certain picture.

20:09.600 --> 20:12.262
Your colleagues are either dead
or overseas, so you're the only

20:12.310 --> 20:14.278
one who _could have accessed
his parachute,

20:14.310 --> 20:15.675
or taken that shot
that killed him.

20:15.710 --> 20:17.507
I had zero motive
to kill Bennett.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.609
The SUV out front,
the condo--

20:19.650 --> 20:20.947
the money I took
didn't pay for that.

20:20.980 --> 20:22.277
It wasn't nearly enough.

20:22.320 --> 20:23.981
I'm doing well
because I invested

20:24.020 --> 20:26.614
all of it in off-the-books,
high-interest loans.

20:26.650 --> 20:28.652
You're saying
you're a loan shark?

20:28.690 --> 20:30.783
The 500 grand I wired Bennett
wasn't a blackmail payment.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.388
It was a loan.

20:32.430 --> 20:33.920
25% interest.

20:33.960 --> 20:35.598
Bennett was paying
me ten grand a month,

20:35.630 --> 20:37.427
every month, never
missed one payment.

20:37.470 --> 20:40.792
So why would I kill a cash cow
that's giving me so much milk?

20:43.440 --> 20:45.362
What did he do
with the money you lent him?

20:45.410 --> 20:47.935
So Bennett Nealy
bought an airplane.

20:47.980 --> 20:51.438
Specifically, a slqdiving
plane, secured via

20:51.480 --> 20:52.947
an off-the-books loan

20:52.980 --> 20:55.039
and through yet another
shell company.

20:55.080 --> 20:56.843
So why all the secrecy?

20:56.880 --> 20:59.417
Why, it's an
excellent question.

20:59.450 --> 21:01.315
How did it go

21:01.360 --> 21:03.351
with Tall Boy?

21:03.390 --> 21:06.052
Not great, actually.

21:06.090 --> 21:09.753
He said that Shinwell
reached out to him.

21:09.800 --> 21:12.394
Yeah, you believe him?

21:15.800 --> 21:19.463
so it's not a surprise that
he'd want to see his old friend.

21:19.510 --> 21:21.478
But it would fight the idea
that he's honoring

21:21.510 --> 21:23.944
the conditions of his parole.

21:25.850 --> 21:28.318
As a sponsor, I've learned
that I'm not responsible

21:28.350 --> 21:30.489
for my sponsee's mistakes.

21:30.520 --> 21:33.409
I'm not Shinwell's sponsor.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.484
Hmm. Aren't you?
(door opens)

21:34.520 --> 21:35.987
BELL:
Hey. You made it.

21:37.860 --> 21:39.054
WATSON:
You find something?

21:39.090 --> 21:42.423
Well, for one thing, Bennett
didn't fly this plane himself.

21:42.460 --> 21:43.666
He had a partner.

21:43.700 --> 21:45.998
Chet Polian.

21:46.030 --> 21:48.066
All the flights
are in his name.

21:48.100 --> 21:50.091
It looks like he and Bennett

21:50.140 --> 21:51.767
have been running
parachuting charters,

21:51.810 --> 21:53.471
"North Atlantic
Slqdiving Tours."

21:53.510 --> 21:55.330
They fly out of this airport
and one other,

21:55.380 --> 21:56.733
but there's a twist.

21:56.780 --> 21:58.338
It looks like they're
advertising trips

21:58.380 --> 22:00.416
out of Ontario and Quebec.

22:00.450 --> 22:02.372
According to his records,
Bennett's mother

22:02.420 --> 22:04.388
is from Winnipeg,
so he's a dual citizen.

22:04.420 --> 22:07.082
He could have gotten a Canadian
business permit easy enough.

22:07.120 --> 22:09.486
A plane controlled
by a shell company,

22:09.520 --> 22:12.489
funded by a secret loan;
flying in and out of Canada,

22:12.530 --> 22:14.020
What does that sound like?

22:14.060 --> 22:16.654
You think they're
smuggling drugs?

22:16.700 --> 22:18.588
Or something else.

22:32.480 --> 22:35.972
BELL:
Passenger seats...
in the cargo hold.

22:37.650 --> 22:40.483
Bennett and his partner
weren't smuggling drugs.

22:40.520 --> 22:42.715
They were smuggling people.

22:45.660 --> 22:49.118
HOLMES: We believe that Bennett
Nealy was, to coin a phrase,

22:49.160 --> 22:50.923
a "concierge coyote."

22:50.970 --> 22:53.495
A smuggler for well-heeled
illegal immigrants.

22:53.540 --> 22:54.734
WATSON:
His clients would arrive

22:54.770 --> 22:55.930
in Canada on tourist visas,

22:55.970 --> 22:59.565
then Bennett and his partner
would use their skydiving plane

22:59.610 --> 23:00.804
to take them across the border.

23:00.840 --> 23:03.502
Must have charged
a pretty penny,

23:03.550 --> 23:06.701
considering he could only
smuggle two people at a time.

23:06.750 --> 23:09.548
Any luck finding the pilot?
HOLMES: Turns out

23:09.580 --> 23:11.719
Chet Polian is a retiree

23:11.750 --> 23:13.854
confined to a nursing home
in San Diego.

23:13.890 --> 23:15.619
Whoever was flying for Bennett

23:15.660 --> 23:17.719
used Polian's license
without his knowledge.

23:17.760 --> 23:20.024
Local police took fingerprints
from the cockpit,

23:20.060 --> 23:22.494
Not a match on any databases.

23:22.530 --> 23:24.828
Marcus pulled the airport
security footage.

23:24.870 --> 23:26.690
He's going over it now
to see if he can use it

23:26.730 --> 23:30.166
to identify the pilot, or any
of the people he smuggled.

23:30.200 --> 23:34.432
You realize this opens up
a small army of suspects

23:34.480 --> 23:35.799
for Bennett Nealy's murder,
right?

23:35.840 --> 23:38.479
His pilot, his
shady customers.

23:39.880 --> 23:41.871
We got a problem.

23:45.220 --> 23:47.142
BELL:
So this footage is
a couple months old,

23:47.190 --> 23:50.523
but I'm pretty sure these were
two of Bennett's customers.

23:50.560 --> 23:54.519
The date and time jibe with
the logs he kept in his office.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.596
His plane returned from a trip
to Montreal not 20 minutes

23:56.630 --> 24:00.191
before these two got into
that limo, but that's not all.

24:00.230 --> 24:03.165
You know Mike over there is in
the Army Reserves, right?

24:03.200 --> 24:04.508
GREGSON:
Yeah.

24:04.540 --> 24:07.509
Did a few tours as an MP
in Afghanistan.

24:07.540 --> 24:09.576
When he was bringing that
witness in, he caught a look

24:09.610 --> 24:11.578
at my computer...

24:11.610 --> 24:13.475
recognized this guy
from an old wanted list.

24:13.520 --> 24:16.512
His name is Qadir Durrani.

24:16.550 --> 24:19.041
He's a Taliban warlord.

24:33.900 --> 24:35.595
Mr. Bell.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.500
Actually, it's Detective Bell,

24:38.540 --> 24:39.837
and I won't be needing a lift.

24:39.870 --> 24:41.701
We can walk to the
station from here.

24:41.740 --> 24:43.503
Uh, what are you talking about?

24:43.550 --> 24:44.801
Is this some kind of joke?

24:44.850 --> 24:46.203
You're a friend
of Bennett Nealy's,

24:46.250 --> 24:47.399
or at least you were.

24:47.450 --> 24:50.647
Every couple weeks, he'd pay you
to pick up clients of his

24:50.690 --> 24:52.817
at Poughkeepsie
Municipal Airport.

24:52.850 --> 24:55.057
I think I'm gonna call a lavwer.

24:55.090 --> 24:56.853
That's one idea.

24:56.890 --> 24:59.051
Another is to help us out.

24:59.090 --> 25:02.890
We're looking for one
of your passengers.

25:02.930 --> 25:04.568
Do you remember this man?

25:04.600 --> 25:06.659
More importantly,

25:06.700 --> 25:07.928
did you know
he was a terrorist?

25:12.840 --> 25:15.729
Checkmate.

25:15.780 --> 25:17.600
It's always good
to see you, Vadim.

25:17.650 --> 25:20.642
Next time, watch out
for those discovery checks.

25:26.620 --> 25:29.748
Might I have the next game?

25:31.990 --> 25:35.551
My board, so I go first. Cool?

25:39.100 --> 25:41.091
(indistinct conversations
nearby)

25:52.210 --> 25:53.609
Wonder what your
parole officer

25:53.650 --> 25:55.015
would think of you
hustling chess.

25:55.050 --> 25:57.610
I mean, technically,
it's gambling.

25:57.650 --> 25:59.686
Not gambling,
chess lessons.

25:59.720 --> 26:01.915
The way you mirrored
my opening, for example.

26:01.960 --> 26:05.054
Pretty conservative,
but I like to play

26:05.090 --> 26:07.183
with _a _|ittle
more creatIVIty, myself.

26:09.200 --> 26:10.599
I find, from time to time,

26:10.630 --> 26:12.268
playing it safe is
the best strategy.

26:12.300 --> 26:14.689
I mean, take
your situation.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.264
You're on parole.

26:16.300 --> 26:18.200
You're trying to adjust to life
without the money and prestige

26:18.240 --> 26:22.677
that your former position as a
gang lieutenant afforded you.

26:22.710 --> 26:25.372
It would be easy to see how
you could, uh, be tempted

26:25.410 --> 26:28.675
to try and recapture
those heights.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.915
To play once more
with aggression.

26:32.990 --> 26:36.118
I know all about temptation.

26:36.160 --> 26:38.788
That's why I avoid
people and places

26:38.830 --> 26:40.718
that might trigger a relapse.
Mmm.

26:40.760 --> 26:45.129
Well, it must be nice...
being able to place it safe.

26:45.170 --> 26:46.762
Wish I could do that.

26:46.800 --> 26:48.734
It's true, you have
certain disadvantages.

26:48.770 --> 26:50.260
But you also have...

26:50.300 --> 26:54.270
Watson... and she's
worried about you.

26:54.310 --> 26:56.972
You instigated a meeting with
a so-called friend of yours,

26:57.010 --> 26:59.149
Laquan "Tall Boy" Eversley.

26:59.180 --> 27:00.716
Ain't nothing to that.

27:00.750 --> 27:02.047
Just catching up.

27:02.080 --> 27:03.741
Well, even if that was true,

27:03.790 --> 27:07.715
interacting with Tall Boy
is no safer for you,

27:07.760 --> 27:10.251
than chatting with a heroin
dealer would be for me.

27:15.730 --> 27:19.393
You seem like an
intelligent man.

27:19.430 --> 27:23.161
Watson thinks
you have potential.

27:23.200 --> 27:27.159
I hate to see you fumble away
your current opportunity.

27:27.210 --> 27:31.749
I get you, I do,
and I appreciate the warning.

27:31.780 --> 27:33.372
I'll think on it.

27:33.410 --> 27:36.413
Say good night to your lady.

27:38.250 --> 27:40.241
(phone chimes)

27:43.390 --> 27:45.779
(laughs)
I've been summoned.

27:46.760 --> 27:49.422
Going to have to forfeit, but...

27:49.460 --> 27:51.269
Bishop takes pawn at F2.

27:51.300 --> 27:52.995
King to E2, bishop to G4.

27:53.030 --> 27:55.032
Checkmate.

27:57.910 --> 28:01.437
I do hope you can avoid
backsliding your way to prison.

28:01.480 --> 28:04.301
If for no other reason than I
would like to play you again.

28:12.450 --> 28:14.918
To be honest, Mr. Durrani,
when we sent E.S.U.

28:14.960 --> 28:18.327
to your hotel, we expected
to find you with your daughter.

28:18.360 --> 28:22.251
We know that you two flew
into the country together

28:22.300 --> 28:24.359
a few months ago.

28:24.400 --> 28:27.961
Imagine our surprise when
you turn up with your wife.

28:30.870 --> 28:34.977
You and this man arrived
in the United States

28:35.010 --> 28:36.978
just a few weeks ago.

28:40.310 --> 28:42.813
NAZRIA:
That's our son;
his name is Marjan.

28:42.850 --> 28:44.989
Where are your children now?

28:47.150 --> 28:49.084
HOLMES:
They're afraid if they
tell us we'll deport them.

28:50.360 --> 28:52.385
Your accent?
You spent some time in England?

28:52.430 --> 28:56.389
My parents sent me abroad during
the Russian occupation.

28:56.430 --> 28:57.522
GREGSON:_
Mrs. Durrani.

28:57.560 --> 28:58.629
Homeland Security, the FBI,

28:58.670 --> 29:01.389
and the Joint Terrorism
Task Force are on their way

29:01.440 --> 29:03.362
to speak with you.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.209
In the meantime,

29:05.240 --> 29:06.264
we have some questions
about the men

29:06.310 --> 29:08.198
who smuggled you into
the country.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.879
If you want to
help your cause,

29:10.910 --> 29:13.913
I suggest you cooperate with us.

29:13.950 --> 29:15.178
We'd be happy to,
but please understand

29:15.220 --> 29:19.247
that we came to America because
we were in fear for our lives.

29:19.290 --> 29:21.417
We need asylum.

29:21.460 --> 29:25.055
The Taliban has issued a death
sentence against my husband.

29:25.090 --> 29:26.284
Well, it's funny you
should mention that,

29:26.330 --> 29:27.319
because we have it
on good authority

29:27.360 --> 29:32.388
that your husband was a
local Taliban commander.

29:32.430 --> 29:34.261
(speaking in Pashto)

29:37.200 --> 29:39.532
Qadir was a village chieftain.

29:39.570 --> 29:41.800
Before the Americans came,

29:41.840 --> 29:44.843
he pledged fealty
to the Taliban.

29:44.880 --> 29:47.303
After the airstrikes
forced them out,

29:47.350 --> 29:50.979
he cooperated
with NATO forces.

29:51.020 --> 29:54.251
Then when NATO withdrew,
the Taliban returned in force.

29:54.290 --> 29:56.918
We tried to change
sides once again.

29:56.960 --> 29:58.279
But the Taliban
didn't trust you.

29:58.330 --> 30:00.184
NAZRIA:
They burned our home.

30:00.230 --> 30:01.299
Destroyed our village.

30:01.330 --> 30:04.458
The central government
did nothing.

30:04.500 --> 30:08.197
And when the Taliban murdered
my husband's brother,

30:08.240 --> 30:09.969
we knew we had to get out.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.163
We went to Pakistan,
then Canada.

30:13.210 --> 30:16.509
Where Bennett Nealy and his
partner flew you to America.

30:16.540 --> 30:19.873
GREGSON: A few nights ago,
Mr. Nealy was murdered.

30:19.910 --> 30:22.572
Maybe it was one of you
covering your tracks.

30:22.620 --> 30:25.316
Make sure your husband's
enemies couldn't find you.

30:25.350 --> 30:29.218
No. We didn't kill anyone.

30:29.260 --> 30:31.023
My brother-in-law's wife

30:31.060 --> 30:33.449
and his children are in Toronto.

30:33.490 --> 30:35.219
Bennett was supposed
to bring them next week.

30:35.260 --> 30:36.397
Why would we kill him?

30:36.430 --> 30:40.093
(Qadir speaking Pashto)

30:41.400 --> 30:43.459
He says that you should talk
to Bennett's pilot.

30:43.500 --> 30:45.468
Why him?

30:45.510 --> 30:47.034
He and Bennett
got into an argument

30:47.070 --> 30:48.139
after my son and I landed.

30:48.180 --> 30:51.069
At first we couldn't hear
what the fighting was about,

30:51.110 --> 30:52.998
but then the pilot began shoving

30:53.050 --> 30:55.371
Bennett; he called him
a traitor.

30:55.420 --> 30:57.376
I worried that the fight

30:57.420 --> 30:59.012
would bring the police.

30:59.050 --> 31:01.359
Marjan and I left the hangar
and got into a car,

31:01.390 --> 31:03.278
as we'd been instructed.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.629
The driver took us
to my husband and daughter.

31:05.660 --> 31:09.118
Would you be willing to describe
the pilot to our sketch artist?

31:09.160 --> 31:12.266
Of course.

31:15.500 --> 31:18.401
Stick and Rudder,
by Wolfgang Langewiesche.

31:18.440 --> 31:20.601
Give it a read.

31:20.640 --> 31:24.440
Hell, read it twice,
read it three times.

31:24.480 --> 31:26.141
Mr. Kasdan.

31:26.180 --> 31:28.375
Detective Bell, NYPD.

31:28.420 --> 31:29.944
My colleagues and I
want to talk to you

31:29.980 --> 31:32.346
about the murder
of Bennett Nealy.

31:32.390 --> 31:34.085
Why me?

31:34.120 --> 31:38.056
Let's just say you're
a person of interest.

31:39.960 --> 31:41.393
We know you piloted

31:41.430 --> 31:44.399
for Bennett Nealy
using someone else's license.

31:44.430 --> 31:47.263
You can deny it, but
we're pretty sure we'll be able

31:47.300 --> 31:50.269
to confirm it _
once we check your prints.

31:50.300 --> 31:53.531
Fine. I flew the plane.

31:53.570 --> 31:56.232
But I didn't file
the flight plan.

31:56.280 --> 31:59.204
If the wrong name got used,
that was on Bennett.

31:59.250 --> 32:01.218
As far as I know,
everything we were doing

32:01.250 --> 32:03.013
was on the up-and-up.

32:03.050 --> 32:05.314
Including hiding people
in the cargo hold?

32:05.350 --> 32:08.251
Like I said, I don't know
anything about that.

32:08.290 --> 32:10.212
It's a shame Bennett's not here
to defend himself.

32:10.260 --> 32:12.080
It's a very convenient shame.

32:12.130 --> 32:14.155
KASDAN:
Are you saying

32:14.200 --> 32:16.555
that you think I killed him?

32:16.600 --> 32:17.965
According to our witness,
you shoved him.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.228
Called him a traitor.

32:19.270 --> 32:21.238
Maybe he was trying
to cut you out,

32:21.270 --> 32:24.103
and you weren't having it.
I was in Ottawa
for a Rangers road game

32:24.140 --> 32:26.005
the night
Bennett was shot.

32:26.040 --> 32:28.975
I flew my Cessna.
You can check the flight plans.

32:29.010 --> 32:31.149
That's great.
But Bennett wasn't just shot.

32:31.180 --> 32:33.148
His parachute was sabotaged.

32:33.180 --> 32:35.341
What?
See, we're looking

32:35.380 --> 32:37.177
for two people, Mr. Kasdan.

32:37.220 --> 32:39.415
A murderer
and an attempted murderer.

32:39.450 --> 32:43.113
You say you can prove you were
in Ottawa the other night, fine.

32:43.160 --> 32:44.149
Doesn't mean
you couldn't have cut the cord

32:44.190 --> 32:46.158
to Bennett's pilot chute.

32:47.660 --> 32:50.026
I did it.

32:50.060 --> 32:52.119
Excuse me?

32:52.170 --> 32:53.194
I did it.
I...

32:53.230 --> 32:55.539
sabotaged Bennett's chute.

32:55.570 --> 32:57.435
Why?

32:57.470 --> 33:00.166
Well, it's like you said, I...

33:00.210 --> 33:02.098
I was getting cut out.

33:02.140 --> 33:04.176
And then I figured,
with him out of the way,

33:04.210 --> 33:06.474
I could take over the business
for myself.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.345
What?

33:11.390 --> 33:13.540
Would you be so kind
as to remove your gloves?

33:13.590 --> 33:15.478
I'd like to see your hands.

33:23.460 --> 33:25.223
Palms down.

33:28.300 --> 33:32.066
Well, you haven't said a
single true thing to us.

33:32.110 --> 33:34.305
That includes
your confe55ion.

33:34.340 --> 33:35.602
You didn't kill Bennett.

33:35.640 --> 33:38.143
You just want us
to think that you did.

33:40.250 --> 33:42.445
I don't understand.

33:42.480 --> 33:44.141
HOLMES: It's a simple
enough question.

33:44.190 --> 33:47.182
Do you pluck
between your eyebrows?

33:47.220 --> 33:48.255
Yeah.

33:48.290 --> 33:50.155
I have since junior high.

33:50.190 --> 33:52.784
Mmm. You have synophrys.

33:52.830 --> 33:54.559
Joined eyebrows.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.397
In addition, you lack hair
on the middle segments

33:56.430 --> 33:59.399
of your fingers
and on the backs of your hands.

33:59.430 --> 34:01.330
All three
of those conditions are

34:01.370 --> 34:03.167
recessive hereditary traits.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.737
Sharing one in common does not
prove a genetic relation,

34:05.770 --> 34:09.570
but sharing all three
strongly suggests kinship.

34:09.610 --> 34:12.306
What does this have to do
with my husband's death?

34:12.350 --> 34:15.319
It has to do with the confession
of one Gordie Kasdan.

34:15.350 --> 34:17.147
Pilot.
He said

34:17.180 --> 34:18.716
he sabotaged
your husband's chute.

34:18.750 --> 34:20.149
But we think he was covering

34:20.190 --> 34:22.658
for someone.
HOLMES: He,

34:22.690 --> 34:25.853
like you, has a unibrow,

34:25.890 --> 34:28.825
he lacks hair on the middle
segments of his fingers

34:28.860 --> 34:30.225
and on the backs of his hands.

34:30.260 --> 34:32.091
He's your father.

34:32.130 --> 34:34.667
WATSON: We think he
confessed to sabotaging

34:34.700 --> 34:37.692
Bennett's chute to protect you.

34:37.740 --> 34:40.129
Are we right?

34:43.240 --> 34:45.105
The other day,

34:45.150 --> 34:47.778
when you said
Bennett had been shot,

34:47.810 --> 34:50.540
part of me was relieved.

34:50.580 --> 34:52.787
I hadn't killed him.

34:52.820 --> 34:55.288
Someone else had.

34:55.320 --> 34:57.356
Why would you tamper
with his chutes?

34:57.390 --> 35:00.154
My pregnancy hasn't been easy.

35:00.190 --> 35:03.159
Lack of sleep, nausea,
the hormones...

35:03.200 --> 35:06.761
That's not an excuse for trying
to murder your husband.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.688
A couple weeks ago,
I heard him talking

35:08.740 --> 35:11.208
on the phone with some woman,
late at night.

35:11.240 --> 35:13.538
He thought I was asleep.

35:13.570 --> 35:16.368
I couldn't find any record
of the call on his cell,

35:16.410 --> 35:18.139
so I did a little poking around.

35:18.180 --> 35:22.276
Found one of those disposable
phones hidden in his car.

35:22.320 --> 35:23.673
There were all these texts
between him

35:23.720 --> 35:25.449
and someone
named Jaan.

35:25.490 --> 35:27.185
Two A's.

35:27.220 --> 35:30.155
In one of his messages,

35:30.190 --> 35:34.194
he promised her
he would leave me.

35:34.230 --> 35:36.448
So you decided to kill him.

35:36.500 --> 35:38.297
I was angry.

35:38.330 --> 35:40.321
I called my dad,
told him everything.

35:40.370 --> 35:42.668
Said I could solve
the whole thing

35:42.700 --> 35:45.498
with a pair of scissors and a
trip to Bennett's storage shed.

35:45.540 --> 35:48.509
I'm guessing that's why he tried
to take the blame.

35:48.540 --> 35:51.771
He realized I'd really done it.

35:53.450 --> 35:56.339
The night
of the jump,

35:56.380 --> 35:58.382
something changed.

35:58.420 --> 36:00.388
I didn't want Bennett to die.

36:00.420 --> 36:03.287
I tried to get him
to call off the jump.

36:03.320 --> 36:05.288
But he wouldn't listen.

36:05.330 --> 36:09.289
(crying)
He never did.

36:15.700 --> 36:18.669
Well, that explains
the sabotaged chute.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.769
But we're no closer
to the sniper.

36:20.810 --> 36:22.368
I think we are.

36:22.410 --> 36:24.799
I think the sniper
and Mrs. Nealy

36:24.850 --> 36:26.738
were both motivated
by Bennett's affair.

36:26.780 --> 36:29.476
And if I'm right
about the sniper's identity,

36:29.520 --> 36:32.239
we need to catch him soon.
'Cause I'm _certain_
he's gonna strike again.

36:37.920 --> 36:39.524
I-I don't understand.

36:39.560 --> 36:41.824
Why are you showing us these?

36:41.860 --> 36:45.819
We found them on the ground
where Bennett Nealy fell.

36:45.870 --> 36:48.839
In Afghanistan, young lovers
give each other tasbihs

36:48.870 --> 36:50.895
as a sign of affection, yes?

36:50.940 --> 36:54.398
(speaks Pashto)

36:54.440 --> 36:57.273
(speaking Pashto)

36:59.010 --> 37:00.978
He just asked you if you think
that they're hers,

37:01.010 --> 37:02.978
and you said, "Oh, I hope not."

37:03.020 --> 37:06.979
I'm assuming by "hers," you
meant your daughter, Zohala.

37:07.020 --> 37:08.556
You speak Pashto?

37:08.590 --> 37:09.852
Not fluently.

37:09.890 --> 37:12.427
Are these your daughter's
prayer beads?

37:14.960 --> 37:18.726
Bennett Nealy had a lover.
He called her Jaan.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.988
HOLMES: "Jaan," as
you're well aware,

37:21.030 --> 37:22.998
is the Pashto for "beloved."

37:23.040 --> 37:26.009
Bennett Nealy was having
an affair with your daughter.

37:29.810 --> 37:31.607
You didn't know?

37:31.650 --> 37:33.277
WATSON: We think
the sniper knew.

37:33.310 --> 37:35.346
That's why he killed Bennett.
Which brings us back

37:35.380 --> 37:38.679
to a question that you refused
to answer earlier.

37:38.720 --> 37:40.881
Where are your children?

37:40.920 --> 37:43.855
Zohala ran away

37:43.890 --> 37:46.757
shortly after Marjan and I
arrived in New York.

37:46.790 --> 37:48.997
She left a letter saying
that she wanted to...

37:49.030 --> 37:51.760
live her own life,
as a modern woman.

37:51.800 --> 37:54.598
We thought that
she was just being rebellious.

37:54.640 --> 37:57.063
So we sent Marjan to find her.

37:57.100 --> 37:59.933
Can we assume your son
has military training?

37:59.970 --> 38:04.669
When my husband was with the
Taliban, my son fought for them.

38:04.710 --> 38:06.678
He learned to shoot, to hide,

38:06.710 --> 38:09.508
to stalk his target.

38:09.550 --> 38:12.439
And they poured
their poison into his ears.

38:12.490 --> 38:14.708
What do you think your son
would do if he knew

38:14.760 --> 38:17.718
that your daughter was
sleeping with an American?

38:17.760 --> 38:21.059
The Taliban preaches
the old ways.

38:21.090 --> 38:22.694
In traditional culture,

38:22.730 --> 38:26.029
when a woman sleeps with a man
outside of wedlock,

38:26.070 --> 38:28.459
she dishonors
her entire family.

38:28.500 --> 38:32.709
The only way to restore
that honor is through blood.

38:32.740 --> 38:34.935
If Marjan thought
that Zohala and Bennett

38:34.980 --> 38:38.029
were dishonoring our family...

38:38.080 --> 38:40.878
He would kill them both.

38:40.910 --> 38:42.719
HOLMES:
So,

38:42.750 --> 38:44.479
if there's a way
you could help us find Marjan,

38:44.520 --> 38:46.112
his cell phone number, perhaps,

38:46.150 --> 38:49.586
be a good time to share it.

38:49.620 --> 38:52.054
(indistinct chatter)

39:07.440 --> 39:10.079
_ BELL:
Police! Don't move!

39:10.110 --> 39:11.099
Lower the gun, Marjan.

39:11.140 --> 39:12.505
MAN:
Target in sight.

39:12.550 --> 39:14.142
Three o'clock.
We have Visual.

39:14.180 --> 39:16.148
BELL:
Your parents sent us.

39:16.180 --> 39:18.114
They want you to live.

39:18.150 --> 39:20.948
They want you both
to live.
(sirens wailing)

39:20.990 --> 39:23.857
(wailing stops)

39:23.890 --> 39:25.118
MAN 2:
Inside! Quick!

39:25.160 --> 39:26.787
This way, please.

39:26.830 --> 39:28.024
Move! Move!

39:28.060 --> 39:31.154
Nobody here wants to hurt you.

39:31.200 --> 39:34.397
Just put
the gun down.

39:42.180 --> 39:45.069
(indistinct police transmission)

39:48.080 --> 39:50.116
(handcuffs clacking)

39:50.150 --> 39:52.710
(elevator dings)

39:55.720 --> 39:57.813
Marjan.

40:06.070 --> 40:08.026
Zohala.

40:08.070 --> 40:12.632
* Mmm...

40:12.670 --> 40:14.638
*

40:14.680 --> 40:19.470
* Mmm...

40:19.510 --> 40:22.115
(phone chimes)

40:22.150 --> 40:27.645
* A sigh went across my bones

40:27.690 --> 40:29.157
(knocking)

40:29.190 --> 40:33.058
* Didn't I tell you,
shut the door? *

40:33.090 --> 40:36.059
Come in.

40:36.100 --> 40:38.523
Been a while.

40:38.570 --> 40:41.061
It has.

40:41.100 --> 40:45.161
I heard you had a conversation
with an old friend of mine.

40:45.210 --> 40:46.734
I did.

40:46.770 --> 40:49.534
He said that you reached out
to him. Is that true?

40:49.580 --> 40:52.606
Say it was.

40:52.650 --> 40:55.039
Okay, well,

40:55.080 --> 40:57.878
do you know what would happen
to you if a parole officer knew

40:57.920 --> 40:59.945
that you were hanging out
with Tall Boy?
Tall Boy

40:59.990 --> 41:02.254
is not your problem.

41:02.290 --> 41:04.520
Neither am I.

41:04.560 --> 41:06.482
Not no more.

41:06.530 --> 41:09.522
Okay, but you asked me
for my help.

41:09.560 --> 41:11.152
And now I know better.

41:11.200 --> 41:12.758
You can't help me.

41:12.800 --> 41:15.098
Really?

41:15.140 --> 41:18.234
You think you know everything.
You don't.

41:18.270 --> 41:20.500
You just walked
into a criminal's apartment

41:20.540 --> 41:22.838
in the middle of the night.
A basement apartment.

41:22.880 --> 41:26.043
You can shoot a gun down here--
nobody'll hear it.

41:26.080 --> 41:27.877
It's not your world. It's mine.

41:27.910 --> 41:29.639
It's where I have to live,

41:29.680 --> 41:31.545
and it's where I have
to survwe.

41:31.590 --> 41:33.888
Why are you saying this?

41:33.920 --> 41:36.115
Because this world's
not safe.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.981
Not for me. And especially
not for you. So get out.

41:39.030 --> 41:40.486
While you still can.

41:41.930 --> 41:43.898
(loud crashing)

41:43.930 --> 41:47.798
(exhales)
It's now or never, Doc.

41:47.830 --> 41:53.905
* What did you wish
on that storm? *

41:53.940 --> 41:56.738
* Was it worth it

41:56.780 --> 41:59.578
* Selling your soul?

42:02.350 --> 42:08.550
* Not a lot left to see

42:08.590 --> 42:12.959
* Won't you let them
in their only? *
