00:03.460 --> 00:04.650
I don't know this number.

00:05.870 --> 00:06.939
Hello?

00:08.440 --> 00:10.310
It's Gabi, you don't have
to use the fake voice.

00:10.340 --> 00:12.340
I'm back from China and
I had an amazing time!

00:12.370 --> 00:14.410
Oh, my god,
what is wrong with you?

00:14.440 --> 00:16.270
I haven't heard from
you in three weeks!

00:16.300 --> 00:18.810
I'm sorry, but do you know how much
international cell phone plans cost?

00:18.840 --> 00:20.650
Thousands! You can't
even check your messages.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.510
Wait a second,
you never checked your messages?

00:22.590 --> 00:24.380
Uh, no. Why?
Did you leave me one?

00:24.470 --> 00:28.370
No. Uh, but if someone did,
when would you be hearing them?

00:28.940 --> 00:30.810
Uh, when I get my luggage.

00:30.840 --> 00:31.920
Come pick me up. I gotta go.

00:31.950 --> 00:34.450
This guy said I could borrow his phone
if I carried his bag through customs,

00:34.480 --> 00:36.850
and I just read a sign that
said I should not do that.

00:41.910 --> 00:43.600
Don't know this number.

00:44.270 --> 00:45.270
Hello?

00:45.940 --> 00:47.410
Josh, it's Sofia.

00:47.440 --> 00:49.530
Gabi's back from China. She
just called me from the airport,

00:49.560 --> 00:51.420
and she never got your message.

00:51.830 --> 00:52.560
What?

00:52.590 --> 00:53.850
Her phone was off
the whole time.

00:53.880 --> 00:56.330
Look, she didn't reject you,
she just never got your message.

00:56.380 --> 00:58.270
Oh my god,
then she never has to hear it!

00:58.300 --> 01:00.120
Why would you not
want her to hear it?

01:00.150 --> 01:02.520
Because I'm a human being
who can experience shame?

01:03.670 --> 01:04.830
Look, I've been racking my brain

01:04.860 --> 01:06.440
trying to figure out a way
to make this less awkward

01:06.470 --> 01:08.390
when I see her,
and now I don't have to.

01:08.420 --> 01:11.020
Yes, you do! She has a
right to hear that message!

01:11.050 --> 01:13.630
That long, awkward message.

01:14.360 --> 01:18.320
No. She's moved on, I've moved
on, everything's changed.

01:18.900 --> 01:20.730
What do you mean
"everything's changed"?

01:23.080 --> 01:24.840
Happy two-week anniversary.

01:26.230 --> 01:27.400
Who's that?

01:27.470 --> 01:28.720
Who is that?

01:30.050 --> 01:31.920
I'll meet you at the
airport in 15 minutes.

01:33.040 --> 01:34.910
I'll meet you at the
airport in 16 minutes.

01:36.000 --> 01:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:57.900 --> 01:59.700
Josh, you have to
tell her how you feel.

01:59.730 --> 02:01.150
No, I don't.

02:01.180 --> 02:02.970
That was so three weeks ago.

02:03.480 --> 02:06.580
But she's going to hear the message
when she turns on her phone anyway.

02:06.610 --> 02:08.009
Not if I get her a new phone.

02:08.039 --> 02:08.990
How's that gonna happen?

02:09.020 --> 02:10.870
Because in every airport,
there's a...

02:11.330 --> 02:12.390
I love America.

02:13.650 --> 02:14.680
Sofia!

02:15.440 --> 02:17.390
Welcome home!
It's so good to see you!

02:17.420 --> 02:18.310
You too!

02:18.340 --> 02:21.230
Though I will miss being the
only blonde in a 10-mile radius.

02:21.380 --> 02:22.790
So, what's going on?
What did I miss?

02:22.820 --> 02:25.550
Nothing!
Nothing, everybody shut up.

02:26.860 --> 02:28.950
Josh, hi!
What are you doing here?

02:28.980 --> 02:30.650
What are any of us doing here?

02:30.680 --> 02:32.760
Really, that's the question
that haunts me every day.

02:32.900 --> 02:34.880
So, how was it?
Best time of your life?

02:34.910 --> 02:36.040
Killer, awesome, amazing?

02:36.070 --> 02:38.040
Yes, it was absolutely perfect.

02:38.760 --> 02:39.850
Hear that, Sofia?

02:39.990 --> 02:41.430
Yes, I do.

02:41.640 --> 02:44.330
Perfect because you like Cooper,
or China?

02:44.360 --> 02:45.120
Both.

02:45.150 --> 02:47.170
No, pick one.
You have to pick one.

02:48.450 --> 02:50.880
Uh, okay. Cooper then.

02:50.910 --> 02:53.720
I mean, he's amazing.
He's sexy, he's confident,

02:53.750 --> 02:55.090
and he knows
everything about China.

02:55.120 --> 02:58.190
Chinese people were asking him
where to find the best chinese food.

02:58.730 --> 03:00.700
What she's saying is
she's happy with Cooper.

03:01.410 --> 03:04.660
So, there's nothing left
to say except, shwah!

03:04.790 --> 03:05.880
A new phone?

03:05.910 --> 03:07.420
Why'd you do that?
I have mine right here.

03:07.450 --> 03:09.020
You don't have to turn that on,
no.

03:09.670 --> 03:10.520
Why not?

03:10.550 --> 03:13.450
While you were gone, there was a
phone virus that swept the country.

03:13.480 --> 03:16.140
People everywhere were talking
face-to-face. It was horrible.

03:18.470 --> 03:19.800
But, hey, no worries.

03:19.830 --> 03:21.760
I'll just transfer the stuff from
your old phone to your new phone.

03:21.790 --> 03:24.620
You can grab it tomorrow when you come
to work, and then you can meet Jilly.

03:25.170 --> 03:27.470
Jilly! Aww, did you get a kitty?

03:28.830 --> 03:30.890
No. I got a girlfriend.

03:32.210 --> 03:33.660
That was fast.

03:33.690 --> 03:36.010
No, me and Jilly met a while
ago at this tech conference,

03:36.040 --> 03:38.420
which makes her sound kind of nerdy,
but she's not, she's just super smart,

03:38.450 --> 03:40.510
and like, really hot. Did I
mention she's a beauty queen?

03:40.540 --> 03:42.930
Anyway, she found out me
and Caroline broke up,

03:42.960 --> 03:46.010
and she sent me this Facebook
message, and the rest is history.

03:46.570 --> 03:49.340
Well, would you look at that,
we are all so happy!

03:49.960 --> 03:52.750
I know, right? Like, you have
cooper, I have Jilly, Sofia has...

03:52.780 --> 03:53.980
A new phone.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.400
As long as you
keep it on silent.

04:06.180 --> 04:09.230
Oh, so that's how he gets
his hair to stand on end.

04:10.280 --> 04:12.660
I figured he just looked at
himself in the mirror naked.

04:14.170 --> 04:16.720
By the way, Yolanda,
I've been meaning to thank you.

04:16.750 --> 04:17.470
For what?

04:17.500 --> 04:18.890
Not wearing a skirt.

04:21.160 --> 04:22.880
All right, done.

04:23.110 --> 04:25.760
I just transferred everything from
Gabi's old phone onto my laptop,

04:25.790 --> 04:27.040
then loaded it
onto her new phone.

04:27.070 --> 04:29.950
Except that awkward message,
which now no one will hear.

04:33.050 --> 04:35.540
After I called off my wedding,
you're the one I wanted to see, Gabi.

04:35.570 --> 04:38.360
I even drove to your house climbed
up your fire escape with roses

04:38.390 --> 04:40.200
to Pretty Woman you.

04:43.390 --> 04:44.590
Now, no one will hear it.

04:47.390 --> 04:50.730
Ooh, here comes that
fine window washer.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.600
He can squeegee me any day.

04:56.130 --> 04:57.650
Please, like you have a chance.

04:57.680 --> 05:00.490
Half the women in the building
want to get "squeegeed" by him.

05:00.810 --> 05:01.840
Get out.

05:03.940 --> 05:05.060
Hi!

05:05.230 --> 05:07.870
You are hot.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.400
Hey, guys!

05:25.430 --> 05:27.730
Back from China,
never looked finah.

05:29.350 --> 05:31.740
Seems like you've been
gone forever, baby!

05:31.770 --> 05:34.320
Really? It already seems like
you've been back forever.

05:36.620 --> 05:37.830
So, how was your trip?

05:37.860 --> 05:41.000
China was amazing! Everywhere we
went, they treated us like royalty.

05:41.030 --> 05:42.920
Of course, they all thought
I was Carrie Underwood.

05:43.940 --> 05:44.780
Here you go.

05:44.810 --> 05:46.280
I transferred all your info.

05:46.310 --> 05:49.010
And all the messages you need
to hear are in this phone.

05:49.300 --> 05:50.900
Great. Okay, thanks, Josh.

05:51.260 --> 05:52.770
Is this a welcome
back breakfast?

05:52.800 --> 05:55.670
Kinda. This magnificent
feast is courtesy of Jilly.

05:56.390 --> 05:57.310
The new girlfriend.

05:57.340 --> 05:58.240
The one and only.

05:58.270 --> 06:00.970
You must be Gabi.
Aren't you cute as a button!

06:01.950 --> 06:03.290
Hi,
it's really nice to meet you.

06:03.320 --> 06:04.170
I borrowed one of your aprons,

06:04.200 --> 06:05.590
- I hope you don't mind.
- Oh, of course not.

06:05.620 --> 06:06.910
Good. Now,
come sit your sweet buns down

06:06.940 --> 06:08.750
and have some of my sweet
buns while they're still warm.

06:08.780 --> 06:09.790
Okay.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.820
I always thought I hated
all girls who cooked.

06:11.850 --> 06:13.330
Turns out, just you.

06:16.930 --> 06:17.970
These are really good.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.730
You know, whenever I make
waffles, I usually make...

06:19.760 --> 06:20.840
Fried chicken?

06:22.030 --> 06:23.710
Good thing,
I've been going to the gym.

06:26.490 --> 06:28.170
Seems like everybody
really loves your cooking.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.390
Among other things, huh?

06:31.010 --> 06:32.370
Okay. Well, um...

06:32.460 --> 06:34.150
Thanks for keeping
everybody well-fed, Jilly,

06:34.180 --> 06:36.730
But I think I'll just
take it from here.

06:38.670 --> 06:39.950
All right, we're confirmed.

06:39.980 --> 06:43.000
That development team from Austin is
coming here for dinner tomorrow night.

06:43.030 --> 06:44.590
Excellent!
Any thoughts on the menu?

06:44.620 --> 06:46.210
How about chicken pot pie?

06:48.160 --> 06:51.340
Sorry. I just got so used to cooking for
Josh, I thought he was talking to me.

06:51.530 --> 06:53.800
No, he was talking to me,
'cause, you know, I'm the chef.

06:55.420 --> 06:57.840
Of course you are, but I don't see
why Jilly can't make the dinner.

06:57.870 --> 06:59.860
Because it's my job
to cook the dinner?

06:59.950 --> 07:01.500
But, you've been
gone for three weeks.

07:02.020 --> 07:03.240
Well, what does that mean?

07:03.340 --> 07:04.730
You know,
things changed a little bit.

07:04.760 --> 07:07.920
Since you went on vacation with your
boyfriend to China for three weeks.

07:09.310 --> 07:10.360
But, you said I could go.

07:10.390 --> 07:12.050
I said you could go
because you asked me.

07:12.420 --> 07:13.530
Okay, but now I'm back.

07:13.560 --> 07:15.130
And now I have a girlfriend,
and she likes to cook.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.690
So, if she wants to make
the dinner, she can.

07:16.720 --> 07:18.080
Aww, thanks, baby.

07:20.070 --> 07:21.070
Fun.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.690
Why can't you date
somebody who can do my job?

07:31.720 --> 07:33.680
You are never gonna believe
what Josh just told me.

07:33.710 --> 07:35.440
Oh, thank God, finally!

07:36.600 --> 07:37.720
You know?

07:38.300 --> 07:41.790
I know that it's something big,
and that I don't know it.

07:41.820 --> 07:43.860
So, tell me.

07:44.620 --> 07:46.170
Josh is having a business
dinner tomorrow night,

07:46.200 --> 07:48.510
and Jilly wants to cook it,
and he's letting her.

07:48.540 --> 07:50.960
That's what this is about?
Jilly?

07:50.990 --> 07:53.100
Yeah, can't you see?
She's moving in on my territory!

07:53.130 --> 07:56.540
With her sweet buns and that
adorable accent, argh, I hate her!

07:57.830 --> 08:00.470
Your territory?
I thought you were over Josh?

08:00.500 --> 08:02.050
You picked Cooper.
You're happy with Cooper.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.820
Yes, I am happy with Cooper
and I'm glad I picked Cooper,

08:04.850 --> 08:06.720
I'm just not glad that
Josh picked Jilly.

08:06.750 --> 08:08.870
I mean, she's trying
to take over my job!

08:08.900 --> 08:12.120
Oh, my God. Well,
I want to hear all about it.

08:13.350 --> 08:16.570
But first, can you take your shoes
off and put them on the new shoe rack?

08:17.370 --> 08:19.220
I started it while
you were gone, so...

08:19.630 --> 08:21.810
God, has everything
changed since I left?

08:21.840 --> 08:24.060
Okay, seriously, Gabi. Shoes.

08:24.380 --> 08:25.610
I mean, I'm gone three weeks,

08:25.640 --> 08:28.400
and Josh has a girlfriend,
and you have a shoe rack.

08:29.360 --> 08:31.220
Okay, it is just one dinner.

08:31.250 --> 08:33.010
No. No, no, no.

08:33.039 --> 08:34.919
First it's one dinner,
then it's two,

08:34.950 --> 08:37.460
then it's bye-bye Gabi, and she's
cooking for him all the time!

08:37.490 --> 08:39.080
This is a gateway dinner!

08:41.150 --> 08:44.120
Well, you are cracked out on jet
lag, and you need some sleep.

08:44.150 --> 08:45.710
No. No, you know what I need?

08:45.740 --> 08:48.650
I need to roll Jilly up in a
carpet and toss her off a bridge!

08:49.740 --> 08:50.830
Yes, now I hear it.

08:52.440 --> 08:53.610
I am cracked out on jet lag.

08:53.640 --> 08:55.960
I'm gonna call Cooper,
and take a little nap.

08:59.260 --> 09:01.360
Hey, Gabi, could you, um...
take your...

09:03.960 --> 09:05.020
Thank you.

09:16.080 --> 09:17.440
You okay, sugar?

09:17.860 --> 09:18.930
I'm sorry.

09:19.550 --> 09:21.140
Just having a hard
time sleeping.

09:21.710 --> 09:23.000
I know what's going on.

09:23.100 --> 09:24.050
Though, I'm afraid to say it

09:24.080 --> 09:26.710
because I don't want you to
think I'm insecure. But...

09:27.910 --> 09:29.280
I'm insecure.

09:30.460 --> 09:31.630
You?

09:32.200 --> 09:33.610
What are you insecure about?

09:33.640 --> 09:35.510
The truth is,
it's only been three weeks,

09:35.540 --> 09:39.260
and I just feel like you
might still be hung up on her.

09:40.610 --> 09:42.590
Trust me. I'm over her.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.350
She's moved on, I've moved on.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.770
It's okay to say her name.

09:48.860 --> 09:51.340
Your ex-fiancée Caroline.

09:53.850 --> 09:54.970
Caroline?

09:55.680 --> 09:57.850
Yes. Caroline.

09:57.880 --> 10:00.430
That's who I'm over. Very over.

10:00.880 --> 10:03.230
From now on,
it's just the two of us.

10:07.100 --> 10:09.120
And whoever's trying
to break in downstairs.

10:32.080 --> 10:35.360
Gabi, what are you doing here?
It's 3:00 in the morning.

10:35.390 --> 10:36.610
Not in China.

10:37.490 --> 10:41.460
And, you know what they say, the
early bird gets to cook the bird.

10:42.020 --> 10:42.740
Right?

10:42.770 --> 10:43.830
No one says that.

10:45.270 --> 10:46.610
We've discussed this.

10:46.790 --> 10:48.780
My girlfriend is
cooking the dinner.

10:49.270 --> 10:50.480
Your "girlfriend."

10:51.560 --> 10:52.490
Why did you put my
girlfriend in quotes?

10:52.520 --> 10:54.320
Why did you put my
girlfriend in quotes?

10:55.310 --> 10:57.740
I don't know, Josh, maybe because
three weeks ago you were engaged,

10:57.770 --> 10:58.970
and now you have a...

11:00.810 --> 11:03.670
First of all, this is none of
your business, you are my chef.

11:03.700 --> 11:05.940
If I am your chef, then I
should be making the dinner.

11:05.970 --> 11:06.900
Kind of looks like you
are making the dinner.

11:06.930 --> 11:08.850
I am? Oh, thank you!

11:09.610 --> 11:10.510
She is?

11:10.540 --> 11:11.860
No, she's not.

11:11.890 --> 11:13.120
She's going home.

11:13.250 --> 11:14.500
We're going to bed.

11:15.240 --> 11:16.700
Sweetie,
just give me one second.

11:16.730 --> 11:17.810
I'll be up in a jiff.

11:20.550 --> 11:22.710
Hon, I'm sorry that
I worried you so much

11:22.740 --> 11:24.320
you felt like you had
to come over here.

11:24.470 --> 11:26.640
But, here's the thing. Josh and
I are in a new relationship,

11:26.670 --> 11:28.870
and I think he may be a little
hung up on his ex still,

11:28.900 --> 11:31.840
so I'm using every biscuit
in my basket to win him over.

11:31.870 --> 11:33.320
You understand, right?

11:33.350 --> 11:35.000
I do, yeah, I totally do.

11:35.030 --> 11:37.950
But, here's my thing:
I need this job.

11:38.330 --> 11:40.600
Well,
appears we have a situation.

11:40.730 --> 11:42.210
Appears we do.

11:43.630 --> 11:45.350
How do you suggest
we remedy that?

11:45.940 --> 11:48.330
Well, how about we
both cook the dinner

11:48.360 --> 11:50.430
and we see which one
Josh likes the best.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.360
If you're asking for a cook-off,
you got one.

11:52.390 --> 11:57.080
Okay, well, if I win, then I cook the
dinner, and you stay out of my kitchen.

11:57.110 --> 12:00.890
And if I win, I cook the dinner, and
any other dinner I want to from now on.

12:00.990 --> 12:01.960
In Josh's kitchen.

12:01.990 --> 12:03.510
- Game on!
- So on!

12:04.250 --> 12:05.790
Let's wait till
the sun comes up.

12:05.820 --> 12:07.230
- Good idea.
- Okay.

12:11.750 --> 12:13.620
Ooh,
something smells good in here.

12:13.650 --> 12:14.980
Thank you.

12:15.010 --> 12:16.620
She was talking to me!

12:17.750 --> 12:19.140
Crazy white girls.

12:20.550 --> 12:21.800
Look at you.

12:21.890 --> 12:24.230
I don't know who's working
harder, you or those spanx.

12:26.390 --> 12:27.710
The spanx.

12:27.740 --> 12:31.370
I am one popcorn shrimp away from
blowing a button and killing the man.

12:32.650 --> 12:36.520
I still don't know how you got a date
with the world's sexiest window washer.

12:37.130 --> 12:38.190
We have a connection.

12:38.220 --> 12:40.910
We were able to communicate
with just our hands.

12:56.190 --> 12:58.210
Oh, that's cute, window man.

12:58.260 --> 13:00.730
But,
let's talk with our voices now.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.690
We can talk with
our hands later.

13:04.360 --> 13:06.090
You know I'm deaf, right?

13:13.060 --> 13:14.060
No.

13:14.600 --> 13:15.910
No, I did not.

13:17.560 --> 13:18.960
Hold on.

13:21.770 --> 13:23.170
He's deaf. What do I do?

13:23.750 --> 13:25.490
Go out with him. He's hot.

13:25.520 --> 13:27.600
But, I've never been out
with a deaf guy before.

13:27.650 --> 13:30.060
So? You've never been out
with a hot guy before.

13:32.740 --> 13:34.280
How are we supposed
to communicate?

13:34.890 --> 13:36.620
Why are we whispering?
He can't hear us.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.820
I can read lips, mamacita.

13:42.660 --> 13:45.460
Well, look at that, you finally
have a date who can read.

13:51.730 --> 13:54.020
Here's the research on the
guys coming to dinner tonight.

13:54.240 --> 13:55.540
Only one of them is cute.

13:56.720 --> 13:59.580
Did you figure out a way to make sure
I pick Jilly's pie over Gabi's pie?

13:59.920 --> 14:02.240
Can we please stop
talking about their pies?

14:02.270 --> 14:03.850
It's making me dry heave.

14:04.310 --> 14:05.420
I'm serious.

14:05.920 --> 14:07.160
I need to pick Jilly's.

14:07.660 --> 14:11.480
It's easy. Jilly's using the aubergine
ramekin, Gabi's using the chartreuse.

14:13.140 --> 14:14.520
Can you say that
again in hetero?

14:15.550 --> 14:18.000
Jilly's purple, Gabi's green.

14:19.250 --> 14:21.260
And a ramekin's a
small dish you bake in.

14:21.290 --> 14:22.310
Gotcha.

14:23.020 --> 14:24.700
Why does it matter who wins?

14:24.860 --> 14:26.700
Because Jilly's starting
to feel insecure.

14:26.760 --> 14:28.270
She's worried that
I'm not over Gabi.

14:28.450 --> 14:30.800
Caroline. She's worried
I'm not over Caroline.

14:31.430 --> 14:33.430
So, I have to pick Jilly's pie
to prove that I'm into Gabi.

14:33.460 --> 14:35.460
Jilly! I'm into Jilly!
Jilly, Jilly!

14:37.150 --> 14:38.310
Who's green again?

14:40.850 --> 14:42.540
Okay,
first we have to blindfold you.

14:42.570 --> 14:44.700
No. Why do I have
to be blindfolded?

14:44.730 --> 14:46.100
Didn't seem to bother
you last night.

14:46.130 --> 14:47.610
This is so not that.

14:48.760 --> 14:50.200
Okay, here we go.

14:57.620 --> 14:58.740
So good.

15:01.580 --> 15:02.700
And, number two.

15:11.170 --> 15:12.760
Also delicious.

15:13.540 --> 15:15.120
So, which do you choose?

15:16.090 --> 15:16.940
Which one do I choose?

15:16.970 --> 15:18.280
Just pick one!

15:19.970 --> 15:21.020
Fine.

15:21.570 --> 15:24.090
I... pick...

15:24.900 --> 15:25.770
the first one.

15:25.800 --> 15:26.550
- That's mine.
- What?

15:26.580 --> 15:28.490
I won!
I beat a professional chef.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.200
You picked mine, sweetie!

15:30.230 --> 15:31.240
Thank god.

15:32.130 --> 15:33.750
Well, congrats.
You won fair and square.

15:33.780 --> 15:36.200
Chin up, Gabi. There's no
shame in being runner-up.

15:36.230 --> 15:37.420
Or so I've been told.

15:39.240 --> 15:40.350
Gabi, wait.

15:41.620 --> 15:42.640
Here.

15:42.920 --> 15:43.700
Take one of my pies.

15:43.730 --> 15:46.110
It looks like you could use
a little bit of comfort food.

15:47.610 --> 15:48.750
Thanks.

15:55.900 --> 15:58.740
You're back early.
It didn't work out?

15:58.940 --> 16:00.720
No, it did not.

16:00.750 --> 16:03.220
Well, maybe next time you
should date a blind guy.

16:05.870 --> 16:07.140
What happened?

16:10.460 --> 16:13.080
When the check came,
he wanted to go dutch.

16:13.460 --> 16:16.370
I can't blame him.
I've seen how much you can eat.

16:21.580 --> 16:24.610
And then, he paid for his half
with a two-for-one coupon.

16:26.790 --> 16:30.060
You gotta dump his cheap,
but well-sculpted ass.

16:31.060 --> 16:33.800
I can't. He'll think I'm
prejudiced against the deaf.

16:33.830 --> 16:35.900
But, I'm just prejudiced
against the cheap.

16:37.210 --> 16:39.770
Yeah. If a man wants your milk,

16:39.800 --> 16:43.380
he's gotta buy the whole cow.

16:54.750 --> 16:57.750
Except for no-dairy Gary,
I'd say dinner was a hit.

16:57.780 --> 16:59.410
I'd say you were a hit.

17:00.700 --> 17:02.270
I like the music you picked.

17:02.330 --> 17:03.800
Really? Let's turn it up.

17:11.460 --> 17:12.849
May I have this dance, m'lady?

17:18.470 --> 17:20.829
Aww, handsome, and he can dance.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.290
Wait till thriller comes on.

17:23.310 --> 17:25.069
Hey,
gabi I'm calling you from...

17:25.099 --> 17:26.910
- No, no, no, no!
- The airport, actually.

17:26.940 --> 17:28.180
Last night,
after I called off my wedding,

17:28.210 --> 17:29.660
- Wrong song.
- You're the one I wanted to see.

17:29.690 --> 17:31.360
- This is...
- I even drove to your house

17:31.390 --> 17:33.880
and climbed up your fire escape
with roses to...

17:41.090 --> 17:42.470
So, where were we?

17:43.520 --> 17:45.080
- Oh, my god!
- No, I can explain!

17:45.110 --> 17:47.770
It's not Caroline you're
still hung up on, it's Gabi.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.840
No! No, no, no, no.
Okay, no, no, no.

17:51.040 --> 17:52.180
You don't understand.

17:52.230 --> 17:55.500
The reason why that's on my laptop,
is because I took it off her phone.

17:55.530 --> 17:57.720
See, I didn't want her to listen to
it because I'm so happy with you.

17:57.750 --> 17:59.450
So, you don't have
feelings for Gabi?

18:02.270 --> 18:03.370
That's what I thought.

18:03.870 --> 18:08.220
Josh, you are adorable and a good
man, But I am never runner-up.

18:08.600 --> 18:09.570
Don't go.

18:09.600 --> 18:10.740
I'll be fine.

18:11.330 --> 18:12.500
Goodbye, Josh.

18:13.720 --> 18:15.400
Goodbye, Gabi. Jilly!

18:24.260 --> 18:25.690
I could be a valet parker.

18:26.140 --> 18:28.330
Really? Can you drive a stick?

18:28.530 --> 18:29.620
No.

18:29.700 --> 18:31.220
Can you parallel park?

18:31.350 --> 18:31.960
No.

18:31.990 --> 18:33.520
Then, can you be a valet parker?

18:33.550 --> 18:34.810
No.

18:36.390 --> 18:38.850
God, what happened?
Everything was so perfect.

18:38.880 --> 18:43.160
I had an amazing time in China, I had
a great time with Cooper, I had a job.

18:43.590 --> 18:45.880
hey, Gabi, it's Josh,
I need to talk to you.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.680
Go ahead.
Get it over with quick.

18:55.710 --> 18:56.950
I'm fired, right?

18:57.300 --> 18:58.340
You're not fired.

18:58.370 --> 19:00.380
How could you not fire me?
I would fire me!

19:00.410 --> 19:03.040
I can't even cook a pot
pie better than a civilian.

19:03.340 --> 19:05.040
Gabi, stop.

19:05.270 --> 19:06.500
I picked hers on purpose.

19:06.530 --> 19:08.060
Nice try.
It was a blind taste test.

19:08.090 --> 19:09.080
And I knew which one was yours.

19:09.110 --> 19:11.050
- How?
- Bacon in the crust.

19:11.890 --> 19:13.190
Signature Gabi move.

19:13.830 --> 19:16.640
Also, no onions,
'cause I hate them.

19:16.960 --> 19:18.540
Extra peas, 'cause I love them.

19:19.130 --> 19:20.320
You did know.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.190
Well,
then why did you pick hers?

19:24.280 --> 19:25.690
For the sex reasons.

19:27.660 --> 19:31.110
I just really wanted things
to work out with Jilly.

19:31.140 --> 19:32.820
What do you mean "Wanted"?
What happened?

19:33.240 --> 19:34.080
We broke up.

19:34.110 --> 19:35.440
What! Why?

19:36.830 --> 19:38.580
She didn't like my music.

19:40.230 --> 19:43.770
And I also think that maybe it
was a little too soon for me

19:43.800 --> 19:45.490
to have a "girlfriend."

19:45.520 --> 19:46.930
Aww, Josh.

19:46.960 --> 19:50.070
Someday, you're gonna find a girlfriend
you don't have to put quotes around.

19:50.560 --> 19:52.220
I mean, somebody who's
incredible for you,

19:52.250 --> 19:55.500
who totally gets you, and who,
hopefully, can't cook.

19:57.180 --> 19:58.370
- You think so?
- Yeah.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.400
You're gonna find somebody
who's perfect for you.

20:01.320 --> 20:02.610
Just like me and Cooper.

20:03.650 --> 20:04.810
Just like you and Cooper.

20:04.840 --> 20:05.980
Yeah.

20:08.600 --> 20:11.670
Hey, do you want to see pictures
of my trip to China with Cooper?

20:12.040 --> 20:13.190
Not even a little.

20:18.910 --> 20:21.140
Okay,
I just finished my breakup text.

20:21.370 --> 20:22.650
How does this sound?

20:23.090 --> 20:27.430
George, it was really nice to
meet you, but I have to be honest,

20:27.460 --> 20:29.140
I have three months to live.

20:30.170 --> 20:34.810
And it will be cruel to give you
so much, only to take it away.

20:36.640 --> 20:38.430
It's good, really really good.

20:39.850 --> 20:41.820
So you don't think
he'll be too crushed?

20:42.640 --> 20:45.450
Uhhh...
no, I think he'll be okay.
