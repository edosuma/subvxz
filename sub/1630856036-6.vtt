WEBVTT

01:10.195 --> 01:13.198
I'm calling us the winners. Joint winners.

01:13.198 --> 01:15.534
Joint snowball champions.

01:15.534 --> 01:19.079
- Look who's arrived.
- Yes. Here I am.

01:19.580 --> 01:20.622
Your Grace.

01:20.622 --> 01:24.626
Delighted you could make it.
And did you arrive with--

01:24.626 --> 01:29.339
Finally, the fun's here.
I see Guy's looking after you.

01:29.339 --> 01:31.175
We're looking after each other.

01:31.842 --> 01:33.177
Welcome, both of you.

01:34.136 --> 01:37.014
Does Mother know you're here?

01:47.399 --> 01:49.651
And thank you
for taking care of my best man.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.237
Is that what I am?

01:52.237 --> 01:53.780
Well, I hope so.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.866
Who else would do it?
My mother in a tailcoat?

01:57.743 --> 01:59.912
Come here. Thank you.

02:01.246 --> 02:05.417
Right. It's Christmas Eve.
Let's spend it with the ones we love most.

03:09.773 --> 03:11.483
Are any of them actually alive in there?

03:14.069 --> 03:16.905
You know, Miles is funny and charming.

03:16.905 --> 03:20.242
And he has that penniless second-son-thing
of having to marry money.

03:20.242 --> 03:21.910
That's exactly what I look for.

03:24.079 --> 03:26.331
You know,
Mother will haul us home next month

03:26.331 --> 03:28.083
if you're still horrifyingly unmarried.

03:28.083 --> 03:31.879
It's Christmas.
It's no time to think about home.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.422
And if you wanna stay so badly,

03:33.422 --> 03:34.798
why don't you marry him?

03:36.133 --> 03:37.134
I love you!

03:37.634 --> 03:40.345
You know they're waiting to see
if we get into an argument?

03:40.345 --> 03:43.098
Can nobody understand "amicably apart"?

03:43.098 --> 03:47.060
Should we just pretend
to get into a fight, for the drama?

03:47.728 --> 03:48.979
I could grab your hair.

03:51.273 --> 03:54.109
I'm sorry. I didn't-- I didn't--
I didn't mean it like that.

03:56.195 --> 03:59.072
I think we both know who likes
to have their hair pulled, Dicky.

04:04.453 --> 04:06.413
Mabel!

04:06.413 --> 04:07.331
No!

04:35.901 --> 04:37.110
I love you, Jinny.

04:38.862 --> 04:39.905
I love you.

04:43.492 --> 04:44.910
Sounds like Conchita.

04:48.247 --> 04:50.541
I wish we could spend Christmas
on our own.

04:53.085 --> 04:54.211
With your friends...

04:56.463 --> 04:58.131
sometimes you're not as easy to love.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.509
I'm sorry. I--

05:00.509 --> 05:01.635
Jinny.

05:02.845 --> 05:03.846
Only us.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.142
Only us. Always.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.396
Now...

05:14.940 --> 05:16.191
what are you gonna wear?

05:33.625 --> 05:36.253
Round off the edges,
and don't leave yourself undefended.

05:38.380 --> 05:39.631
Snowballing.

05:41.091 --> 05:43.594
Vital to have rules, as so often in life.

05:45.262 --> 05:46.763
If your gloves need drying...

06:04.698 --> 06:05.699
May I?

06:09.578 --> 06:11.830
They say a glove

06:13.207 --> 06:15.626
can be a useful tool for communication.

06:18.629 --> 06:19.630
"I'm engaged."

06:25.052 --> 06:26.178
"I wish I were with you."

06:30.891 --> 06:32.309
"Would you pass me those nuts?"

06:39.358 --> 06:40.359
Yeah.

06:41.068 --> 06:44.655
I prefer speaking plainly
rather than in code.

06:44.655 --> 06:45.948
Take plenty.

06:45.948 --> 06:48.492
Christmas is a time
for keeping our families tight

06:48.492 --> 06:49.910
and our corsets loose.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.580
I barely fasten mine.

06:54.248 --> 06:56.458
What a pleasure
to have you with us this year.

06:56.458 --> 07:01.338
Of course, Theodore is only truly happy
near his beach and studio,

07:01.338 --> 07:03.465
in what I call "extravagant isolation."

07:04.925 --> 07:06.260
Though somehow this year,

07:06.260 --> 07:08.929
despite Scotland being a very long way
from Cornwall,

07:08.929 --> 07:12.391
there's a smile on his face,
which I can only assume is down to you.

07:13.475 --> 07:16.603
One Christmas,
he set up his new train set under his bed,

07:16.603 --> 07:18.605
and we didn't see him for three days.

07:18.605 --> 07:21.358
The servants had to leave plates
of food for him, like a cat.

07:23.569 --> 07:24.611
He was 23.

07:31.326 --> 07:32.536
Six or seven, I believe.

07:33.537 --> 07:35.247
Best Christmas of his life,
he's always said.

07:35.831 --> 07:37.165
Till this year, I suspect.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.544
You've pleased him more
than I could ever have imagined.

07:40.544 --> 07:42.045
He pleases me too.

07:43.338 --> 07:47.467
I mean, we just-- We--
We enjoy each other's company.

07:54.183 --> 07:56.768
And what shall we call our snow child?

07:56.768 --> 07:59.188
- He looks like a lord.
- Lord Snowman.

07:59.188 --> 08:01.190
That's his name.

08:01.190 --> 08:02.941
I think we make a pretty good team,
you and I.

08:02.941 --> 08:04.276
Jinny! Come play with us!

08:04.276 --> 08:08.989
- Faster. Come on. Giddyup. What is this?
- I'm not weak.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.033
- Come on.
- What is this, Lizzy?

08:11.533 --> 08:15.329
- I'm not weak.
- Come on. Faster!

08:15.329 --> 08:19.333
Come on. Giddyup, Lizzy. Come on.

08:19.333 --> 08:22.085
- Jinny, come play with us!
- Jinny's here.

08:22.085 --> 08:26.215
Where have you been hiding? Come on.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.304
Lizzy.

08:33.722 --> 08:35.307
Why don't you get on, and I'll pull you.

08:35.307 --> 08:36.933
You've got the strength of an ant.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.809
Are you okay?

08:38.809 --> 08:41.897
- Yeah. It's all right. I'm fine.
- I'm so sorry. Let me help you get up.

08:41.897 --> 08:44.441
- I'm so sorry. Are you sure?
- I said-- I'm fine, really. Yeah.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.653
- No... ...I-I-I--
- Oof.

08:49.154 --> 08:51.031
No, I don't need any-- any help. I'm--

08:53.450 --> 08:55.410
Wow.

08:55.410 --> 08:59.623
Look how big and strong your husband is, Jinny.

09:03.001 --> 09:05.128
You're so...

09:29.820 --> 09:31.113
All that Jinny wants,

09:32.447 --> 09:33.490
all we both want,

09:34.491 --> 09:36.535
is to have a wonderful
first Christmas together.

09:38.370 --> 09:42.541
And I know she'd feel very upset
if there was any kind of fuss.

09:45.460 --> 09:46.461
Don't you think?

10:45.646 --> 10:47.231
I was hoping to see you earlier.

10:47.731 --> 10:50.192
Yes, I thought during all
that snowballing and whooping

10:50.192 --> 10:52.069
you were probably really looking for me.

10:57.866 --> 11:02.913
That evening, after we'd been
at the boathouse, I was awful.

11:03.497 --> 11:05.165
I'm so sorry. My mouth sometimes--

11:05.165 --> 11:07.084
I don't know anything about your mouth.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.461
Well, I feel terrible.

11:10.671 --> 11:12.840
- I-I shouldn't have--
- It was entirely new for me.

11:15.843 --> 11:16.844
What happened.

11:18.512 --> 11:19.513
What we did.

11:22.432 --> 11:23.433
What I felt.

11:25.269 --> 11:27.521
All of it. It was all new.

11:28.105 --> 11:31.191
And I'm so sorry that I...

11:33.235 --> 11:34.069
I felt it too.

11:39.283 --> 11:40.284
Happy Christmas.

11:48.333 --> 11:49.334
It's a silly--

11:50.502 --> 11:51.503
Probably.

11:55.799 --> 11:58.802
The two of them, they reminded me of--

12:00.596 --> 12:05.934
I-I mean they do not do what we did,
those two. Not even slightly.

12:06.810 --> 12:08.687
Which is bad luck for them, actually.

12:09.188 --> 12:14.443
But that would be
a different kind of music box.

12:15.777 --> 12:19.990
I just--
The way they seemed to be together...

12:25.412 --> 12:26.788
Anyway...

12:30.751 --> 12:32.878
Lizzy and I
will have to go back to New York soon.

12:34.046 --> 12:37.007
And actually,
I've thought of a way to stay,

12:37.007 --> 12:40.010
but in case my plan doesn't work out...

12:40.010 --> 12:42.179
Good luck, Honoria.

12:47.100 --> 12:51.188
You remember we were playing
sardines, looking for Mabel?

12:51.897 --> 12:54.191
It was a time when Seadown was--

12:56.485 --> 12:57.778
He was very focused on me.

12:59.655 --> 13:03.158
We went into a bedroom to look,
and I thought--

13:03.158 --> 13:04.660
You went into a bedroom?

13:08.956 --> 13:10.290
He told me to undress.

13:11.375 --> 13:12.376
So I did.

13:14.920 --> 13:15.921
I was naked.

13:18.382 --> 13:19.591
I lay on a bed.

13:21.176 --> 13:23.262
I didn't know what I was supposed to do.

13:29.601 --> 13:30.602
What did he do?

13:33.146 --> 13:34.606
After a while, he left.

13:41.530 --> 13:44.950
He sent in a servant
to tell me that he wasn't coming back.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.622
I was humiliated.

13:51.915 --> 13:56.879
Which was the idea, I suppose.
To make me feel worthless. And it worked.

14:00.465 --> 14:02.426
I wanted to be alone with him, I think.

14:04.178 --> 14:07.347
Perhaps, I even wanted to kiss him.

14:09.725 --> 14:11.101
I was so ashamed.

14:14.771 --> 14:17.232
Why-- Why are you telling me this now?

14:20.194 --> 14:21.278
I'm worried about you.

14:25.908 --> 14:28.785
You said yourself that he sometimes
wants you to be something that you're not.

14:28.785 --> 14:32.956
- No, stop saying it. Stop it.
- I know. I know you wanted a husband.

14:32.956 --> 14:35.876
- We were both told to want that endlessly.
- No. I love him.

14:35.876 --> 14:37.628
- Okay, it's not just--
- But I don't think

14:37.628 --> 14:41.131
that he loves you
the way that you hope to be loved.

14:46.845 --> 14:50.516
So you're not saying
that James forced you into that room?

14:52.601 --> 14:55.771
Did he force you to take your clothes off?

14:57.356 --> 14:58.774
Did he rip off your dress?

14:59.441 --> 15:00.734
Did he push you onto the bed?

15:02.319 --> 15:03.487
That's not what I said.

15:04.321 --> 15:06.406
He didn't make you do anything.

15:07.032 --> 15:10.202
And when you undressed, he left,
like a gentleman.

15:11.537 --> 15:15.082
Lizzy, if you regret debasing yourself,
well, that's hardly James's fault.

15:15.624 --> 15:17.417
But he is my husband.

15:18.460 --> 15:21.797
He chose me, and I will always choose him.

15:37.229 --> 15:38.355
Wakey-wakey.

15:38.856 --> 15:40.691
Who doesn't enjoy a Christmas nap?

15:41.525 --> 15:42.526
Essential.

15:44.361 --> 15:45.404
Thank you.

15:47.239 --> 15:50.117
For being here.
And for looking after everything.

15:55.414 --> 15:58.584
Here's my girl.

15:59.251 --> 16:00.794
My little treasure.

16:00.794 --> 16:02.212
There's my girl.

17:03.190 --> 17:04.023
Wrong room?

17:12.366 --> 17:17.954
I've been trying to learn
how to be less reserved.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.166
You are not reserved.

17:24.586 --> 17:26.672
Perhaps, I'm riddled with secret shyness.

17:27.172 --> 17:30.551
I saw your knickers
before I saw your face.

17:33.804 --> 17:35.055
Honoria.

17:37.015 --> 17:40.102
Is there, perhaps,
a man who's caught your eye?

17:41.019 --> 17:42.020
No, there's no man.

17:45.190 --> 17:46.191
You know,

17:46.775 --> 17:52.906
confidence is not just ribbons
or flowers in your hair.

17:54.283 --> 17:58.620
There's a kind of glow
that comes with understanding yourself.

17:59.246 --> 18:00.789
Which I believe you have.

18:02.374 --> 18:04.668
And it's absolutely beautiful.

18:10.799 --> 18:12.342
And underwear helps, of course, too.

18:12.342 --> 18:14.761
Fantastic underwear.

18:32.070 --> 18:36.283
You know, Richard is unhappy
all the time without you.

18:40.412 --> 18:42.331
Well, we're both entirely miserable.

18:45.709 --> 18:49.713
But he could have me back in an instant
if only he chose to let go.

18:51.173 --> 18:52.174
Of what?

18:52.925 --> 18:54.343
Whatever's holding him back.

19:14.404 --> 19:17.574
I was just eating a walnut.

19:20.744 --> 19:21.870
I'm happy for you.

19:26.583 --> 19:29.211
- And I've got mulled wine.
- Big day.

19:56.113 --> 19:58.198
- I'm here with Theo.
- Your fiancé.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.616
And you're here with Jean.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.119
Have you brought me in here
to confirm the facts?

20:02.744 --> 20:04.580
I don't wanna talk about what happened
when we--

20:04.580 --> 20:06.623
Well, let's not then. Absolutely.

20:24.850 --> 20:27.477
Sometimes I feel very panicked
about the idea

20:27.477 --> 20:30.063
of trying to fit the whole world
into one lifetime.

20:32.357 --> 20:33.567
Do you know what I mean?

20:48.332 --> 20:49.708
I had one of these.

20:53.128 --> 20:55.380
I put pins in every place
I wanted to visit.

20:59.426 --> 21:00.928
And where do you wanna go now?

21:08.393 --> 21:09.770
A million places.

21:14.107 --> 21:17.528
But recently,
I can only concentrate on one of them.

21:22.783 --> 21:23.867
I want to make clear...

21:26.119 --> 21:27.162
before we met,

21:28.914 --> 21:32.209
I did think, briefly,
a rich bride might be the answer.

21:34.211 --> 21:35.295
To save the house.

21:38.090 --> 21:40.384
Perhaps, like a fool,
I thought it might save my mother.

21:45.389 --> 21:46.890
But that was before I met you.

21:49.142 --> 21:52.604
Nan, when I met you,
it was immediately, entirely real.

22:02.614 --> 22:05.868
In any case, our house is gone.

22:10.414 --> 22:11.415
My mother's gone.

22:15.961 --> 22:19.548
And the telegram? The lost telegram.

22:22.050 --> 22:23.051
What did it say?

22:31.894 --> 22:32.978
It said...

22:35.189 --> 22:39.943
"Enjoy your trip with your fiancé. And,
perhaps, I'll see you one of these days."

22:43.572 --> 22:45.240
Well, Jean seems really lovely.

22:46.783 --> 22:48.243
She really is, in fact.

22:50.287 --> 22:51.788
Yeah, she's full of surprises.

22:53.207 --> 22:54.917
And I hear her family has money.

22:54.917 --> 22:58.879
So, perhaps,
your wish might come true after all.

23:01.798 --> 23:03.217
Theo will be looking for me.

23:10.224 --> 23:12.017
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:13.185 --> 23:15.521
Look how strong you are.

23:15.521 --> 23:16.939
- Yes.
- Hey.

23:16.939 --> 23:20.359
- Sorry. It's your turn. I-I can leave.
- No, stay.

23:27.449 --> 23:29.701
You know, Minnie adores this ball.

23:30.202 --> 23:31.203
Look.

23:31.703 --> 23:33.872
What's that? What's that?

23:33.872 --> 23:36.166
- She loves it. I don't know why.
- It's her favorite ball.

23:36.166 --> 23:38.627
- It's her favorite ball.
- No, you can't eat it.

23:39.211 --> 23:40.921
Minnie, Minnie. Minnie, careful.

23:47.010 --> 23:49.596
- Good girl!
- Well done.

24:01.066 --> 24:02.484
I like your flower, Lady Honoria.

24:10.200 --> 24:12.119
It must feel strange, Miss Testvalley,

24:13.412 --> 24:16.039
to spend every Christmas
with someone else's family.

24:18.250 --> 24:21.170
Well, that's the job.

24:22.796 --> 24:24.590
And I pride myself
on being more than simply--

24:24.590 --> 24:27.426
You're indispensable.

24:27.426 --> 24:30.762
You were the only governess
to attempt to teach me French.

24:30.762 --> 24:32.431
<i>Bien sûr.</i>

24:36.101 --> 24:38.353
Not easy to find new horizons
in that house.

24:39.062 --> 24:40.522
But Richard's married now.

24:41.481 --> 24:43.192
He has a real chance at happiness.

24:46.153 --> 24:47.154
And freedom.

24:52.743 --> 24:53.744
Merry Christmas.

25:08.175 --> 25:09.801
Why did you ask me to marry you?

25:14.139 --> 25:18.810
You'd ignored me the previous night
when we were all playing games.

25:18.810 --> 25:22.022
Then-- Then in the morning
you appeared with a ring.

25:24.566 --> 25:26.860
Virginia, I don't find it easy
to show warmth.

25:27.444 --> 25:28.612
You've met my family.

25:30.030 --> 25:34.868
At Runnymede, I was trying to win the hand
of the most beautiful woman in the room.

25:36.620 --> 25:37.621
You make me nervous.

25:41.083 --> 25:42.084
Only you.

25:50.759 --> 25:55.389
I-- I have to say this out loud.

25:58.600 --> 26:03.230
Lizzy said that when we were all
playing games, the two of you...

26:04.398 --> 26:05.816
upstairs...

26:20.372 --> 26:22.916
So, that's it? I'm nothing to you?

26:23.667 --> 26:26.128
James, please.

26:27.004 --> 26:29.047
I told her that I didn't wanna hear it.

26:29.548 --> 26:31.425
I told her that you would never do it.

26:31.925 --> 26:35.137
I told her that I would always choose you
ove-- over anyone.

26:56.325 --> 26:57.993
Have you tried these?

27:02.122 --> 27:03.248
Thank God you're here.

27:03.916 --> 27:05.626
We'd be lost without each other.

27:05.626 --> 27:07.836
The others just don't understand us.

27:07.836 --> 27:10.255
We're free spirits.

27:12.883 --> 27:14.551
Not free for long.

27:15.052 --> 27:17.888
My parents are planning to marry me off
to some rich bore.

27:17.888 --> 27:21.475
If only we could both find spouses
who'd just let us do as we please.

27:22.267 --> 27:23.268
Miles...

27:25.229 --> 27:27.189
Somebody who's a woman.

27:27.189 --> 27:29.066
Florence Nightingale.

27:29.066 --> 27:31.151
- Waiter...
- Pouring...

27:31.151 --> 27:33.529
- a chemist. A scientist.
- ...a doctor...

27:33.529 --> 27:35.781
- bar-- bar-- barman.
- Tea.

27:35.781 --> 27:38.825
- Cup of tea. Me. I'm a window opener.
- Honoria. Honoria...

27:38.825 --> 27:42.162
- Honoria.
- It's Mr. James Bullman.

27:42.162 --> 27:43.705
Who?

27:43.705 --> 27:47.709
Mr. James Bullman,
he delivers the milk to my parents.

27:49.294 --> 27:50.587
If we knew him,

27:50.587 --> 27:52.631
- I'm sure it would have been very good.
- I just--

27:52.631 --> 27:54.299
I didn't know anybody.
He normally delivers...

27:54.299 --> 27:56.802
- Everybody, can I just--
- ...the milk to my parents.

28:03.475 --> 28:07.145
Mabel Elmsworth,
this may be rather sudden.

28:07.145 --> 28:08.605
But, sometimes,

28:09.815 --> 28:14.361
something just comes along
that makes such complete sense.

28:16.947 --> 28:18.115
Will you marry me?

28:19.658 --> 28:22.327
And stay in England as your wife?

28:23.495 --> 28:26.790
That would--
I believe it would be absolutely perfect.

28:31.962 --> 28:33.755
Well done. Just right.

28:37.342 --> 28:39.094
Mabel, what on Earth?

28:39.094 --> 28:42.097
It works for us all.
Now, Mother can't drag us home.

28:42.723 --> 28:43.724
But...

28:44.391 --> 28:48.729
Mabel, you don't actually--
You don't love him.

28:49.354 --> 28:51.899
No. I mean, no more than he loves me.

28:52.399 --> 28:55.527
But which married couple
can honestly say they're in love?

29:43.617 --> 29:45.118
Could you bear it?

29:45.786 --> 29:46.995
Waiting all that time.

29:46.995 --> 29:49.331
I mean, it's practically Boxing Day.

29:49.331 --> 29:50.541
Happy Christmas.

29:59.550 --> 30:00.676
It's cheese.

30:03.095 --> 30:07.182
You are a very surprising woman.

30:10.769 --> 30:12.729
I've been dreading Christmas this year.

30:13.522 --> 30:15.649
You've made it so much--

30:17.818 --> 30:19.903
Would you like to go for a ride tomorrow?

30:21.280 --> 30:24.741
Miss Christmas lunch
and avoid the madness.

30:25.701 --> 30:27.828
I'd like that very much.

30:29.955 --> 30:32.791
- Will you bring your cheese?
- Cheese is the main event.

30:45.888 --> 30:46.889
James?

30:50.642 --> 30:51.643
James?

30:53.854 --> 30:55.022
James, I'm so sorry.

31:11.163 --> 31:12.164
What can I do?

31:15.918 --> 31:19.505
All I ever do is make you quite certain
of my devotion to you.

31:20.297 --> 31:24.635
I trust you. With everything in my life,
you are my life. I have no secrets.

31:25.469 --> 31:26.678
Can you say the same?

31:28.472 --> 31:31.683
It's hurtful that you never give me cause
to believe you trust me.

31:31.683 --> 31:35.187
I do. I do trust you. I choose you.

31:35.187 --> 31:37.397
Yet, you hang on to these childish notions

31:37.397 --> 31:39.775
of being a sister, and a daughter,
and a friend,

31:39.775 --> 31:41.985
whispering with them about God knows what.

31:43.987 --> 31:45.614
How do I know you truly love me?

31:46.573 --> 31:50.577
Without reservation. How do I know
you value me above all others?

31:53.497 --> 31:54.957
Prove it to me.

31:59.044 --> 32:00.045
Please.

33:02.941 --> 33:04.568
This is how things should be.

33:05.068 --> 33:06.570
I've been waiting for you.

33:08.405 --> 33:11.700
I'm going to be a better man.

33:13.410 --> 33:15.704
I promise. I'll show you.

33:16.246 --> 33:18.332
You just have to show yourself.

33:22.503 --> 33:24.338
Ugh.

33:24.338 --> 33:26.173
Don't answer it.

33:28.342 --> 33:30.344
We have to.

33:30.344 --> 33:31.762
Come in.

33:33.931 --> 33:36.225
- Merry Christmas, Lady Marable.
- Merry Christmas.

33:36.725 --> 33:38.519
Lord Marable.

33:39.102 --> 33:41.146
I've come to say my goodbyes.

33:41.730 --> 33:45.067
I've been offered a position in Cornwall,
which I've accepted.

33:45.651 --> 33:48.195
You're leaving? But it's Christmas Day.

33:48.195 --> 33:50.531
I'm afraid I'm required urgently.

33:51.198 --> 33:52.449
My carriage is being prepared.

33:52.449 --> 33:54.451
What can we do? How can we persuade you--

33:54.451 --> 33:56.411
I'm afraid I'm quite decided,
Lady Marable.

33:56.411 --> 34:00.082
I wish you both good luck, and
I should be glad to have news of you all.

34:01.124 --> 34:03.293
But I think it's time to move on.

34:06.463 --> 34:07.464
For all of us.

34:14.429 --> 34:16.889
Minnie will be dressed and ready
whenever you are.

34:33.782 --> 34:36.243
Your Grace, Merry Christmas.

34:37.119 --> 34:38.620
I hope you've had a really wonderful s--

34:38.620 --> 34:42.373
I'm going to ask you to pack your bags
and leave immediately.

34:43.417 --> 34:45.668
Is this-- Are you--

34:45.668 --> 34:49.130
I've recently been made aware
of your predicament.

34:51.007 --> 34:53.677
Your being the product
of your father's indiscretion.

34:58.807 --> 35:00.893
We'll make it public
your father is unwell,

35:00.893 --> 35:02.686
and you had to return to America.

35:03.896 --> 35:06.064
By next season, I'm quite sure
everyone will have forgotten--

35:06.064 --> 35:08.483
Wait, wait, wait. But how do you--
Who told you?

35:09.109 --> 35:11.945
Theo will be hurt, of course.

35:13.071 --> 35:15.365
But he'll see entirely
your union isn't possible.

35:15.365 --> 35:16.700
But only yesterday you said

35:16.700 --> 35:18.493
how much he loved me
and how much I please him.

35:18.493 --> 35:22.080
This is not about anything
as trivial as love, Annabel.

35:23.457 --> 35:25.125
If you were to marry my son,

35:25.125 --> 35:31.423
you'd destroy 500 years
of civility and sacrifice.

35:32.382 --> 35:36.970
Heredity, I'm afraid, is not one
of those silly games you're fond of.

35:38.096 --> 35:41.058
But no one knows. No one has to know.
We don't have to tell anyone.

35:41.058 --> 35:43.852
I'm as sorry as anyone
that you lied, Annabel.

35:44.853 --> 35:45.979
I know you come from a country

35:45.979 --> 35:48.649
where people aren't burdened
by the rules of propriety,

35:48.649 --> 35:51.902
but in this country, that kind of behavior
is quite inexcusable.

35:55.906 --> 35:57.824
I fully expect not to see you again.

37:09.605 --> 37:10.606
Laura.

37:11.773 --> 37:14.818
Please don't go. Stay.

37:16.028 --> 37:20.115
You're doing a fine job of standing
on your own feet, Lord Richard.

37:22.367 --> 37:23.619
Your own family.

37:25.287 --> 37:27.039
No need for old attachments.

37:27.039 --> 37:31.293
Minnie will miss you terribly.
So will Conchita.

37:34.213 --> 37:36.006
Not a moment of this is about Conchita.

37:36.632 --> 37:41.220
She's just the latest in a long line
of people who will never understand us.

38:05.118 --> 38:06.203
Did you tell her?

38:08.413 --> 38:10.290
- Happy Christmas?
- No. No.

38:12.167 --> 38:14.837
About me. About my mother.

38:15.337 --> 38:17.214
Nan, of course not. I told you I wouldn't.

38:17.214 --> 38:19.508
But you're the only other person that...

38:20.092 --> 38:23.428
I may have wondered about telling once,
but when I said I wouldn't, I meant it.

38:24.555 --> 38:27.182
And after everything--
All this being pulled into rooms and...

38:38.318 --> 38:41.071
So, if the duchess knows, does that mean...

38:41.738 --> 38:44.616
I'm not getting married.
You can be quite certain of that.

38:52.624 --> 38:53.625
And how do you feel?

38:57.796 --> 38:59.173
How do you feel about not getting married?

39:02.426 --> 39:03.427
Relieved.

39:06.597 --> 39:08.015
I didn't expect to say that.

39:25.157 --> 39:28.160
I have to go and tell him.

39:29.620 --> 39:31.580
Nan.

39:53.936 --> 39:54.937
Jinny.

40:02.402 --> 40:04.613
Jinny did what she thought was best, Annabel.

40:05.989 --> 40:06.990
As she always does.

40:15.332 --> 40:17.251
I will never forgive you.

40:19.044 --> 40:20.045
Not ever.

40:22.714 --> 40:24.800
I will lose everything
just because you are--

40:24.800 --> 40:27.886
What Jinny wants most of all, Nan,
is to avoid embarrassment.

40:29.346 --> 40:33.433
- So if you'd leave quietly--
- Is that what you want? Honestly?

40:36.270 --> 40:40.023
I'm sorry. Truly, I am. I--

40:41.567 --> 40:45.070
But your shame is not my fault.

40:51.535 --> 40:54.538
A marriage shouldn't be based
off of lies. You're right.

40:55.038 --> 40:56.498
And nor should a life.

41:08.010 --> 41:09.052
Who did you tell?

41:09.970 --> 41:14.474
The duchess has been good enough
to welcome us for Christmas, my love.

41:14.474 --> 41:17.269
It's absurd to think
this would've remained secret.

41:17.269 --> 41:19.897
Better to play it out quickly,
without fuss.

41:19.897 --> 41:22.441
If your sister doesn't trust you
to do what's best,

41:22.441 --> 41:25.027
I'm afraid it's only further proof
that you've grown apart.

41:34.828 --> 41:39.833
Annabel, as discussed, you won't
be joining us. Sit down, Theodore.

41:40.542 --> 41:44.046
- Everybody, shall we?
- Please. Your Grace, I have wanted--

41:50.427 --> 41:51.929
I have had enough of being frightened,

41:51.929 --> 41:53.639
and I have something
that I wanna say out loud.

42:00.020 --> 42:01.021
I'm illegitimate.

42:03.065 --> 42:04.191
My father was unfaithful

42:04.191 --> 42:06.693
and Patricia St. George
is not my natural mother.

42:07.486 --> 42:10.614
Although, I've come to believe
that motherhood is much more than blood.

42:11.323 --> 42:13.867
And in these last few months,
I have felt a million things,

42:13.867 --> 42:16.328
but what I refuse to feel any longer...

42:17.996 --> 42:19.039
is shame.

42:22.334 --> 42:24.837
And that might be American,
and that might be brash.

42:24.837 --> 42:26.713
And maybe I should've signaled it
with a glove

42:26.713 --> 42:28.757
and hoped that no one would see.

42:28.757 --> 42:33.178
But I am proud
to have survived the revelation.

42:35.848 --> 42:37.599
I am proud of my mother.

42:39.434 --> 42:41.019
And I am proud to be...

42:43.897 --> 42:44.898
I'm proud to be.

42:47.276 --> 42:49.278
I'm really sorry for having lied to you.

42:50.904 --> 42:51.905
I was afraid.

42:52.739 --> 42:55.534
Sometimes the more desperate you are
to tell somebody something,

42:55.534 --> 42:58.620
the harder it is to say.

42:58.620 --> 43:00.539
But I'm really sorry
for having embarrassed you,

43:00.539 --> 43:03.083
and I'm really sorry
for having ruined Christmas.

43:04.209 --> 43:06.003
It looks like a lovely lunch.

43:17.014 --> 43:18.682
You're quite right, of course.

43:18.682 --> 43:21.018
This entire display
has been incredibly American.

43:21.852 --> 43:24.771
But I happen to be very much in love
with an American.

43:26.064 --> 43:28.775
I know more than most
that we can't choose how we're born.

43:30.652 --> 43:34.072
But we can choose who we are
and who we love.

43:35.991 --> 43:38.702
I choose being a person who loves you.

43:38.702 --> 43:42.956
I loved you the moment I saw you,
and I will never stop choosing you.

43:44.249 --> 43:47.711
Annabel St. George,
you are the woman I want to marry.

43:49.379 --> 43:50.672
That'll never change.

43:52.758 --> 43:56.386
And if necessary, though I know it can
be crowded up there on Christmas Day,

43:56.386 --> 43:58.430
I will shout it from the rooftop.

44:00.307 --> 44:03.185
I love you, Nan.

44:21.662 --> 44:23.622
I was worried you'd changed your mind.

44:23.622 --> 44:25.791
I haven't. Not a bit.

44:28.460 --> 44:30.379
Let's make Christmas less complicated.

44:39.930 --> 44:42.432
Theodore,
we need to talk about this in private.
