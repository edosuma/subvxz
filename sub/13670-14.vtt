WEBVTT

00:01.440 --> 00:04.760
 Previously on St Elsewhere.  Jack
 wants us to deposit some sperm.

00:04.760 --> 00:07.920
I don't want my flesh and blood
 wandering around without me.

00:07.920 --> 00:08.920
     It means you're pregnant.

00:08.920 --> 00:10.600
     It means you're pregnant.
All right!

00:10.600 --> 00:13.520
The news isn't good. Mrs Valere did
have a miscarriage.

00:13.520 --> 00:15.440
Zoos have had better luck
breeding pandas!

00:15.440 --> 00:17.040
Zoos have had better luck
breeding pandas!
Don't give up hope.

00:17.040 --> 00:20.320
     Dr and Mrs Wayne Fiscus.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.240
Dr and Mrs Wayne Fiscus.

00:22.240 --> 00:25.280
If I make this, the wedding's off.

00:25.280 --> 00:26.560
OK, two out of three.

00:26.560 --> 00:30.560
Fiscus?
You're gonna marry that bubblehead?

02:03.280 --> 02:06.640
 I haven't been here in 15 years.

02:06.640 --> 02:10.440
The neighbourhood's
a bit worse for wear,

02:10.440 --> 02:13.040
and the hospital could use
a facelift.

02:13.040 --> 02:14.920
When are they gonna
repaint your office?

02:14.920 --> 02:15.360
When are they gonna
repaint your office?
They just did.

02:15.360 --> 02:17.120
When are they gonna
repaint your office?
They just did.
                Oh.

02:17.120 --> 02:19.160
Sorry to keep you waiting, Donald,

02:19.160 --> 02:23.160
had to make sure everything was in
order for Mrs Endicott's arrival.

02:24.920 --> 02:28.240
Well, hello, Josiah.

02:28.240 --> 02:29.760
         Been a long time.

02:29.760 --> 02:32.080
Not long enough.

02:32.080 --> 02:36.080
Imagine, the big Boston General
hotshot. What are you, slumming?

02:36.200 --> 02:40.040
Augusta Endicott is not only my
patient, she is also a personal
friend.

02:40.040 --> 02:43.240
So close she won't let
you operate on her again,

02:43.240 --> 02:45.120
after you botched her bypass.

02:45.120 --> 02:47.080
Mark, why don't you take Josiah
down

02:47.080 --> 02:50.120
and show him that suite you've
  prepared for Mrs Endicott?

02:50.120 --> 02:51.640
Sure. This way.

02:51.640 --> 02:52.680
         Goodbye, doctor.

02:52.680 --> 02:56.680
See you later.

03:00.920 --> 03:04.920
For a woman of 74, she's
unremarkable for significant disease.

03:05.440 --> 03:09.440
Well, at that age, another heart
operation presents obvious risk.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.680
Dr Craig, your patient
    Mr Porter managed to score

03:12.680 --> 03:15.760
a grease-burger backed up
with fries and a coffee shake.

03:15.760 --> 03:18.880
He nearly exploded
when it all hit his large intestine.

03:18.880 --> 03:20.360
Get away from me, Ehrlich.

03:20.360 --> 03:24.360
Where are these nurses when the
patients commit dietary suicide?

03:24.400 --> 03:28.400
This place runs like
a Rube Goldberg contraption.

03:30.160 --> 03:34.160
Does Mrs Endicott understand that
if we operate she may not survive?

03:34.680 --> 03:36.560
After all they've endured in life,

03:36.560 --> 03:40.160
the Endicotts believe that their
destiny is firmly in God's hands.

03:40.160 --> 03:42.440
Thanks for suggesting me
     to the family.

03:42.440 --> 03:44.280
To be perfectly honest,

03:44.280 --> 03:48.280
I encourage Mrs Endicott to come
to St Eligius because when she dies,

03:48.280 --> 03:52.280
it'll be national news and I don't
want Boston General to take the heat.

03:58.400 --> 04:02.400
How quaint. I'll go to
the lobby and wait for a limo.

04:07.800 --> 04:11.360
The boys tell me this is all your
idea, Mark. What the hell's going on?

04:11.360 --> 04:14.560
Mrs Endicott is used to the best.
I want her to feel at home.

04:14.560 --> 04:18.560
You might at least have had the
decency to clear expenditures
with me, first.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.120
What's with you, Daniel?

04:20.120 --> 04:21.800
Skip your prunes this morning?

04:21.800 --> 04:25.760
For 50 years, the Endicotts have
ignored the financial needs of
St Eligius.

04:25.760 --> 04:29.760
Now that they deign to
come here, we're become
part of a dog and pony show?

04:29.760 --> 04:31.840
    Well, I refuse to bootlick.

04:31.840 --> 04:34.720
Oh, for crying out loud!

04:34.720 --> 04:36.720
She'll be wearing slippers.

04:36.720 --> 04:40.720
No, sir, I'm not saying that no-one
will notice, but it will grow back.

04:42.080 --> 04:44.240
I just don't understand.

04:44.240 --> 04:47.360
How can a person go into
a hospital for wrist surgery

04:47.360 --> 04:49.920
and end up with a shaved head?

04:49.920 --> 04:52.880
Look, you're Mr S Adams in Room 5790.

04:52.880 --> 04:56.880
Now, the man in 5711, also Mr
S Adams, he's in for a brain biopsy.

04:58.400 --> 05:02.400
You incompetent tub o' lard!

05:02.680 --> 05:04.440
    You don't understand, look.

05:04.440 --> 05:06.440
S Adams, S Adams. Adjacent rooms.

05:06.440 --> 05:09.440
I got the charts mixed up.

05:09.440 --> 05:13.440
Look, it could be worse - I mean,
you could have had the brain biopsy
but, of course, you didn't.

05:14.320 --> 05:16.440
This is a real joke
to you, isn't it?

05:16.440 --> 05:17.920
No, sir. It really isn't.

05:17.920 --> 05:21.920
What are you trying to do -
get into some asinine medical
       fraternity or something?

05:22.200 --> 05:23.920
No. Do they have those?

05:23.920 --> 05:27.640
How the hell am I supposed to go
back to work looking like this?

05:27.640 --> 05:31.640
I'm an investment banker, and I look
like I just had shock therapy.

05:31.640 --> 05:35.360
No, sir. Actually, we don't do
surgical prep for shock therapy.

05:35.360 --> 05:37.800
We don't even do shock
therapy here, so...

05:37.800 --> 05:40.760
I don't even wanna look at
your face.

05:40.760 --> 05:41.640
I don't even wanna look at
your face.
                OK.

05:41.640 --> 05:45.640
I'd like to take your
big, jumbo-sized shorts
and stuff them down your throat.

05:45.960 --> 05:49.960
Well, maybe later
we can talk about it.

05:50.640 --> 05:52.320
      Well, what about June?

05:52.320 --> 05:54.560
Oh, everybody gets married in June.

05:54.560 --> 05:56.880
My parents wouldn't be able to
reserve a place for the reception.

05:56.880 --> 05:58.160
My parents wouldn't be able to
reserve a place for the reception.
             December?

05:58.160 --> 06:00.320
Never thought of myself
as a December bride.

06:00.320 --> 06:03.960
You're right, you don't look
anything like Spring Byington.

06:03.960 --> 06:06.240
Let's split the difference,
September.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.280
Does that gives my mom enough
  notice?

06:08.280 --> 06:11.240
Ike needed less time to
prepare for the invasion of Normandy.

06:11.240 --> 06:14.600
Ike needed less time to
prepare for the invasion of Normandy.
To Mom,
a wedding is a military action.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.360
A strategic placement of men

06:16.360 --> 06:20.360
and material at a particular time
and place for desired objectives.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.120
Wayne, excuse me, would you...

06:22.120 --> 06:24.320
Can you take the patient
in cubicle two, I'm late.

06:24.320 --> 06:25.080
Can you take the patient
in cubicle two, I'm late.
             For what?

06:25.080 --> 06:28.680
Dr Westphall's on my case
and I'm running behind.

06:28.680 --> 06:32.680
There are a million pre-nuptial
decisions to make.
 Mom agonises over them.

06:32.800 --> 06:35.800
Roast beef or capons,
      mums or gardenias,

06:35.800 --> 06:37.160
the seating arrangement,
who's gonna drive the priest...

06:37.160 --> 06:38.480
the seating arrangement,
who's gonna drive the priest...
              Rabbi.

06:38.480 --> 06:39.480
Judge.

06:39.480 --> 06:41.600
Judge.
              ..Deal.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.400
I gotta get back to surgery.

06:43.400 --> 06:47.400
Well, honey, I'm sure
whatever we decide, we'll be OK.

06:47.920 --> 06:49.080
                Cos you're the, er...

06:49.080 --> 06:53.080
                gorilla of my dreams.

07:01.240 --> 07:03.480
 Mrs Valere, sorry. I got held up.

07:03.480 --> 07:05.280
That's OK, Ken's
not here yet, anyway.

07:05.280 --> 07:07.720
That's OK, Ken's
not here yet, anyway.
    No, I mean, I  got  held up.
My wallet's gone.

07:07.720 --> 07:08.680
Were you hurt?

07:08.680 --> 07:11.560
Only to the tune of Â¤7 and
the last picture of my family.

07:11.560 --> 07:13.520
This has never happened
before, what do I do?

07:13.520 --> 07:15.400
This has never happened
before, what do I do?
First thing, you call the police,

07:15.400 --> 07:18.640
then insurance, vehicle registry
 and your credit cards.

07:18.640 --> 07:20.320
                       Credit cards?

07:20.320 --> 07:23.040
I'm the guy whose only
plastic is his demeanour.

07:23.040 --> 07:26.520
As the man said, "When you got
nothing, you got nothing to lose."

07:26.520 --> 07:28.200
Bob Dylan.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.920
        No, Floyd Shapiro, my barber.

07:29.920 --> 07:32.520
Hello, police?
Yes. Yes, I'll hold.

07:32.520 --> 07:36.520
When you said you'd do the surrogate
motherhood, it warmed my cockles.

07:36.560 --> 07:38.040
Yeah, well...

07:38.040 --> 07:42.040
Ken and I really hit rock bottom
 after this last miscarriage.

07:42.280 --> 07:44.240
The old marriage train pulling into
divorce station, I've been there.

07:44.240 --> 07:47.440
The old marriage train pulling into
divorce station, I've been there.
Well, the arguing's all but stopped.

07:47.440 --> 07:49.920
Only I'm not so sure that's good.

07:49.920 --> 07:53.920
At least when we had the pressure
of my trying to get pregnant we were
fighting, we had some passion.

07:55.200 --> 07:59.200
Now there's just resignation and
plenty of space between us in bed.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.680
Hello, yes, I'd like to
report a stolen wallet.

08:02.680 --> 08:06.680
Of course this is my real voice,
what are you...? Yes. Yes, I'll hold.

08:07.360 --> 08:11.360
I can't wait to meet this woman.

08:13.200 --> 08:16.400
I wonder what's keeping her.

08:16.400 --> 08:20.120
I bet she's decided to forget
  about this whole thing.

08:20.120 --> 08:22.400
Dr Ehrlich,
what if I don't like her?

08:22.400 --> 08:25.840
You're not signing any contracts
today, this is a how-do-you-do?

08:25.840 --> 08:29.840
If you go through with the procedure,
you never have to see her again.

08:30.920 --> 08:33.000
I wish I could carry this child.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.400
     You will, in nine months.

08:35.400 --> 08:39.400
Yes, yes. The perpetration took place
in the men's room at St Eligius.

08:41.039 --> 08:44.000
Of course I had them on at the time.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.080
What do you mean, I have to
come down there and file a report?

08:47.080 --> 08:51.080
No, I'm a doctor, I have people's
lives hanging in the balance.

08:51.640 --> 08:55.640
          Yes, I'll hold.

08:55.880 --> 08:59.320
Hello.

08:59.320 --> 09:03.320
Hi.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.040
           Dr Westphall,

09:09.040 --> 09:10.720
         please don't make me resign.

09:10.720 --> 09:14.680
It was a minor error, in my opinion,
one with a very logical explanation.

09:14.680 --> 09:17.400
          Mr S Adams, Mr S Adams, OK?

09:17.400 --> 09:19.360
Fine.

09:19.360 --> 09:23.360
It was just a bad hairdo.
I mean, I can't believe somebody
would win a malpractice suit

09:23.880 --> 09:26.560
because he looks a little
like Cyndi Lauper.

09:26.560 --> 09:30.000
Doctor, excuse me - I don't know
 what you're talking about.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.960
     You called to see me right away.

09:31.960 --> 09:35.560
Dr Valerie Harding. She does animal
research over at North-Eastern.

09:35.560 --> 09:39.520
She brought a baby gorilla down to
the ER and your father's
a veterinarian.

09:39.520 --> 09:42.360
I thought you might be able to
expedite the whole thing.

09:42.360 --> 09:43.800
                Oh.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.760
                Oh.
Dr Harding's pretty
vocal about demanding an assist,

09:46.760 --> 09:48.600
so let's get her in and out as
quick as we can, all right?

09:48.600 --> 09:51.440
so let's get her in and out as
quick as we can, all right?
That's it? That's what
you wanted to see me about?

09:51.440 --> 09:52.360
Yeah. Can you handle it?

09:52.360 --> 09:53.640
Yeah. Can you handle it?
          Of course, yes.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.400
Right. I'm doing rounds.

09:55.400 --> 09:58.920
Dr Westphall, would this count
as part of my community service?

09:58.920 --> 10:00.240
Get down to ER, will you?

10:00.240 --> 10:04.240
             I'm on my way. Yes, sir.

10:08.120 --> 10:10.880
Roland, why don't you stand there?

10:10.880 --> 10:13.480
And Walter, here.
That's a nice tie. Is that silk?

10:13.480 --> 10:16.400
Yes, and Josiah,
you're all right like that.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.240
Good, I was worried(!)

10:18.240 --> 10:20.520
Don't rain on my parade.
            It's not every day

10:20.520 --> 10:24.080
the matriarch of such a celebrated
  family comes to St Eligius.

10:24.080 --> 10:28.080
SIREN BLARES

10:33.280 --> 10:34.720
APPLAUSE

10:34.720 --> 10:35.440
        Morning, everybody.

10:35.440 --> 10:36.640
        Morning, everybody.
Senator.

10:36.640 --> 10:39.760
  Hello, Josiah. Good to see you.

10:39.760 --> 10:41.440
What are you doing out here?

10:41.440 --> 10:43.080
I like the smell of power.

10:43.080 --> 10:45.680
The senator's a good-looking man,
don't you think?

10:45.680 --> 10:48.000
The senator's a good-looking man,
don't you think?
I heard he's gay.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.200
Are you serious?

10:49.200 --> 10:53.200
Are you serious?
No.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.000
APPLAUSE

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
Mrs Endicott, on behalf of the
doctors, staff and personnel,
let me welcome you to St Eligius.

11:01.280 --> 11:05.120
And although America hasn't
yet had the chance to vote, &gt;

11:05.120 --> 11:09.120
we unanimously elect you Endicotts
our hospital's first family.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.440
Mrs Endicott...

11:12.440 --> 11:16.440
Dr Craig, I'm going into this
hospital the same way I intend
 to come out, under my own sail.

11:18.200 --> 11:21.360
Good.

11:21.360 --> 11:23.720
Senator Endicott,
can we get a statement, please?

11:23.720 --> 11:27.720
Senator Endicott,
can we get a statement, please?
&lt; Mr Senator?

11:49.720 --> 11:50.960
                     What's the rush?

11:50.960 --> 11:54.960
Westphall's leading rounds. I
finally have a chance to be on time.

12:07.800 --> 12:11.800
             Look out!

12:14.160 --> 12:18.160
     Just lay back. Lay back.

12:21.400 --> 12:24.680
That's enough, dear. You can go now.

12:24.680 --> 12:28.120
Let me give you a tip. If my name's
to remain on that bill,

12:28.120 --> 12:32.120
your house's sub-committee
will have to put back
that handicap school appropriation.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.000
 Michael, leave that stuff alone.

12:35.000 --> 12:35.640
 Michael, leave that stuff alone.
Yes, Dad.

12:35.640 --> 12:38.280
 Michael, leave that stuff alone.
Yes, Dad.
He wasn't bothering me, Gordon.

12:38.280 --> 12:40.000
         OK, great. Yeah.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.680
          I'll tell her.

12:42.680 --> 12:46.400
Speaker sends his best.

12:46.400 --> 12:49.520
Did I mention that Patricia's
on her way from Washington?

12:49.520 --> 12:51.400
Yes, twice.

12:51.400 --> 12:55.400
Jay and Christine are cutting short
their vacation. They're due tomorrow.

12:55.440 --> 12:59.440
Gareth and Maggie are planning
to arrive as soon as the jet's
refuelled.

12:59.560 --> 13:02.960
OK, time for your physical.

13:02.960 --> 13:05.000
 Will my using the phone disturb you?

13:05.000 --> 13:07.280
Yes, a nurse will
direct you to my office.

13:07.280 --> 13:11.280
Gordon, you have a perfectly good
office of your own on Beacon Hill.
  Go use it.

13:11.920 --> 13:12.760
            All right.

13:12.760 --> 13:14.680
            All right.
And take Michael with you.

13:14.680 --> 13:18.440
I can't. Michael,
find your brother and your cousin.

13:18.440 --> 13:21.040
      They'll take you home.

13:21.040 --> 13:24.800
Dr Craig, do you think that
medicine victimises the masses?

13:24.800 --> 13:27.200
What?

13:27.200 --> 13:29.200
I thought so.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.880
See you later.

13:31.880 --> 13:33.520
Take care of my grammy.

13:33.520 --> 13:37.520
She's all I got.

13:39.040 --> 13:41.480
Pardon me for saying so,
but isn't he a bit...?

13:41.480 --> 13:44.360
Peculiar.
But sweet.

13:44.360 --> 13:48.360
The Endicott family is
like the Liberty Bell.
        Looks great in the distance.

13:48.360 --> 13:52.360
It's only when you come in
close that you see the cracks.

13:52.840 --> 13:53.520
How does it feel?

13:53.520 --> 13:54.920
How does it feel?
Hurts.

13:54.920 --> 13:58.400
Maybe I can get extra credit for
this in my paramedic training.

13:58.400 --> 14:01.520
Of course, a head injury
would have counted a lot more.

14:01.520 --> 14:05.520
ANNOUNCEMENTS OVER TANNOY

14:06.840 --> 14:09.080
Great, Dr Doolittle's here.
Cubicle two.

14:09.080 --> 14:09.800
            Very funny.

14:09.800 --> 14:12.080
            Very funny.
I have a sprained finger
in number three.

14:12.080 --> 14:14.200
You think I should shave his whole
head before putting a splint on?

14:14.200 --> 14:15.640
You think I should shave his whole
head before putting a splint on?
                 Ha, ha, yackety-yak.

14:15.640 --> 14:17.920
You look pretty when you're angry.

14:17.920 --> 14:21.160
Hi, you must be Dr Harding.
I'm Elliot Axelrod.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.280
I understand your
gorilla needs attention?

14:23.280 --> 14:25.280
I understand your
gorilla needs attention?
Yes. His name is Dick.

14:25.280 --> 14:29.280
He's five weeks old.
Isn't he the most adorable gorilla
you've ever seen?

14:30.120 --> 14:31.520
        What seems to be the problem?

14:31.520 --> 14:34.400
        What seems to be the problem?
His mother, Pat,
stopped feeding him three days ago.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.640
He's intolerant of formula
and he seems dehydrated.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.880
He's intolerant of formula
and he seems dehydrated.
      Will you hold him still for me?

14:38.880 --> 14:41.720
Sure. I'm doing a language
    research project,

14:41.720 --> 14:45.720
and I just don't have the proper
 set-up for illness.

14:45.800 --> 14:49.800
               Here, let me hold him.

14:49.920 --> 14:52.360
                Oh!

14:52.360 --> 14:55.360
It's been a long time
since I held a baby gorilla.

14:55.360 --> 14:56.640
Junior prom.

14:56.640 --> 14:58.680
              Please!

14:58.680 --> 15:01.560
It's amazing how working with
animals helps relax me.

15:01.560 --> 15:05.560
I know exactly what you mean.

15:06.600 --> 15:10.600
Well, there's no visible signs of
disease, but he's very dehydrated.

15:11.320 --> 15:14.160
After some nourishment,
I think he'll be fine.

15:14.160 --> 15:16.880
You know, I would
really like to examine the mother.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.040
You know, I would
really like to examine the mother.
Why?

15:18.040 --> 15:20.120
Mothers don't stop feeding
their babies for no reason.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.760
Mothers don't stop feeding
their babies for no reason.
You'd really come to
the lab to check her out?

15:22.760 --> 15:25.720
             Sure, soon as I get off.

15:25.720 --> 15:28.080
Shave and a haircut, two bits.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.640
              Please.

15:29.640 --> 15:33.640
Besides, I could use a break from
humans, if you know what I mean.

15:34.800 --> 15:37.640
This is Jason. He's nine.

15:37.640 --> 15:39.960
Julie is eight.

15:39.960 --> 15:42.200
And Matthew. Matthew tells everybody

15:42.200 --> 15:45.720
he's six-and-three-quarters,
but he's really six-and-a-half.

15:45.720 --> 15:46.760
Beautiful.

15:46.760 --> 15:47.960
Beautiful.
                     Guys, I'm sorry.

15:47.960 --> 15:50.680
It's OK, honey.
He was late to our wedding too.

15:50.680 --> 15:53.080
Hi. I'm Jennifer Sobinski.

15:53.080 --> 15:55.000
Pleasure to meet you.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.120
Anything you want to
ask the mother in waiting?

15:58.120 --> 16:02.120
               Er...

16:02.440 --> 16:05.800
..what would make a woman want
to be a surrogate mother?

16:05.800 --> 16:08.720
Having kids is one
thing I'm good at.

16:08.720 --> 16:11.120
So I thought, why not?

16:11.120 --> 16:14.400
Besides, I haven't seen a support
cheque in about three months,

16:14.400 --> 16:17.120
and my kids could use
the ten grand.

16:17.120 --> 16:18.480
&lt; What happens next?

16:18.480 --> 16:20.880
Well, if you all agree to the
procedure,

16:20.880 --> 16:23.880
we can control Jennifer's cycle
 with female hormones

16:23.880 --> 16:27.120
to create a proper environment in
her uterus to receive an embryo.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.160
to create a proper environment in
her uterus to receive an embryo.
So my body will think I'm pregnant?

16:29.160 --> 16:32.800
Exactly.
Then we take an egg from Terri,
 some semen from Ken,

16:32.800 --> 16:36.160
and we fertilise
the ovum in the laboratory.

16:36.160 --> 16:40.160
When enough cell division has taken
place, we can implant the embryo

16:40.360 --> 16:43.000
in Jennifer's uterus. A few days
in bed, and you're pregnant.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.680
in Jennifer's uterus. A few days
in bed, and you're pregnant.
And craving butterscotch ice-cream!

16:45.680 --> 16:49.680
Oh, don't worry. My doctor said I've
got to eat right and get plenty of
rest and stuff like that.

16:50.600 --> 16:54.320
And you've got to promise to
surrender the child right
   after birth.

16:54.320 --> 16:56.880
           Mrs Sobinski,

16:56.880 --> 17:00.480
Â¤10,000 sounds like
a lot of money right now,

17:00.480 --> 17:03.880
but when the baby's born, are you
sure you'll be able to give it up?

17:03.880 --> 17:07.880
Mr Valere, I adore my kids.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.400
They mean everything
       in the world to me.

17:10.400 --> 17:13.280
And to help somebody else
    have a family,

17:13.280 --> 17:16.319
that's something I can be proud of.

17:16.319 --> 17:20.319
Speaking of which, I've got
to get back to my own kids.

17:23.480 --> 17:27.200
Well, I'll be in touch right after
the Valeres make up their minds.

17:27.200 --> 17:31.200
We...we already have.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.880
Let's do it.

17:33.880 --> 17:36.840
Edie, if I'm asking
for too much, tell me.

17:36.840 --> 17:38.560
I voted for your family
             in every election.

17:38.560 --> 17:39.800
I voted for your family
             in every election.
So you'll do it?

17:39.800 --> 17:40.600
No.

17:40.600 --> 17:44.160
No.
This is my grandmother's recipe  for
flan. It would make her stay...

17:44.160 --> 17:46.160
No can do.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.000
Do you enjoy the Cape?

17:47.000 --> 17:48.920
Do you enjoy the Cape?
Who doesn't?

17:48.920 --> 17:50.120
Would you like to see the compound?

17:50.120 --> 17:54.120
We've got a kitchen
you wouldn't believe.

17:54.680 --> 17:56.320
We've got a kitchen
you wouldn't believe.
How often does she eat flan?

17:56.320 --> 17:58.160
 Edie, where's the complaint box?

17:58.160 --> 18:00.040
 There's no apple in my dumpling.

18:00.040 --> 18:04.040
So this is where you hang
out between marathons.

18:04.600 --> 18:07.160
Dougie, how you doing?
I didn't recognise you

18:07.160 --> 18:09.400
without your running shorts.
Do you work in food service now?

18:09.400 --> 18:10.880
without your running shorts.
Do you work in food service now?
No, my grandmother just checked in.

18:10.880 --> 18:12.640
without your running shorts.
Do you work in food service now?
No, my grandmother just checked in.
      Oh, sorry to hear that.

18:12.640 --> 18:14.760
     Nothing serious, I hope.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.120
We don't know yet. We're waiting
for Dr Craig to finish some tests.

18:17.120 --> 18:18.640
We don't know yet. We're waiting
for Dr Craig to finish some tests.
    That may be quite a stall.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.360
Dr Craig's focused
full-time on Augusta Endicott.

18:21.360 --> 18:22.920
   She's in for a heart rehaul.

18:22.920 --> 18:25.520
I know, that's my grandmother.

18:25.520 --> 18:29.520
No kidding! You're an Endicott, as in
power, charisma and major trust fund?

18:29.600 --> 18:30.600
Guilty.

18:30.600 --> 18:33.280
Guilty.
God, I like you!

18:33.280 --> 18:37.280
I wish I could have lunch,
but I got to perform an in vitro.
Good seeing you.

18:38.520 --> 18:42.520
It's on him.

18:45.640 --> 18:47.800
Victor, look what I found.

18:47.800 --> 18:48.840
Oh, Wayne!

18:48.840 --> 18:52.840
Um...where's my seven bucks?

18:53.520 --> 18:55.160
How am I supposed to know?

18:55.160 --> 18:58.240
You want to frisk me?
     While I'm here, do me a favour.

18:58.240 --> 19:01.680
Will you check the sperm
        freezer's temperature chart?

19:01.680 --> 19:04.800
Worried Juanita defrosted
the fridge by mistake, huh?

19:04.800 --> 19:07.080
In case something
happens to me down under.

19:07.080 --> 19:10.440
Lorna and I will still be able to
have little Fiscus or Fiscarina.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.480
This sperm is
my genetic safety valve.

19:12.480 --> 19:16.040
 Fiscus, Wayne. Tray 12, vial 307.

19:16.040 --> 19:17.640
Went down to the lab this morning.

19:17.640 --> 19:18.520
Went down to the lab this morning.
What for?

19:18.520 --> 19:21.720
In-vitro fertilisation, Mrs Tillman.

19:21.720 --> 19:24.280
Some couple's gonna
use my sperm to have a child?

19:24.280 --> 19:27.560
Lighten up. Not like somebody gave
away your Lovin' Spoonful collection.

19:27.560 --> 19:28.760
Lighten up. Not like somebody gave
away your Lovin' Spoonful collection.
How can you be so glib?

19:28.760 --> 19:30.880
I'm gonna wind up with some
offspring out there somewhere.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.360
I'm gonna wind up with some
offspring out there somewhere.
       Go back to the well.

19:32.360 --> 19:36.360
A son, a daughter, with my genes,
with my intelligence, with part of
  my soul. What was the name?

19:37.920 --> 19:39.040
Tillman.

19:39.040 --> 19:41.880
I'm gonna put a stop to this.

19:41.880 --> 19:44.200
        Nice work, Boomer.

19:44.200 --> 19:47.040
    Clean tear of the meniscus.

19:47.040 --> 19:48.240
Are you sure?

19:48.240 --> 19:49.960
       Right here in black and white.

19:49.960 --> 19:53.960
Might as well get you on the OR
docket and have your knees scoped.

19:59.680 --> 20:01.240
I'd like a second opinion.

20:01.240 --> 20:02.520
             What for?

20:02.520 --> 20:04.720
I don't wish to go
through unnecessary surgery.

20:04.720 --> 20:07.720
I don't wish to go
through unnecessary surgery.
The radiologist
confirmed my diagnosis.

20:07.720 --> 20:09.600
Well, a third opinion.

20:09.600 --> 20:10.760
Well, a third opinion.
   You don't trust my judgment.

20:10.760 --> 20:11.480
Well, a third opinion.
   You don't trust my judgment.
No, I just...

20:11.480 --> 20:14.760
        No! Wait a second.

20:14.760 --> 20:18.360
     Do you trust my judgment or not?

20:18.360 --> 20:19.360
Yeah.

20:19.360 --> 20:22.360
Yeah.
Good. Then I say you
should have the surgery.

20:22.360 --> 20:24.440
I'd still like to
talk to someone else.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.080
               Why?

20:26.080 --> 20:29.840
A patient has the right
to be 100 per cent sure.

20:29.840 --> 20:31.400
                       A patient? OK.

20:31.400 --> 20:34.640
To a patient I'm a stranger.
But to you I'm a colleague.

20:34.640 --> 20:36.400
You either respect me or you don't.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.360
You either respect me or you don't.
I just want another opinion.

20:38.360 --> 20:42.360
         Fine. Start looking for one.

20:49.960 --> 20:51.240
Excuse me.

20:51.240 --> 20:51.920
                                Yeah?

20:51.920 --> 20:55.040
                                Yeah?
Hi, I'm Sarah Preston,
  Mrs Endicott's granddaughter.

20:55.040 --> 20:56.920
You're not going to
have that here, are you?

20:56.920 --> 20:59.520
You're not going to
have that here, are you?
No, I'm months away
from the big drop.

20:59.520 --> 21:03.480
We'd appreciate it if you'd use
these sheets instead of the
 hospital linen.

21:03.480 --> 21:05.920
Gran would feel more
comfortable with...

21:05.920 --> 21:07.320
                               Sorry?

21:07.320 --> 21:09.440
It's the name of Gran's sheets.

21:09.440 --> 21:13.000
I guess that must seem sort of odd.
It's like The Princess And The Pea.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.120
my grandmother would feel
the difference.

21:16.120 --> 21:17.840
       I guess we wouldn't want that.

21:17.840 --> 21:21.480
All right, I'll change the sheets
after the doctor examines her.

21:21.480 --> 21:24.280
That'd be terrific, thank you.

21:24.280 --> 21:28.280
&lt; Bobby!

21:32.240 --> 21:33.400
Where's my semen?

21:33.400 --> 21:34.720
Where'd you leave it?

21:34.720 --> 21:36.920
The bank sent the
vial here by mistake.

21:36.920 --> 21:37.440
                         Case number?

21:37.440 --> 21:38.840
                         Case number?
I don't know it.

21:38.840 --> 21:39.680
                    Who's the doctor?

21:39.680 --> 21:41.160
                    Who's the doctor?
I don't know the doctor.

21:41.160 --> 21:45.160
If somebody's
using your genes, they're not
interested in having bright kids.

21:45.600 --> 21:47.960
The patient's name is Tillman.

21:47.960 --> 21:49.600
             Oh, yeah.

21:49.600 --> 21:53.600
I just sent some solution
up to Dr Chandler...

21:54.440 --> 21:56.840
for an in vitro.

21:56.840 --> 21:58.360
My ship sailed without me.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.040
Maybe he hasn't started yet.

22:00.040 --> 22:04.040
Still time to cut him off.

22:13.520 --> 22:15.000
Chandler, where is he?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.440
Exam Room 3, doing an in vitro.

22:16.440 --> 22:17.840
Exam Room 3, doing an in vitro.
Why didn't you tell me?

22:17.840 --> 22:19.440
Whoa! He's with a patient.

22:19.440 --> 22:20.320
I know, Mrs Tillman.

22:20.320 --> 22:21.400
I know, Mrs Tillman.
Why don't you try knocking?

22:21.400 --> 22:23.000
I know, Mrs Tillman.
Why don't you try knocking?
I have to speak to Phil.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.920
Well, in two weeks we'll know whether
Mrs Tillman is pregnant or not.

22:25.920 --> 22:26.680
Well, in two weeks we'll know whether
Mrs Tillman is pregnant or not.
Oh, good!

22:26.680 --> 22:27.480
                     What's going on?

22:27.480 --> 22:31.480
                     What's going on?
Never mind.

22:33.160 --> 22:37.160
You did the right thing.
A lot of people think
surrogate mothering is immoral.

22:37.680 --> 22:41.680
Heck, 300 years ago, it was a crime
for a doctor to cut open a human
body and remove diseased tissue.

22:44.080 --> 22:48.080
A heart beating in another's body
would have been considered depraved
and ghoulish just a generation ago.

22:49.560 --> 22:53.560
But if we can use technology
   to improve and sustain life,

22:53.960 --> 22:57.960
why can't we use it to create life
where it wouldn't otherwise exist?
Here you go.

23:01.400 --> 23:05.400
         I can't do this.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.160
Torn meniscus.

23:10.160 --> 23:14.160
And a beaut.

23:15.200 --> 23:19.200
Let's have a look.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
Oh, yeah.

23:31.400 --> 23:35.400
You got that baby good.

23:36.240 --> 23:40.240
Man, I am hungry.

23:41.800 --> 23:42.240
Chocolate bar?

23:42.240 --> 23:44.320
Chocolate bar?
            No thanks.

23:44.320 --> 23:46.080
OK.

23:46.080 --> 23:49.320
Any rookie could've
diagnosed that knee.

23:49.320 --> 23:53.320
Short of chopping it off, and
going with one of these models,

23:54.840 --> 23:58.080
arthroscopic surgery is your best
bet. Someone tell you different?

23:58.080 --> 24:00.560
                No.

24:00.560 --> 24:01.840
Then what's the problem?

24:01.840 --> 24:05.200
  I've never had surgery before.

24:05.200 --> 24:08.240
No tonsillectomy, no appendectomy.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.320
No stitches?

24:09.320 --> 24:11.400
      Not even a bloody nose.

24:11.400 --> 24:14.920
Sounds like you've led
a pretty boring life.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.120
What are you afraid of?

24:16.120 --> 24:18.400
              Dying.

24:18.400 --> 24:21.960
I know all the things that can
go wrong, I've seen what happens.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.840
    Mistakes in anaesthesia...

24:24.840 --> 24:28.840
foul-ups in surgery, post-op
complications, infection...

24:29.720 --> 24:33.080
Invasion from Mars?

24:33.080 --> 24:36.040
It's why
God invented health insurance.

24:36.040 --> 24:39.120
Right after he created
fear of the ridiculous.

24:39.120 --> 24:43.120
I've got a small son. I'm worried
something will happen to me.

24:44.600 --> 24:48.440
Morrison, I'm head of
orthopaedics - the buck stops here.

24:48.440 --> 24:52.440
If you die,
  I'll probably lose my job. OK?

24:56.600 --> 24:58.880
Awful good.

24:58.880 --> 25:02.880
You feel better now
you've aired your fears?

25:05.560 --> 25:08.400
Then let's cut this crap, OK?

25:08.400 --> 25:10.160
Get yourself admitted,

25:10.160 --> 25:14.160
and I'll schedule you for
scope time right away. OK?

25:18.920 --> 25:22.920
Somebody's having a baby that is
half mine and I'm not involved.
It's weird.

25:23.520 --> 25:25.160
               Yeah.

25:25.160 --> 25:26.800
Maybe we ought to elope.

25:26.800 --> 25:29.120
We could blow out of
here Friday after work.

25:29.120 --> 25:31.000
I thought we were gonna
get married in September!

25:31.000 --> 25:32.600
I thought we were gonna
get married in September!
If we take the plunge
now, we'd be welcoming

25:32.600 --> 25:34.280
our first child by Columbus Day.

25:34.280 --> 25:36.000
In three years we'd be able to fill

25:36.000 --> 25:39.480
the back seat of the station wagon
with tots and golden retrievers...

25:39.480 --> 25:41.320
Slow down,
I don't know if I want dogs,

25:41.320 --> 25:43.240
and I certainly don't want children.

25:43.240 --> 25:44.360
'Course you do!

25:44.360 --> 25:45.640
           No, I don't!

25:45.640 --> 25:48.080
That's insane,
everybody wants children.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.240
              Not me.

25:49.240 --> 25:53.240
Then why are we getting married?

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
   Wayne, we'll talk later, OK?

25:59.600 --> 26:00.920
You're not sterile, Fiscus.

26:00.920 --> 26:02.480
That's the point!

26:02.480 --> 26:04.920
You tie the knot,
you have babies, the divine plan.

26:04.920 --> 26:07.800
Who says?
Children aren't a priority for me.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.880
Well, before I die, I want to pass
the baton on to a new generation.

26:10.880 --> 26:13.360
And I want to have a
career, a life of my own.

26:13.360 --> 26:16.000
You call what you do a career?

26:16.000 --> 26:18.920
For your information,
Mona Polito was one of the finest

26:18.920 --> 26:21.480
scrub nurses I ever had the
privilege of working with.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.920
Knows her tools, her
anatomy, her place.

26:23.920 --> 26:26.480
I said from beginning, marrying
this bubblehead is a mistake.

26:26.480 --> 26:28.520
If you don't mind, Dr Craig,
   keep out of this.

26:28.520 --> 26:31.120
Yes, and you stay out of my office.

26:31.120 --> 26:33.800
Scram.
..Mona. Let's get started.

26:33.800 --> 26:37.800
Well, I hope you two
are very happy together.

26:38.320 --> 26:42.320
Scalpel.

26:43.040 --> 26:45.960
    It's just right there.  OK.

26:45.960 --> 26:48.320
I appreciate you
taking Pete for the day.

26:48.320 --> 26:50.240
Just like old times.

26:50.240 --> 26:52.080
Just like old times.
I didn't have anybody
else I could call.

26:52.080 --> 26:56.080
Spare me, but when you said
you were having surgery, I was
  already halfway here.

26:56.360 --> 27:00.360
    Nobody seems to understand.

27:02.200 --> 27:05.960
If something happens,
Pete won't have me.

27:05.960 --> 27:08.920
            I'm scared.

27:08.920 --> 27:11.880
I understand.

27:11.880 --> 27:14.280
I think you bring
out the mother in me.

27:14.280 --> 27:17.320
How long are you
going to be laid up?

27:17.320 --> 27:21.320
  We won't know until we get in.

27:23.840 --> 27:27.840
Hi. Who do you belong to?

27:29.640 --> 27:32.760
The silent type, huh?

27:32.760 --> 27:34.200
Shake hands?

27:34.200 --> 27:38.200
How'd you like to give
your new friend a hug?

27:38.960 --> 27:42.960
I could sure use one.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.560
I'm sorry he bothered you.

27:54.560 --> 27:55.280
Are you his mom?

27:55.280 --> 27:57.480
Are you his mom?
No, he doesn't have one.
Come here.

27:57.480 --> 27:58.880
Shame.

27:58.880 --> 28:02.600
Yeah. Bye-bye.

28:02.600 --> 28:04.880
So long, shortstop.

28:04.880 --> 28:07.840
Here you go.

28:07.840 --> 28:11.840
 Where do you think you're going?

28:21.000 --> 28:24.880
And the stories that Mrs Endicott
tells me about what's really going on

28:24.880 --> 28:28.280
in Washington are flabbergasting.
The woman is fabulous.

28:28.280 --> 28:30.080
I'm glad you two are
getting on so well.

28:30.080 --> 28:32.280
And when you think of what
they've done for Boston...

28:32.280 --> 28:35.360
For all Henry Endicott's
     philanthropy,

28:35.360 --> 28:39.200
he was totally without ethics
in establishing that dynasty.

28:39.200 --> 28:43.200
There were misdeeds that would today
land him in prison,
minimum security, no doubt.

28:43.840 --> 28:46.680
Oh, Daniel, don't get preachy
with me.

28:46.680 --> 28:50.680
I watched that old man
operate in this town. He was the
 worst of all parasites.

28:50.880 --> 28:53.880
Daniel, as long as she's a patient
in this hospital, I don't think

28:53.880 --> 28:55.520
she should be victimised
by her husband's reputation.

28:55.520 --> 28:59.320
The family lives off
the empire he built.

28:59.320 --> 29:03.320
Augusta Endicott is no better than
any other patient in this hospital.

29:03.320 --> 29:06.040
She won't use her celebrity to get
preferential treatment from me.

29:06.040 --> 29:10.040
Well if you don't mind, I'm now going
to get her preliminary test results.
OK?

29:13.360 --> 29:14.640
I don't think I'm out of line.

29:14.640 --> 29:17.960
I don't think I'm out of line.
Well, my friend, I think if
you can't deal with the Endicott

29:17.960 --> 29:21.960
family, maybe you'd
better steer clear of them.

29:29.480 --> 29:32.560
I feel like I've just
won the Kentucky Derby!

29:32.560 --> 29:34.400
Next time I get sick I only hope

29:34.400 --> 29:37.040
my friends respond with
this much affection.

29:37.040 --> 29:40.320
It isn't out of affection
but political acumen.

29:40.320 --> 29:43.120
Most of these lobbyists couldn't
care less whether I live or die.

29:43.120 --> 29:45.600
Then why keep their gifts?

29:45.600 --> 29:49.440
Well,
flowers do brighten up the room.

29:49.440 --> 29:52.520
Helen. Would you excuse us, please?

29:52.520 --> 29:53.840
The verdict is in?

29:53.840 --> 29:57.120
Well, besides the original
    bypass graft not working,

29:57.120 --> 30:01.120
there are several blockages of
  the blood flow to your heart.

30:01.120 --> 30:04.600
We can manage the
    condition with medication

30:04.600 --> 30:06.880
or we can do a quadruple bypass.

30:06.880 --> 30:10.880
Are you telling me I should
have the surgery or not?

30:12.120 --> 30:16.120
At your age, each option entails
 different risks and gains.

30:17.760 --> 30:20.920
There's recent evidence that
  surgery may prolong your life.

30:20.920 --> 30:23.920
Since I married Henry,

30:23.920 --> 30:27.920
my life has flowed
on the Endicott current.

30:28.960 --> 30:32.960
Perhaps now it's time to run a
more natural course.

30:36.160 --> 30:40.160
No operation.

30:53.040 --> 30:56.440
We've been doing experiments in
audio-erotic stimulation.

30:56.440 --> 31:00.320
Julio Iglesias, Frank Sinatra,
that sort of thing.

31:00.320 --> 31:04.080
Poor pet. The male gorilla just cut
right through the courting process,

31:04.080 --> 31:07.440
proving that male gorillas
are not interested in science.

31:07.440 --> 31:11.440
There are people who
actually fund this kind of research?

31:11.480 --> 31:12.600
               Yeah.

31:12.600 --> 31:14.240
Amazing.

31:14.240 --> 31:18.240
Did you notice any unusual behaviour
changes once in childbirth.

31:19.320 --> 31:22.120
I just assumed that everything
going on was a function

31:22.120 --> 31:25.040
of the postpartum adjustment.
But what do I know?

31:25.040 --> 31:29.040
She's been alternating between a
sort of giddiness and dullness.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.040
GRUNTING

31:33.040 --> 31:35.360
    Sorry, Pat, but it's true.

31:35.360 --> 31:36.800
What else?

31:36.800 --> 31:40.520
In the last few weeks, she seems
reluctant to sign with her left arm.

31:40.520 --> 31:43.520
Actually, she's been
favouring her whole left side.

31:43.520 --> 31:44.520
Any vomiting?

31:44.520 --> 31:46.920
A couple of times.

31:46.920 --> 31:50.920
You know, I could be wrong, but I
think she may have a brain tumour.

31:51.960 --> 31:52.880
God!

31:52.880 --> 31:55.880
We can get an X-ray and if that
proves positive,

31:55.880 --> 31:59.000
we can go ahead with a CAT scan,
so we know for sure.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.480
Before we go through the
hassle of taking a 500-pound gorilla

32:02.480 --> 32:05.440
to the hospital,
shouldn't you examine her first?

32:05.440 --> 32:08.120
Erm...I don't know.
I didn't bring my rubber gloves.

32:08.120 --> 32:10.400
Erm...I don't know.
I didn't bring my rubber gloves.
        She won't hurt you.

32:10.400 --> 32:12.840
Especially if you sing
Strangers In The Night.

32:12.840 --> 32:13.400
You're kidding?

32:13.400 --> 32:16.360
You're kidding?
                No.

32:16.360 --> 32:19.760
# Strangers in the night

32:19.760 --> 32:22.800
# Exchanging glances

32:22.800 --> 32:26.360
# Wondering in the night

32:26.360 --> 32:28.360
# What were the chances... #

32:28.360 --> 32:31.160
We're in, Morrison.

32:31.160 --> 32:35.160
Dead yet?

32:35.440 --> 32:38.240
There's your meniscus.

32:38.240 --> 32:41.160
Textbook tear.

32:41.160 --> 32:45.160
I'm just going to poke around
a little though. You mind?  No.

32:45.760 --> 32:49.760
You can open your eyes.

32:51.280 --> 32:52.320
I hate this.

32:52.320 --> 32:55.640
Let's talk about something
else then. The Celtics?

32:55.640 --> 32:57.360
Don't follow sports.

32:57.360 --> 32:59.120
Hobbies?  I don't have any.

32:59.120 --> 33:03.120
Maybe we'll just let it rest.

33:04.160 --> 33:05.280
Whoops.

33:05.280 --> 33:06.480
What? What's wrong?

33:06.480 --> 33:10.400
Take it easy, take it easy.
X-ray has missed something.

33:10.400 --> 33:14.400
It looks like you went and tore
the anterior cruciate ligament too.

33:14.720 --> 33:17.360
Right there.

33:17.360 --> 33:19.320
Now what?

33:19.320 --> 33:23.280
I get home late
and you're in for a long nap.

33:23.280 --> 33:27.280
When you wake up, you'll be
wearing a nice white cast

33:27.400 --> 33:30.760
covering a dozen or so stitches.
I've got to open up the knee.

33:30.760 --> 33:33.440
I want a second opinion.

33:33.440 --> 33:37.440
OK. Here you go.

33:39.440 --> 33:43.040
You're going on rotation
in my department soon.

33:43.040 --> 33:46.360
If you don't shut up
you'll never make it through.

33:46.360 --> 33:50.360
There's your second opinion.
What do you say?

33:52.160 --> 33:56.160
I thought so.

33:57.200 --> 34:01.200
Sweet dreams.

34:08.120 --> 34:10.080
          Mrs Tillman...

34:10.080 --> 34:11.360
          I'm Dr Fiscus.

34:11.360 --> 34:15.280
Hi.

34:15.280 --> 34:16.400
Can I help you?

34:16.400 --> 34:20.400
Um... Dr Chandler told me
to look in on you.

34:20.760 --> 34:22.320
     How did the in vitro go?

34:22.320 --> 34:26.320
Oh, fine. It wasn't as
humiliating as I thought.

34:26.520 --> 34:29.360
         So, boy or girl?

34:29.360 --> 34:32.760
It doesn't matter.
As long as it's healthy.

34:32.760 --> 34:35.880
Even if it's not,
I could live with that.

34:35.880 --> 34:38.440
But I've been wondering about

34:38.440 --> 34:40.920
what it's going to be
like when it grows up.

34:40.920 --> 34:44.920
You know, if it'll be like
artistically inclined or musical...

34:47.199 --> 34:49.600
Oh, he'll be a hell of an athlete.

34:49.600 --> 34:51.639
              I bet.

34:51.639 --> 34:55.639
He'll have the looks of Magnum PI
and the mind of Albert Einstein.

34:57.680 --> 35:01.680
Well, would you settle
for the looks of Albert Einstein and
the mind of Magnum?

35:02.200 --> 35:05.560
I really don't have any
expectations any more.

35:05.560 --> 35:09.520
I mean, I thought my husband's
business was going to skyrocket.

35:09.520 --> 35:12.960
But it didn't. And I really
wanted to live in Newton.

35:12.960 --> 35:15.560
But the Charleston apartment's OK.

35:15.560 --> 35:19.560
And I thought I was going to have a
van full of kids. But he couldn't.

35:20.480 --> 35:24.480
That stinks. You've got nothing
you wanted out of marriage.

35:24.560 --> 35:27.840
Till now.

35:27.840 --> 35:31.840
My husband saved and
saved to give me this baby.

35:32.000 --> 35:36.000
Aren't you curious to know
who the natural father is?

35:36.360 --> 35:38.720
No. This is going to be our child.

35:38.720 --> 35:40.920
My husband's and mine.

35:40.920 --> 35:43.520
But what about you? Are you married?

35:43.520 --> 35:44.880
                No.

35:44.880 --> 35:48.520
  And I don't think I'll ever be.

35:48.520 --> 35:50.240
             So long.

35:50.240 --> 35:54.240
Bye.

35:57.880 --> 36:00.080
    Hey! How's the chimp, chum?

36:00.080 --> 36:02.600
On the road to recovery,
thank you very much.

36:02.600 --> 36:05.160
Of course, you and
Dick had a symbiotic relationship.

36:05.160 --> 36:08.760
Maybe you should hit on the lady vet,
she's interested in Cro-Magnons.

36:08.760 --> 36:11.640
We're going on a picnic
this very afternoon.

36:11.640 --> 36:13.040
    Who's bringing the bananas?

36:13.040 --> 36:15.960
Why are you so bent out of shape?

36:15.960 --> 36:19.960
OK, I'll tell you why. I'm losing
patience with a couple
of these patients, the Blairs.

36:20.520 --> 36:23.360
Talk about your wishy-washy,
no guts approach to life.

36:23.360 --> 36:27.360
I'm gonna go in there and
give them a piece of my mind.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.280
Mr and Mrs Blair,
I'd like to talk to the two of you.

36:31.280 --> 36:35.120
Before you say anything, Doctor,
we apologise.

36:35.120 --> 36:39.120
We...don't know how you people have
put up with us these past
five months.

36:39.480 --> 36:43.480
We've been self-centred
and totally unco-operative.

36:43.480 --> 36:44.600
           Yeah, but...

36:44.600 --> 36:46.720
           Yeah, but...
Sure, we pay our bills,
but that's not enough.

36:46.720 --> 36:49.840
Ken has decided to go
along with adopting a child.

36:49.840 --> 36:50.840
           I thought...

36:50.840 --> 36:54.120
Today, I held a child
who had no mother.

36:54.120 --> 36:57.360
He just walked right up to
me and stretched out his arms.

36:57.360 --> 37:00.840
And I realised,
Terry could be his mother.

37:00.840 --> 37:04.440
She could love him and give
him a home and a chance to grow.

37:04.440 --> 37:07.320
And so could I.

37:07.320 --> 37:10.640
I've been wanting a kid
for the wrong reason.

37:10.640 --> 37:13.680
Being a parent is about
giving, not having.

37:13.680 --> 37:17.400
We have all the advantages in life.
We should share them.

37:17.400 --> 37:20.200
 Sounds great, when do I move in?!

37:20.200 --> 37:22.320
We owe it all to you guys.

37:22.320 --> 37:23.320
                              Thanks.

37:23.320 --> 37:26.080
Yeah.

37:26.080 --> 37:27.800
      Goodbye. Stay in touch.

37:27.800 --> 37:29.320
We will.

37:29.320 --> 37:30.840
Thank you.

37:30.840 --> 37:34.840
             (LAUGHS)

37:37.040 --> 37:39.560
What are you so happy about?

37:39.560 --> 37:42.800
Something, something
wonderful just happened here.

37:42.800 --> 37:46.800
       I wonder what the hell it was?

37:50.800 --> 37:54.200
Luther,
where are you going with that?

37:54.200 --> 37:57.520
Either into storage or the
incinerator, whatever I find first.

37:57.520 --> 37:58.160
Why?

37:58.160 --> 37:59.880
Why?
It was hanging in
Mrs Endicott's room.

37:59.880 --> 38:02.400
She said it was ugly, and if
you ask me, I think she's right.

38:02.400 --> 38:04.560
Some man sneezes paint on a canvas,

38:04.560 --> 38:08.120
some bozo frames it
and you've got art at any price.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.320
I've had enough.

38:09.320 --> 38:11.040
I'm entitled to an opinion.

38:11.040 --> 38:12.520
Not from you, Mrs Endicott.

38:12.520 --> 38:16.080
See that that gets to storage.

38:16.080 --> 38:17.520
KNOCK AT DOOR

38:17.520 --> 38:18.560
             Come in.

38:18.560 --> 38:22.560
Mrs Endicott, I'm Daniel
Auschlander, chief of services.

38:22.680 --> 38:24.760
   Well, I'm happy to know you.

38:24.760 --> 38:28.760
This hospital serves
2,000 patients a day.

38:28.760 --> 38:32.680
We can't accommodate the special
needs of every single person.

38:32.680 --> 38:36.320
I've been a part of the
Endicott family for generations.

38:36.320 --> 38:40.120
You're not the first, although you
may be the last to sling mud at me.

38:40.120 --> 38:43.440
I must warn you, however, that I'm
quite adept at dishing it out myself.

38:43.440 --> 38:47.440
We can either yell
or talk, your choice.

38:47.720 --> 38:51.720
I apologise for being rude.

38:51.720 --> 38:54.960
  I'm not naive, Dr Auschlander.

38:54.960 --> 38:57.840
I know such behaviour
masks a much deeper wound.

38:57.840 --> 39:00.480
Who was it in my family
who compromised you?

39:00.480 --> 39:01.600
It's not the point.

39:01.600 --> 39:05.440
     Even so, please tell me.

39:05.440 --> 39:09.440
I was supposed to be appointed
to the Board of Medical Quality
Assurance by the Governor.

39:10.080 --> 39:12.400
I was young, it would
have been quite an honour.

39:12.400 --> 39:14.040
Apparently, however, your husband

39:14.040 --> 39:18.040
convinced the Governor that the
appointment shouldn't go to a Jew.

39:18.520 --> 39:22.160
It was the most painful
moment of my career.

39:22.160 --> 39:26.000
   My husband could be so blind.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
I'm afraid it won't mean
anything to you now, but I'm sorry.

39:30.520 --> 39:34.520
I won't disturb you any further.

39:37.800 --> 39:41.800
I feel good. I'm so relieved Pat's
tumour is benign and treatable.

39:42.280 --> 39:45.960
This whole magilla with the
gorilla has been really a nightmare.

39:45.960 --> 39:49.120
If it weren't for you, Elliot, I
don't know how I'd have handled it.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.440
Well, it was very
important for me to help.

39:51.440 --> 39:55.440
I wish I could have done more.

39:55.560 --> 39:59.000
I really like you.
A lot. Really.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.520
           Oh, Elliott.

40:00.520 --> 40:03.040
  You're different from most men.

40:03.040 --> 40:07.040
I knew that as soon as I met
you in the emergency room.

40:07.160 --> 40:11.160
You're sensitive. When I'm with you,
I forget I'm with a man.

40:11.520 --> 40:13.080
Thanks(!)

40:13.080 --> 40:17.080
I once had a relationship
with this Quebecian guy named Guy.

40:17.480 --> 40:19.120
        I really loved him.

40:19.120 --> 40:22.920
I thought we'd spend
our lives together.

40:22.920 --> 40:26.920
Then one day I let him out for
a walk and he never came back.

40:27.120 --> 40:31.120
I thought he got hit by a car, but
I finally realised he'd just strayed
into another yard.

40:33.840 --> 40:37.840
Well, it hasn't been a great year
for me relationship-wise either.

40:38.240 --> 40:40.440
        That's what I mean.

40:40.440 --> 40:43.040
  Pets are much less complicated.

40:43.040 --> 40:47.040
You feed them and you rub their
stomachs and in return, you get
boundless affection.

40:48.640 --> 40:52.640
Yet, but once in a while, don't you
feel like you're missing something?

40:53.320 --> 40:56.640
THUNDER

40:56.640 --> 40:59.600
I'm willing to give
humans another try.

40:59.600 --> 41:01.920
     I hope you find someone.

41:01.920 --> 41:03.920
No, I meant...

41:03.920 --> 41:07.920
      I know what you meant.

41:07.920 --> 41:11.920
I've got to get back to Pat and Dick.

41:12.720 --> 41:13.960
           Bye, Elliot.

41:13.960 --> 41:15.480
Bye.

41:15.480 --> 41:19.480
THUNDER

41:32.200 --> 41:36.200
Can I have that? Thanks.

41:38.320 --> 41:42.320
Hi, Clancy. ..Pete.

41:42.680 --> 41:45.880
Just came in to see how
the old boy was holding up.

41:45.880 --> 41:49.880
Pete kept whining about his daddy, so
I brought him in, and there they are.

41:50.240 --> 41:53.360
I heard Jack didn't learn to
speak till he was 13 years old.

41:53.360 --> 41:54.720
               Yep.

41:54.720 --> 41:58.720
Then again, I didn't have much
to say till I hit puberty myself.

41:59.120 --> 42:03.120
             Finished.

42:03.280 --> 42:04.440
Rear Window, right?

42:04.440 --> 42:07.040
Yeah, you're a movie buff,
you're well-watched.

42:07.040 --> 42:10.640
Well, I always felt safe in
the darkness of a theatre.

42:10.640 --> 42:13.520
Tucked away on the balcony
with a girl.

42:13.520 --> 42:16.360
Fantasy of romance.

42:16.360 --> 42:20.080
Do people only live happily ever
after in the movies?

42:20.080 --> 42:24.080
Don't ask me, my favourite
flick was Bonnie and Clyde.
Get Pete home to bed.

42:25.800 --> 42:29.760
Wash my hair, gotta do the dishes,
study, it's a great life.

42:29.760 --> 42:33.760
What about dinner?

42:33.840 --> 42:34.880
    I thought you were engaged.

42:34.880 --> 42:38.760
    I thought you were engaged.
Well, disengaged.

42:38.760 --> 42:41.000
 Yeah. I could do with some pizza.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.760
              On me.

42:42.760 --> 42:46.760
With this little rug rat at the
table, I think it'll be on everyone!

42:52.760 --> 42:55.040
I want my mother to
have that surgery.

42:55.040 --> 42:58.160
Then you have a problem.
She's against the whole thing.

42:58.160 --> 43:00.440
Well, then it's up to us to
change her mind. My family

43:00.440 --> 43:03.840
needs that woman alive. She's the
balance that keeps us all afloat.

43:03.840 --> 43:07.000
If you talk to her and she tells
me to operate, then I'll do it.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.240
               Fine.

43:09.240 --> 43:12.440
In my business, we have an
obligation to take risks.

43:12.440 --> 43:16.440
Especially if it involves the
improvement of the quality of  even a
single life.

43:17.720 --> 43:20.000
I'd stand up to my whole
constituency if I thought

43:20.000 --> 43:23.000
they didn't understand the long-term
effects of a piece of legislation.

43:23.000 --> 43:27.000
Now that may be politically risky,
but I believe in the greater good.

43:27.600 --> 43:29.240
That's a pretty speech, but
what has it got to do with me?

43:29.240 --> 43:32.400
That's a pretty speech, but
what has it got to do with me?
Dr Craig, I've had a chance
to stroll round the grounds.

43:32.400 --> 43:35.200
You've got potholes in the
parking lot, outdated elevators,

43:35.200 --> 43:39.160
let's face it, St Eligius is
in dire need of renovation.

43:39.160 --> 43:43.160
You help me convince my mother and
I'll see to it that this hospital
gets a boost from Washington.

43:45.880 --> 43:47.120
You don't like to lose, do you?

43:47.120 --> 43:49.920
You don't like to lose, do you?
           I never lose.

43:49.920 --> 43:52.160
You mind if we make
a quick stop first?

43:52.160 --> 43:56.160
I want to drop this savings
bond off at Mrs Tillman's rooms.

43:56.960 --> 43:58.280
Elliott, what happened?

43:58.280 --> 44:01.360
My picnic in the park, someone
left the cake out in the rain.

44:01.360 --> 44:02.400
Did you have a good time?

44:02.400 --> 44:06.400
        Oh, yeah(!) Great.

44:27.960 --> 44:30.360
I was coming down

I brought this in to
remind you of the Cape.

         Oh, it's lovely.

It's my wife's work.

Yes, she is, thank you.

 I don't pretend that this gesture

45:05.720 --> 45:08.080
can make up for your years of pain.

45:08.080 --> 45:12.080
I appreciate the effort.
