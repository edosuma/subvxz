WEBVTT

00:18.900 --> 00:22.266
We're mining on
the Indian River,
but this license's expiring.

00:22.266 --> 00:25.500
What we don't mine
this year...

00:25.500 --> 00:29.333
I never get a chance to,
so it's going to be
a struggle.

00:29.333 --> 00:31.367
We're definitely going
to fight trying to get
that done.

00:31.367 --> 00:34.367
After a meteoric
rise to the top,

00:34.367 --> 00:38.567
28-year-old Parker Schnabel
may have finally bitten off

00:38.567 --> 00:40.734
more than he can chew.

00:40.734 --> 00:43.467
He's torn between
running a new operation

00:43.467 --> 00:46.967
in Alaska and helping
his crew run more ground

00:46.967 --> 00:49.533
than ever before in the Yukon.

00:49.533 --> 00:52.634
I'm hoping here that
we can, you know,

00:52.634 --> 00:56.266
put this place to bed nice
and it would be a real shame

00:56.266 --> 00:57.634
to leave anything behind.

00:59.066 --> 01:01.533
Over two-thirds
into the season,

01:01.533 --> 01:07.000
Parker's mined nearly
5,000 ounces of Klondike Gold,

01:07.000 --> 01:10.300
but he's currently running
at half capacity.

01:11.667 --> 01:14.900
The main thing here
is we've got to get Big Red

01:14.900 --> 01:15.767
up and running.

01:15.767 --> 01:17.367
Like it's been down
for two weeks

01:17.367 --> 01:21.367
and we've got a lot of
sluicing still to do.

01:24.333 --> 01:28.033
The Klondike crew
just turned a big corner.

01:28.033 --> 01:32.233
After moving two million yards
of dirt over four months,

01:32.233 --> 01:38.100
the final section, the 24-acre
runway cut, is down to pay.

01:38.100 --> 01:41.567
If they can sluice it all
before winter hits,

01:41.567 --> 01:47.700
it could net another
$3.5 million in gold.

01:48.133 --> 01:49.800
What's happening?

01:49.800 --> 01:52.233
Liam is flying back
over to Alaska,

01:52.233 --> 01:53.834
so I'm hitching
a ride with him.

01:53.834 --> 01:56.834
I was hoping to stick
around a few more days,
but I shouldn't be gone long.

01:56.834 --> 01:58.433
But I just wanted to make
sure you guys were all good

01:58.433 --> 02:01.100
and didn't have any concerns
or questions.

02:01.100 --> 02:03.634
The biggest concern
I have is just getting Big Red
up and running.

02:03.634 --> 02:05.634
And every day it's sitting
there is one day later

02:05.634 --> 02:08.133
we're going to have to try
and make it sluice
when it's cold.

02:08.133 --> 02:09.767
- Yeah.
- Yeah, hopefully by the time

02:09.767 --> 02:12.266
you're back,
it's up and running.

02:12.266 --> 02:15.000
- All right, man, later.
Thanks, guys.
- Have fun.

02:16.700 --> 02:19.133
He wants to sluice
it all, he doesn't want
to leave anything behind.

02:19.133 --> 02:21.000
We've been here
for a few years.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.533
- That's crazy.
- 50 different
wash plant setups.

02:23.533 --> 02:25.200
We got to get Big Red
back running,

02:25.200 --> 02:27.166
- but looks like that's
on you and me.
- Yeah.

02:27.166 --> 02:28.400
Later, man.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.800
To get Big Red
running before Parker returns,

02:31.800 --> 02:35.300
Mitch and Tyson need
to transport it in sections

02:35.300 --> 02:38.533
from the Bear Cut
to the Runway Cut.

02:38.533 --> 02:42.266
First task, move
the 10-ton hopper feeder.

02:44.734 --> 02:47.133
Come on, come on, come on.

02:47.133 --> 02:48.467
No. No.

02:51.166 --> 02:53.600
This thing's been sitting
for too long, man.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.700
- Yeah.
- Got some roots here now.

02:55.700 --> 02:58.133
It made itself a nice home,
that's for sure.

03:06.100 --> 03:09.066
- Try again.
- It's settled in,

03:09.066 --> 03:11.200
it's making it difficult
to get the truck
underneath it.

03:17.266 --> 03:19.166
Man it was almost there.

03:19.166 --> 03:22.800
With the truck
unable to fit under
the hopper feeder,

03:22.800 --> 03:26.166
Mitch calls in a loader
to raise up the hopper.

03:28.467 --> 03:29.867
Got 'em in.

03:31.500 --> 03:32.667
Hop up.

03:41.266 --> 03:42.500
We're good to go.

03:44.133 --> 03:48.000
Right now we're just adding
some cribbing underneath
the hopper here

03:48.000 --> 03:51.166
to allow us to get the tractor
underneath it.

04:08.734 --> 04:11.433
Got her, had to
knock the dust off it.

04:11.433 --> 04:12.900
Some days you got
to just get after it.

04:12.900 --> 04:14.467
Yeah, get a little ramroddy.

04:14.467 --> 04:17.467
Oh, man, well it
just kept sinking here,
we weren't gaining on it.

04:17.467 --> 04:18.367
No.

04:18.367 --> 04:20.033
We got our hopper feeder
hooked up,

04:20.033 --> 04:21.800
now it's just a matter
of getting it down to the cut.

04:29.900 --> 04:32.767
Well we got the feeder in,
now we'll get the radial
stacker in place.

04:36.333 --> 04:38.333
Sooner we can get Big Red
up and running,

04:38.333 --> 04:40.533
the better off we'll be.

04:40.533 --> 04:42.266
How'd that go?
Looked pretty smooth?

04:42.266 --> 04:45.500
- Yeah, didn't get hung up,
so that's good.
- Nice.

04:47.300 --> 04:51.233
Now we're going to go back
for the shaker deck.

04:51.233 --> 04:55.667
Big Red
has been sluicing Indian River
pay dirt for nine years,

04:55.667 --> 04:58.567
mining almost 30,000 ounces,

04:58.567 --> 05:02.400
almost 50 million dollars
of gold.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.100
Well, man, this is what
it's all about,

05:04.100 --> 05:06.700
one last ride for Big Red
going down this valley here.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.533
It's looking good, Mitch.

05:19.266 --> 05:21.300
One more big piece
of the puzzle here,

05:21.300 --> 05:22.734
the picture's starting to
come together,

05:22.734 --> 05:26.700
we'll get the sluice
runs next to it
and, uh, we're gaining on it.

05:33.533 --> 05:35.467
Right now we're just flying
these sluice runs

05:35.467 --> 05:37.634
like a magic carpet here.

05:47.767 --> 05:50.533
The sluice runs around
in the last corner here,

05:50.533 --> 05:52.066
heading to the new
wash plant pad.

06:00.333 --> 06:01.567
Come on, baby.

06:04.367 --> 06:05.667
Don't get crazy now.

06:08.467 --> 06:11.033
Yeah, keep on coming,
man, it's looking nice.

06:26.500 --> 06:29.700
Next, the 100 foot
radial stacker

06:29.700 --> 06:31.567
is edged into position.

06:33.900 --> 06:36.767
Well, man, I'd say
we about got her.

06:36.767 --> 06:38.734
- Nice work.
- You too, man.

06:38.734 --> 06:41.567
She is in, get these belts rolling.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.567
- Start throwing
some dirt at her.
- Yeah.

06:49.033 --> 06:53.000
Final task, fire up
Big Red's pump and deliver

06:53.000 --> 06:56.834
1500 gallons of water
a minute to the plant.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.233
Waiting on the water.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.166
We'll have to figure
out what's going on

07:15.166 --> 07:17.000
with Big Red's
water pump here.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.767
A lot of old components,
that water pump is...

07:20.767 --> 07:24.166
it's called Franken-pump
'cause it's a bunch
of different parts.

07:24.166 --> 07:26.066
No, it doesn't want
to play ball.

07:28.066 --> 07:30.600
Oh, I just heard some
air leaking.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.533
You can hear it, yeah.

07:32.533 --> 07:35.634
You can see we've got
a connection
in our suction hose,

07:35.634 --> 07:37.233
everything is taking
a beating here.

07:37.233 --> 07:38.867
We've got duct tape
on the suction hose

07:38.867 --> 07:41.533
and it's, uh, getting
pretty weathered.

07:41.533 --> 07:43.066
Yeah, that's a big guy here.

07:45.967 --> 07:49.300
We're going to need
to take a look at this.
We've got definite air leak.

07:57.867 --> 08:00.867
- What do we got?
- We've got an O-ring.

08:00.867 --> 08:04.700
A faulty O-ring,
worth just a couple of bucks,

08:04.700 --> 08:06.967
is causing a loss of pressure,

08:06.967 --> 08:10.266
stopping the pump sending
water to the wash plant.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.900
Do we give her the flip
and try it?

08:14.900 --> 08:16.500
It's like when all
your laundry is dirty

08:16.500 --> 08:17.834
and you've got to make it
one more day.

08:17.834 --> 08:20.634
Just do the, turn the socks
inside out, right?

08:20.634 --> 08:22.200
Clean the side out.

08:22.200 --> 08:25.667
The O-ring
is damaged on just one side.

08:25.667 --> 08:27.734
We'll put the bad spot
at the bottom.

08:27.734 --> 08:30.367
Mitch hopes simply
turning it around

08:30.367 --> 08:34.867
will create the airtight
seal the pump needs
to function.

08:34.867 --> 08:37.300
Once it gets water in
there, hopefully it'll, uh...

08:37.300 --> 08:39.066
- Fill it with grease?
- Yeah.

08:50.367 --> 08:53.033
We've got our water pump fired
up here for Big Red.

08:54.533 --> 08:55.700
Yes.

08:58.266 --> 09:00.834
Well, here we go,
the shaker deck's shaking,

09:00.834 --> 09:03.300
the conveyors are spinning,
time to throw some dirt at it.

09:05.533 --> 09:08.734
First bucket of pay on
the last cut for Big Red.

09:08.734 --> 09:09.900
Yeah, buddy.

09:32.567 --> 09:35.266
Right now,
we are in a war for gold.

09:35.266 --> 09:37.200
I set a massive goal
this season,

09:37.200 --> 09:38.867
five times what
we got last season.

09:38.867 --> 09:41.000
That's what we need
to strive for.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.300
Third year
mine boss, Fred Lewis,

09:43.300 --> 09:46.433
has pulled in 93 ounces
of gold.

09:46.433 --> 09:50.100
And while he's well short
of his 500 ounce goal,

09:50.100 --> 09:52.867
he is closing in on
last season's total

09:52.867 --> 09:54.667
of 110 ounces.

09:54.667 --> 09:58.133
We've got pretty decent gold
right here in the Freedom Cut,

09:58.133 --> 10:00.967
but gold this season
has not been as good
as we had hoped.

10:04.467 --> 10:08.600
After hauling in
21 ounces,
their best gold weigh,

10:08.600 --> 10:13.600
Fred's crew believe
they have a shot at saving
their season.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.967
Last week we definitely hit
a pay streak 'cause

10:15.967 --> 10:17.834
that's the best gold weigh
we've had as a team.

10:17.834 --> 10:21.433
That is a great achievement
and our guys definitely got

10:21.433 --> 10:22.800
a boost in morale.

10:24.934 --> 10:27.100
You know, I've got everything
on the line right now.

10:27.100 --> 10:29.600
Just get every flake
of gold through that
wash plant

10:29.600 --> 10:32.266
and hopefully at the end
of the season,
pad my guys' pockets

10:32.266 --> 10:34.567
and get the [bleep] out
of here.

10:44.834 --> 10:47.233
Hey, Fred, what's up?

10:50.667 --> 10:52.367
I'm coming to the mercy
of you.

10:53.467 --> 10:55.266
You know my door's just down.

10:55.266 --> 10:59.066
- So I'm coming to you to see
if you can help me out.
- Yeah.

10:59.066 --> 11:02.900
Last week,
23-year-old
Brandon Clayton suffered

11:02.900 --> 11:06.400
a major setback when
his D8 dozer died.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.166
We need to get it fixed
or we're [bleep].

11:13.133 --> 11:18.367
Earlier
in the season, Brandon lent
his dozer to Fred.

11:19.800 --> 11:22.233
If you can let me borrow that,
I'll let you use my dozer

11:22.233 --> 11:23.834
once it gets here,
kind of desperate.

11:23.834 --> 11:26.266
Right. Yeah. Okay.

11:26.266 --> 11:27.800
- I really appreciate it.
- Sure.

11:29.834 --> 11:33.066
Now, Brandon's
cashing in the favor.

11:33.066 --> 11:36.467
I think right now we can
let you use it for a day.

11:36.467 --> 11:37.934
- Okay.
- We owe you that one time.

11:37.934 --> 11:39.467
I'm going to give it
to you for free.

11:39.467 --> 11:41.700
- Just understand we've got
to be super careful with it.
- Yeah.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.533
Got to take care
of that puppy.

11:48.900 --> 11:51.133
We waited so long
to get this thing

11:51.133 --> 11:54.700
and to loan it out,
it should be used

11:54.700 --> 11:57.834
on our cut, not someone
else's cut right now.

11:57.834 --> 12:01.000
I'm making a decision to honor
our deal with the Claytons.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.734
I know they're our rivals
and we do have a bet going,

12:03.734 --> 12:05.166
but, you know, we make deals.

12:05.166 --> 12:06.667
You've got to live up to them.

12:06.667 --> 12:08.333
This is about being
a man of my word.

12:08.333 --> 12:11.867
Whether or not my guys agree
this is a good idea,

12:11.867 --> 12:14.033
it could help us later
on down the road.

12:19.667 --> 12:21.533
I can't wait to start
stripping Golden Acres.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.300
We're ready to [bleep] go.

12:23.300 --> 12:26.667
This dozer is definitely
a bit bigger than ours,

12:26.667 --> 12:30.734
but it's quite the unit, man.

12:30.734 --> 12:32.400
It's definitely an antique.

12:32.400 --> 12:36.934
It's basically a museum
on track, so you've got
to be pretty careful with it.

12:37.433 --> 12:38.734
We'll try her out

12:39.700 --> 12:41.333
and we'll hope for the best.

12:54.767 --> 12:57.333
Oh, [bleep]. What the
going on there?

13:05.567 --> 13:07.166
Oh, well, that's not good.

13:08.700 --> 13:11.033
Well, I'm going to have
to walk it back to the plant,

13:11.033 --> 13:13.533
this carrier roller
has swamped.

13:13.533 --> 13:15.467
And I can't run it like that.

13:15.467 --> 13:16.934
Fred's probably not
going to be happy,

13:16.934 --> 13:19.700
but we'll see what
he has to say, I guess.

13:19.700 --> 13:22.500
Hopefully they're not too mad.
I know it's their baby.

13:35.467 --> 13:39.333
I don't want to say I told you
so to Fred, but I told you so.

13:39.333 --> 13:41.700
I mean, I'm mad
that it's broke.

13:41.700 --> 13:43.467
I'm not a happy camper at all.

13:44.934 --> 13:48.400
Less than
three hours after
Fred's crew loaned

13:48.400 --> 13:51.533
their only dozer
to neighbor Brandon Clayton,

13:51.533 --> 13:54.567
it's been returned, busted.

14:05.166 --> 14:09.233
Carrier rollers
smoothly guide
the dozer's tracks,

14:09.233 --> 14:12.033
but the pedestal
that supports one
of the rollers

14:12.033 --> 14:13.900
is cracked,

14:13.900 --> 14:17.333
causing the carrier roller
to fall out of position

14:17.333 --> 14:20.967
and the track to become
dangerously loose.

14:20.967 --> 14:23.834
If we had to call a mechanic
to come in and fix this,

14:23.834 --> 14:25.900
as you're looking at
probably here in the Yukon.

14:25.900 --> 14:29.367
Probably right around
like 165 bucks an hour,

14:30.767 --> 14:33.634
which would be a pretty
big cost.

14:33.634 --> 14:35.433
It'll be a few grand
to fix this up.

14:43.700 --> 14:46.800
Buzz will have to
source a replacement pedestal

14:46.800 --> 14:49.333
to get the dozer back
up and running.

14:51.000 --> 14:52.500
Come here and look here.

14:55.333 --> 14:56.900
See that pan?

14:56.900 --> 14:58.266
- Yeah.
- Right?

14:59.333 --> 15:00.700
How's it going, guys?

15:00.700 --> 15:04.433
- Well, slowly.
- Holy [bleep].

15:04.433 --> 15:06.567
- The, uh...
- Isn't there supposed
to be something here?

15:06.567 --> 15:08.367
So this wasn't
a little fix, was it?

15:08.367 --> 15:10.400
Not really.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.333
This is at the worst case
scenario for us.

15:12.333 --> 15:13.967
This is our moneymaker.

15:13.967 --> 15:16.166
Without this, we're [bleep].

15:16.166 --> 15:18.233
A lot of ground ahead
that needs to be stripped

15:18.233 --> 15:20.233
and torn and ripped up, and...

15:21.900 --> 15:25.467
I just... we can't afford
having this dozer down.

15:25.467 --> 15:28.900
- Yeah.
- With the broken
dozer taking Buzz and JB out

15:28.900 --> 15:31.634
of the cut, the crew
can't deliver fresh pay

15:31.634 --> 15:33.500
to the plant.

15:33.500 --> 15:37.567
We've got to have
to bite the hard bullet here
and shut the plant down.

15:37.567 --> 15:39.967
This is my finances.
This is my home.

15:39.967 --> 15:41.734
This is everything
my family's put into it.

15:41.734 --> 15:43.033
But right now we're [bleep].

15:43.033 --> 15:44.200
Shut it down.

15:52.500 --> 15:54.433
- Hey, Stuart.
- Yo.

15:54.433 --> 15:56.800
- I need your assistance.
- What are we doing?

15:56.800 --> 16:01.166
Ah, I guess a little
good cop, bad cop.

16:01.166 --> 16:03.767
- Okay.
- I just talked to Buzz
about the dozer.

16:03.767 --> 16:05.133
Oh, yeah, what is
going on with it?

16:05.133 --> 16:09.300
It's still not fixed.
We're analyzing this
whole transaction

16:09.300 --> 16:12.000
with Brandon, and, uh...

16:12.000 --> 16:13.867
we're going to have to go tell
him he can't use it anymore.

16:13.867 --> 16:17.133
To me this is really tricky
because we're still trying
to build a relationship

16:17.133 --> 16:19.734
with Brandon.
We're still trying to be
the better neighbors here.

16:19.734 --> 16:21.233
Oh, yeah.
I fully agree with it.

16:21.233 --> 16:23.900
You know, I mean,
we were kind of just being
the good neighbor,

16:23.900 --> 16:26.567
and he was in a really,
really bad spot where

16:26.567 --> 16:29.600
his season was actually at
the point where it might
be over,

16:29.600 --> 16:31.734
and we lent our helping hand,

16:31.734 --> 16:33.233
and we kind of got
for it.

16:33.233 --> 16:36.066
- Let me lead.
We'll play it soft.
- Mm-hmm.

16:36.066 --> 16:38.634
- If he gives us any tension,
we'll just bring up the facts
- Yeah.

16:38.634 --> 16:40.367
and be like, look,
this isn't personal.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.166
- Yeah.
- This is a business decision.

16:42.166 --> 16:44.166
- Uh-huh.
- We're still here to
help when we can,

16:44.166 --> 16:46.100
- Yeah.
- but we can't help you
with the dozer anymore.

16:46.100 --> 16:48.133
- Yeah, absolutely.
- All right?
All right, let's do it.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.734
I started this season,
came up here
to shut down the mine,

17:09.734 --> 17:11.300
sell these claims,

17:11.967 --> 17:15.634
and now we're mining again.

17:15.634 --> 17:19.400
Veteran miner
Dave Turin is throwing
the dice

17:19.400 --> 17:22.333
one more time before
he hangs up

17:22.333 --> 17:24.166
his gold mining boots.

17:25.567 --> 17:28.700
He wants to prove his claim
has 10 years' worth

17:28.700 --> 17:34.333
of mining with the potential
to produce $10 million
worth of gold.

17:38.266 --> 17:41.834
So I have to prove
that this place is not a dud,

17:41.834 --> 17:44.166
and I got to prove it
to Nathan and Jason that

17:44.166 --> 17:47.100
there's virgin ground
with gold on it.

17:47.100 --> 17:51.000
Dave hopes
to sell it to his most
loyal crew members,

17:51.000 --> 17:55.834
operator Jason Sanchez
and mechanic Nathan Clark,

17:55.834 --> 17:57.934
for $1 million.

17:57.934 --> 18:00.433
You know, I've always wanted
to run my own operation.

18:00.433 --> 18:03.500
It's a risk, but we can pull
a good gold right here,

18:03.500 --> 18:04.867
and it can be life-changing.

18:10.800 --> 18:14.900
Team Turin wants 30 ounces
from the Three Amigos

18:14.900 --> 18:18.600
cut to prove the ground,
cover costs,

18:18.600 --> 18:20.700
and pocket some gold,

18:20.700 --> 18:25.400
but so far they've banked
less than six ounces.

18:25.400 --> 18:30.634
You know, for three guys,
5.58 ounces, it's not bad.

18:30.634 --> 18:33.266
In the end, I want everybody
to walk out of here with gold

18:33.266 --> 18:36.100
in their pockets to help cover
the costs and the costs

18:36.100 --> 18:38.000
of coming up here to shut
the claims down,

18:38.000 --> 18:40.533
but I need the gold
to keep coming.

18:43.700 --> 18:47.533
Dave's convinced
there's much larger
gold deposits

18:47.533 --> 18:49.333
still to be discovered.

18:49.333 --> 18:51.734
We go deep. We're starting
to hit those big rocks.

18:51.734 --> 18:53.066
That's where
the gold's living.

19:00.467 --> 19:03.800
To help convince
Jason and Nathan to buy,

19:03.800 --> 19:06.634
Dave is also throwing
into the deal

19:06.634 --> 19:10.367
his half a million-dollar
wash plant, the Eagle.

19:12.634 --> 19:15.967
Remote-controlled
with tank-like tracks,

19:15.967 --> 19:19.900
it's capable of sluicing
180 yards an hour,

19:19.900 --> 19:23.867
making it a mean, lean,
all-terrain,

19:23.867 --> 19:26.667
money-making machine.

19:26.667 --> 19:30.634
I do know what
it takes to come into
a mine empty-handed,

19:30.634 --> 19:32.033
and that's not the case here.

19:32.033 --> 19:37.367
We would buy the wash plant,
pumps, excavators, loader.

19:37.367 --> 19:40.066
Basically, this is
a turnkey operation.

19:43.333 --> 19:45.934
Jason digs pay
in the excavator.

19:49.734 --> 19:52.767
Dave and Nathan haul
the pay to the wash plant.

19:54.100 --> 19:58.166
This is the first time
I've ever mined
with this few a guys,

19:58.166 --> 20:01.533
so, you know, it kind of goes
to show

20:01.533 --> 20:04.600
if you got some competent,
really good people,

20:04.600 --> 20:06.600
you can do it with
a small crew.

20:08.667 --> 20:10.567
It kind of proves
to those guys, too,

20:10.567 --> 20:12.800
that if they want to buy
this, they could,

20:12.800 --> 20:16.634
you know, work on this
with a small crew.

20:16.634 --> 20:19.400
It's really cheap.
We'll pull some decent
numbers out of here.

20:19.400 --> 20:22.400
As long as the ground
pays out, we'll do all right.

20:22.400 --> 20:25.000
I'm a happy, happy, happy boy
right now.

20:27.533 --> 20:30.634
Jason's getting into
some big rocks right now.

20:33.333 --> 20:36.634
Okie-dokie, here comes
the big rocks.

20:36.634 --> 20:39.300
I hope we find a lot of gold
with all that big rocks.

20:40.133 --> 20:42.800
Me, too.
I'm hoping, hoping, hoping.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.367
This is going to be
so exciting.

20:48.567 --> 20:50.400
You hate to throw those
kind of rocks

20:50.400 --> 20:52.300
on your wash plant,
but there should be

20:52.300 --> 20:54.333
a lot of big gold around
those big rocks,

20:54.333 --> 20:55.834
so that's what
we're hoping for.

21:16.600 --> 21:19.567
This conveyor quit, Nate.
I'm not sure what's up.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.166
The belt conveyor stopped.

21:24.166 --> 21:27.433
- Did he just say
the belt stopped?
- Aw, [bleep].

21:34.634 --> 21:35.934
Just one big one?

21:38.767 --> 21:41.600
Looks like we got a rock
in the tail pulley.

21:44.066 --> 21:47.834
is in there,
something fierce, y'all.

21:50.567 --> 21:53.967
The coarse
tailing's conveyor is jammed.

21:55.767 --> 21:58.300
A rock is wedged
between the belt

21:58.300 --> 22:00.634
and the pulley that
rotates the conveyor.

22:05.367 --> 22:06.533
There you are.

22:10.367 --> 22:12.033
She's got to be almost out.

22:12.033 --> 22:13.567
- Keep prying?
- No, hold--

22:13.567 --> 22:14.600
Okay.

22:14.600 --> 22:17.066
We're going to have
to loosen the belt,

22:17.066 --> 22:19.900
try to spin that tail pulley
in the belt,

22:19.900 --> 22:21.467
so it'll kick that rock out.

22:28.200 --> 22:32.066
Dave has to spin
the tail pulley by hand.

22:37.133 --> 22:39.100
- Keep loosening?
- Yeah, no you're good.

22:39.100 --> 22:40.767
- Good?
- She's moving.

22:45.967 --> 22:47.266
Ah, got her.

22:49.634 --> 22:50.734
Man.

22:54.166 --> 22:55.367
Okay.

22:55.367 --> 22:57.400
So this is the rock
that was wedged in there,

22:57.400 --> 23:00.800
but the way it was wedged
was bound into that belt

23:00.800 --> 23:03.233
so much that we couldn't
get it to roll

23:03.233 --> 23:06.500
or flip to the flat point
to get it to come out.

23:12.166 --> 23:13.734
- Hey, Jason.
- Yes, sir?

23:13.734 --> 23:16.967
- Come here.
- There's some
little pieces in there.

23:16.967 --> 23:18.667
It sure looks like it,
doesn't it?

23:18.667 --> 23:20.200
I'll bet that's gold.

23:22.333 --> 23:25.266
- Now that's gold.
- Without a doubt, 100%.

23:25.266 --> 23:29.367
This rock broke open

23:29.367 --> 23:31.100
and there's a little bit
of gold in it.

23:31.100 --> 23:32.967
So we're going to hang on
to that one.

23:32.967 --> 23:34.567
Fire the plant up.

23:35.567 --> 23:36.767
Eagle coming on.

24:00.500 --> 24:03.400
It's kind of frustrating,
we are really limited

24:03.400 --> 24:05.200
on the amount of time
that we're going to be here.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.300
I need to get gold right now.

24:18.066 --> 24:22.100
I knew that loaning out
the dozer was probably
a risk,

24:22.100 --> 24:24.166
but it's caused us
to lose some gold

24:24.166 --> 24:26.500
at this point
and some sluicing.

24:26.500 --> 24:29.734
Fred Lewis'
wash plant has been shut down

24:29.734 --> 24:33.800
for 24 hours after
Brandon Clayton damaged

24:33.800 --> 24:35.166
his dozer,

24:35.166 --> 24:38.166
leaving Fred unable to strip ground

24:38.166 --> 24:41.634
and access new pay
to feed the plant.

24:55.800 --> 24:57.066
Brandon.

24:59.934 --> 25:02.000
I wanted to come over
and talk about the dozer.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.333
Yeah, sorry
about that.

25:05.233 --> 25:07.266
But I don't think we can let
you guys borrow it anymore.

25:08.600 --> 25:11.066
- And it's not personal.
- Right.

25:11.066 --> 25:12.867
I don't want to be
a bad neighbor,

25:12.867 --> 25:15.333
- Yeah.
- but at the same time,
I've got to run the business

25:15.333 --> 25:17.800
and I just don't see us
having time to let you
borrow it again.

25:17.800 --> 25:20.300
- Right.
- It's just I can't afford
to be down again.

25:20.300 --> 25:21.900
Do you guys need help
fixing it? Or...

25:21.900 --> 25:23.634
Right now we've got
the part.

25:23.634 --> 25:25.500
- Buzz is going to get it up
and running today,
- All right.

25:25.500 --> 25:26.433
so we're good.

25:26.433 --> 25:27.734
Yeah, yeah, that's cool.

25:27.734 --> 25:29.700
I mean, we didn't mean
to make it break either.

25:29.700 --> 25:30.967
No, no.

25:30.967 --> 25:32.300
Water under the bridge, bro.

25:34.367 --> 25:36.033
All right, I'll get out
of your hair.

25:36.033 --> 25:37.200
- See you later.
- Later, brother.

25:37.200 --> 25:38.734
See you, dude.
See you, Stuart.

25:45.367 --> 25:50.667
This carrier roller
pedestal, it got busted off
all twisted up,

25:50.667 --> 25:53.400
so I had to drive to the other
side of the territory.

25:53.400 --> 25:56.667
This took me all
freaking day to get it.

25:56.667 --> 26:01.266
And now we're... I'll be in
the process of getting it
back on.

26:01.266 --> 26:03.166
To get the dozer up
and running,

26:03.166 --> 26:05.767
Buzz sourced
a replacement pedestal

26:05.767 --> 26:08.967
150 miles away in Keno.

26:08.967 --> 26:10.634
Unfortunately, when
this happened,

26:10.634 --> 26:11.800
three bolts broke.

26:11.800 --> 26:15.900
The convenience of normal life
isn't really here.

26:15.900 --> 26:19.400
You end up doing
a lot of bush fixes.

26:19.400 --> 26:21.867
We don't really have
time to [bleep] around.

26:25.200 --> 26:29.667
First, he needs
to place the new pedestal
back on the frame.

26:37.367 --> 26:39.133
Oh, it looks good.

26:39.700 --> 26:41.533
This is a pedestal.

26:41.533 --> 26:45.367
Then secure
the carrier roller
onto the pedestal.

26:47.967 --> 26:50.066
Everybody watch your toes.

26:56.467 --> 26:57.900
It's heavy.

26:59.834 --> 27:01.467
We're just going
to lock her down.

27:06.600 --> 27:10.066
Bolt down
the pedestal with
the one remaining bolt.

27:10.066 --> 27:13.734
So I'll just get the one bolt
that I can put in, in,

27:13.734 --> 27:16.600
weld it down, and get to work.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.834
And weld it
to the frame.

27:23.400 --> 27:25.867
After I weld it,
things should be good to go.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.400
Buzz...

27:33.233 --> 27:35.767
- how's it going?
- Don't slam it around.

27:35.767 --> 27:37.200
Everything should be fine.

27:37.200 --> 27:39.066
That's why you're the only one
driving it.

27:39.066 --> 27:40.266
That's right.

27:40.266 --> 27:42.600
So what are you looking at
for time now to get her going?

27:42.600 --> 27:43.834
What time is it?

27:43.834 --> 27:45.667
Like, six o'clock.

27:46.333 --> 27:47.667
6:15.

27:47.667 --> 27:49.934
Oh, I like that. Okay. Good.

27:49.934 --> 27:51.867
'Cause we've got to get going.
We're running out of time.

27:51.867 --> 27:54.367
You know, it's going
to start freezing at night
before we know it here.

27:54.367 --> 27:55.634
- Yeah.
- Love it.

27:57.767 --> 27:58.934
All good.

28:00.133 --> 28:02.634
Hey, now I've got this puppy
all welded up.

28:03.867 --> 28:06.066
Is it going to start?

28:21.200 --> 28:23.767
That's the shiznit
right there.

28:26.400 --> 28:27.834
There we go.

28:36.467 --> 28:37.734
Fire it up.

28:43.166 --> 28:45.500
Sluice is back up
and running again.

28:48.433 --> 28:49.600
We got water.

29:01.300 --> 29:03.400
Seeing that wash plant up
and running right now means

29:03.400 --> 29:04.567
the world to us.

29:04.567 --> 29:06.400
Without somebody like Buzz,
who is always willing

29:06.400 --> 29:09.934
to fix problems and go
the extra mile to make happen,

29:09.934 --> 29:11.300
it wouldn't be possible.

29:11.300 --> 29:14.800
So right now, the heartbeat
of our operation's up
and running.

29:14.800 --> 29:17.533
Got to keep it running
if we're going to achieve
that goal we have.

29:17.533 --> 29:18.800
It's on.

29:29.166 --> 29:31.533
We've been running these
wash plants hard all year,

29:31.533 --> 29:33.800
but we're going to run them
the hardest right now,

29:33.800 --> 29:35.734
right to the finish line.
That's it down there.

29:35.734 --> 29:37.834
Hopefully there's a little
gold in this ground here.

29:39.834 --> 29:42.333
At Parker's
Indian River claim,

29:42.333 --> 29:45.567
foreman Mitch Blaschke
is trying to sluice a mountain

29:45.567 --> 29:49.233
of pay dirt before
the end of the season.

29:49.233 --> 29:54.667
With wash plants Big Red
and Sluicifer both
running 24/7.

29:54.667 --> 29:57.667
To keep the plants fed,
Mitch has elevated

29:57.667 --> 29:59.667
one of his green crew members

29:59.667 --> 30:02.500
from a rock truck to a loader.

30:02.500 --> 30:04.934
We got Evan, trying to train
him up because

30:04.934 --> 30:07.700
he's a young guy
that's really enthusiastic,

30:07.700 --> 30:09.533
wants to be out here learning
the machines

30:09.533 --> 30:12.834
and how to do things,
and he's got a great attitude.

30:23.133 --> 30:25.634
Mitch asked if I wanted
to do some loader today

30:25.634 --> 30:26.900
and I was like...

30:26.900 --> 30:30.667
yeah I do,
that's great.

30:30.667 --> 30:35.033
19-year-old
Evan Kurtz came to
the Klondike Goldfields

30:35.033 --> 30:37.834
in the hope of rising
in the ranks.

30:37.834 --> 30:41.300
When I'm learning new things
I get kind of nervous

30:41.300 --> 30:44.533
and stressful just because
I don't want to
up anything,

30:44.533 --> 30:48.567
but, yeah, there's a lot more
responsibility in a loader.

30:48.567 --> 30:52.200
You've got to be mindful
of everyone around you.

30:52.200 --> 30:56.000
Evan on a loader, I think
he was born for that.

30:56.000 --> 31:00.266
A loader is probably
the hardest thing
to drive

31:00.266 --> 31:04.300
because it's a constant
feeling it.

31:04.300 --> 31:06.867
We'll make a miner out
of him, that's for sure.

31:14.900 --> 31:17.166
Oh [bleep].

31:17.867 --> 31:20.567
What the [bleep] is going on?

31:21.233 --> 31:23.166
Tyson, you got a copy, Tyson?

31:23.166 --> 31:26.266
There's a bunch of rocks
in the sluice runs.

31:26.266 --> 31:27.967
We're going to go ahead
and shut her down.

31:30.900 --> 31:31.900
Hit it!

31:40.533 --> 31:43.834
Parker's due back from Alaska,

31:43.834 --> 31:46.266
Big Red's down, we have
no gold coming in,

31:46.266 --> 31:48.900
no money coming in,
but a lot going out.

31:48.900 --> 31:50.767
We really need to try
and hammer this out

31:50.767 --> 31:53.533
and get it done.
Get this fired back up.

32:08.367 --> 32:10.600
Oh, we got Big Red down
this morning,

32:10.600 --> 32:14.133
it's got a lot of large
material going down
the sluice rung.

32:15.600 --> 32:18.634
At Parker Schnabel's
Airstrip claim,

32:18.634 --> 32:21.900
Mitch and Tyson have had
to shut down Big Red

32:21.900 --> 32:25.567
after Evan spotted rocks
in the sluice runs.

32:25.567 --> 32:27.600
I'm just going to take
a look at it.

32:27.600 --> 32:30.300
You know, you see all
these here?

32:30.300 --> 32:31.967
That means we have
a blown out screen

32:31.967 --> 32:34.233
and it's got to be a pretty
big hole for rocks this size

32:34.233 --> 32:36.667
to be coming in and when
the rocks land in spots

32:36.667 --> 32:38.333
like this, it'll create
dead spots where

32:38.333 --> 32:40.433
the gold isn't being caught, so...

32:40.433 --> 32:42.033
As you can tell the runs
are littered in rocks,

32:42.033 --> 32:44.300
so I'm going to have
to go and hand pick
all these out

32:44.300 --> 32:46.734
and get up in the screen deck
and change that screen.

32:50.533 --> 32:52.166
You know the material
that we're running right now,

32:52.166 --> 32:54.333
as you can see
from the tailings here

32:54.333 --> 32:56.567
is really sharp,
aggressive rock,

32:56.567 --> 32:59.300
so you think about
all that material working

32:59.300 --> 33:02.233
its way across this wash plant
hours and hours a day

33:02.233 --> 33:05.467
and, you know, these screens
are pretty thin to begin with

33:05.467 --> 33:08.367
and then when you go
and work that material
over the top,

33:08.367 --> 33:10.634
eventually it cuts
through 'em, so we're going
to remove

33:10.634 --> 33:11.767
the old screen,

33:11.767 --> 33:14.734
bring the new one in,
get her bolted back up.

33:17.066 --> 33:20.433
The screen deck
meshing separates large rocks

33:20.433 --> 33:24.300
from the finer pay dirt
allowing the gold rich material

33:24.300 --> 33:26.033
to drop through the screens.

33:27.634 --> 33:32.700
But if the screen breaks,
the large rocks fall through
as well.

33:32.700 --> 33:35.767
Once in the sluices,
the rocks block the flow

33:35.767 --> 33:39.467
of water, stopping the riffles
from catching the gold

33:39.467 --> 33:42.033
and washing it out of the end
of the box.

33:46.867 --> 33:48.200
You see it?

33:48.200 --> 33:51.200
Yeah we've got
a bad screen here.
Check that one out the bottom.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.233
Yeah just like that.

34:03.367 --> 34:04.934
It's looking good.

34:10.667 --> 34:12.867
So this is our screen
that we just pulled out

34:12.867 --> 34:15.967
and as you can see,
it's supposed to just have
half inch size holes here,

34:15.967 --> 34:18.200
but once these break,
real big rocks.

34:18.200 --> 34:19.934
They make their way
into the sluice box.

34:22.166 --> 34:24.066
It's been a fight getting
Big Red set up,

34:24.066 --> 34:27.166
but, hopefully,
the fight is over.

34:27.166 --> 34:29.266
- She's fixed.
- Time to fire it up.

34:29.266 --> 34:30.333
It's a good feeling.

34:41.567 --> 34:43.567
You know if Evan hadn't
have spotted this,

34:43.567 --> 34:45.166
more and more material
would have built up

34:45.166 --> 34:47.867
in the sluice runs until
we're doing all this work.

34:47.867 --> 34:50.300
We're washing all
these rocks, but we're not
catching any gold.

34:51.834 --> 34:54.867
Running the plant
by myself knowing that

34:54.867 --> 34:57.233
they trust me to do so.

34:57.233 --> 35:01.166
It's a big step up
and I'm really happy
to be taking it right now.

35:09.834 --> 35:11.400
Just need to keep working
everything on that--

35:11.400 --> 35:13.467
- Hello, guys.
- What up baby?

35:13.467 --> 35:15.734
You got our baby back
in action?

35:15.734 --> 35:16.967
Back up and rolling.

35:16.967 --> 35:18.834
Well, it looks like
you got her turned up.

35:18.834 --> 35:20.834
She's cranking through
the dirt right now

35:20.834 --> 35:23.233
But, man, it just feels
good to have Big Red
back up and running.

35:23.233 --> 35:25.166
Yeah, but you guys got
that done in a hurry.

35:25.166 --> 35:26.500
So that's the final stretch,

35:26.500 --> 35:29.300
we just gotta hunker in
and keep feeding it, huh?

35:29.300 --> 35:32.467
I mean it's pretty wild,
you look down there
and that's the property line.

35:32.467 --> 35:35.233
Definitely a pretty
ambitious season

35:35.233 --> 35:37.900
and thank you, guys,
for making it happen.

35:48.467 --> 35:50.500
We're getting gold,
so that's a good thing.

35:50.500 --> 35:54.000
We got bigger rocks
which means bigger gold

35:54.000 --> 35:55.800
and things are working well.

35:55.800 --> 35:59.600
It's the three amigos,
you just got three
guys working.

36:02.400 --> 36:06.767
Dave Turin is on
a mission to prove
his Glacier Creek claim

36:06.767 --> 36:09.400
is worth its million
dollar price tag

36:09.400 --> 36:12.533
to potential buyers,
Jason and Nathan.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.834
Now if it's profitable,
I don't know,

36:15.834 --> 36:18.367
so you get the gold
on the scale,

36:18.367 --> 36:20.233
it'll make a big decision
on what we're gonna do

36:20.233 --> 36:22.033
if we're gonna buy
this property.

36:32.233 --> 36:34.600
You know, it's going really,
really smooth right now

36:34.600 --> 36:37.467
and that's the scary part,
nothing ever goes smooth
in mining.

36:38.166 --> 36:39.934
Yeah, bring me some pay, Nate.

36:47.033 --> 36:48.700
Oh,

36:48.700 --> 36:52.500
- Nate...
- I, uh, conveyor quit again.

36:52.500 --> 36:54.266
- Kill it, kill it,
kill it, kill it, kill it.
- What?

36:54.967 --> 36:56.233
Kill it, kill it, Jason.

36:58.333 --> 37:01.667
piece of

37:04.767 --> 37:07.533
The coarse tailings
belt has jammed...

37:07.967 --> 37:09.266
once again.

37:15.433 --> 37:20.433
Well, we thought we fixed it,
but we didn't fix it.

37:20.433 --> 37:24.834
Once again, we got
a bunch of [bleep] rocks
in the tail port.

37:26.634 --> 37:29.433
Dave must now clear
the rocks by hand.

37:38.200 --> 37:40.934
Rocks coming off conveyor,
is everybody clear?

37:45.133 --> 37:46.967
That moved a [bleep] ton.

37:51.533 --> 37:53.233
Let me clear the belt out, Dave.

37:54.333 --> 37:55.567
Clear.

38:00.667 --> 38:04.066
It's just a piece of rubber
that keeps flopping open

38:04.066 --> 38:07.233
and the rocks get down
and then they fall into
the tail place.

38:08.333 --> 38:10.000
Yeah it's just wear on
the machine,

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
it wears the rubber out
and then what happens

38:12.000 --> 38:14.934
is you create a little hole
and the little rocks
get in there.

38:14.934 --> 38:17.900
Pretty soon it grows,
now you got a problem.

38:17.900 --> 38:21.934
When you run a million rocks
over rubber,

38:21.934 --> 38:24.266
the rock will always win.

38:24.266 --> 38:26.400
So right now,
we're patching that hole.

38:29.033 --> 38:32.600
A rubber flap
on the edge of the belt
has worn out.

38:32.600 --> 38:35.266
Instead of steering rocks
up the conveyor,

38:35.266 --> 38:38.967
the flaps ripped open,
allowing rocks
to fall through,

38:38.967 --> 38:40.867
jamming the tail pulling.

38:43.033 --> 38:46.600
To get the Eagle back up
and running as fast
as possible,

38:46.600 --> 38:49.667
the team fix a rubber patch
across the gap.

38:58.900 --> 39:01.867
We're fixed, see if
runs that way.

39:01.867 --> 39:03.967
Yeah, you want to turn it on.
Make sure everything's good?

39:03.967 --> 39:04.867
Yeah.

39:17.333 --> 39:19.567
Dave's back
in the game,

39:19.567 --> 39:22.433
but the shutdowns
have cost him eight hours

39:22.433 --> 39:24.500
in vital sluicing time.

39:24.500 --> 39:28.967
Now all he can do is hope
this spot pays out.

39:28.967 --> 39:31.166
You know, Jason and Nathan
want to see some gold.

39:31.166 --> 39:32.600
We're going to try
to find that.

39:43.800 --> 39:46.000
I've been cleaning gold
all day.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.467
About time to take a break.

39:47.467 --> 39:51.033
Chris Doumitt
celebrates his 71st birthday

39:51.033 --> 39:53.800
working on his golf handicap.

39:56.700 --> 39:58.033
Too far.

40:03.934 --> 40:05.567
Oh, just short.

40:06.300 --> 40:07.300
Ah...

40:17.166 --> 40:20.166
Yeah, hole in one, baby.

40:20.166 --> 40:22.367
Don't touch that, it's hot.

40:25.400 --> 40:26.500
Nailed it.

40:36.634 --> 40:38.300
- Hey, Shell.
- Hi, guys.

40:41.133 --> 40:43.000
Tell me it looks great.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.367
I was thinking
it was going to be
a bit more than that.

40:45.367 --> 40:47.900
So what do we got on
in the box, Nate?

40:47.900 --> 40:49.166
About 20 hours on it.

40:49.166 --> 40:51.533
100 yards an hour,
there's 2,000 yards

40:52.400 --> 40:53.667
right there.

40:53.667 --> 40:57.934
Last week,
Team Turin ran 1,400 yards

40:57.934 --> 41:01.300
delivering 5.58 ounces.

41:01.300 --> 41:03.634
This week they've mined deeper,

41:03.634 --> 41:07.467
hitting bigger rocks and Dave
thinks they should pull in

41:07.467 --> 41:10.834
significantly more than
their last weigh.

41:10.834 --> 41:12.100
Now, let's weigh it up.

41:13.900 --> 41:18.133
One, two, three...

41:18.900 --> 41:21.400
four, five, there's six...

41:23.200 --> 41:25.567
6.86 ounces.

41:27.867 --> 41:30.800
Worth $11,000.

41:32.400 --> 41:33.467
Shoot.

41:33.967 --> 41:35.200
For fudge sakes.

41:35.200 --> 41:38.266
- Explain that.
- Just not a lot of gold.

41:38.266 --> 41:40.834
I was hoping
for double figures.

41:44.266 --> 41:46.467
The way I understand it
and what all the old timers

41:46.467 --> 41:49.333
have told me, every time
there's a storm,

41:49.333 --> 41:52.967
it's depositing gold
and this river
is flushing it down.

41:52.967 --> 41:56.033
The river continually
is depositing gold.

41:56.033 --> 41:58.100
I believe that, Dave,
but I hate to say it,

41:58.100 --> 42:01.600
it's not financially feasible
for us to try and wait for it

42:01.600 --> 42:04.200
to deposit enough for us
to make money off of it.

42:04.200 --> 42:06.300
Really if you look at
everything that we have

42:06.300 --> 42:09.033
in front of us, you might
not be able to sell this
for 20 years, Dave.

42:11.767 --> 42:15.433
I just don't know this
is where I want to be.

42:16.700 --> 42:18.033
I really don't.

42:18.033 --> 42:22.100
I had said I'd follow Dave
to the end.

42:22.100 --> 42:24.400
Well, that could be the end.

42:24.400 --> 42:26.367
I hate to say it,
it's somewhat embarrassing.

42:26.367 --> 42:30.000
I do believe there's
virgin ground under there.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.967
I think we're going to get
a lot better gold

42:31.967 --> 42:36.834
down deeper and we're only at,
what, 12 or 15 feet?

42:36.834 --> 42:38.834
So that's what
we're going to do.

42:38.834 --> 42:42.233
I mean it's one last push,
try to prove to Jason

42:42.233 --> 42:44.834
and Nathan that
there's good gold
down deeper.

42:57.233 --> 42:59.734
You know, guys, this week's
been a little bit tough.

42:59.734 --> 43:03.600
- Oh.
- I'm kind of happy to see gold
in the bottle here.

43:03.600 --> 43:05.033
Um...

43:05.033 --> 43:07.734
I'm going to apologize
to you two, JB and Buzz,

43:07.734 --> 43:08.934
about the dozer.

43:08.934 --> 43:11.033
I'm going to leave you and JB
in charge of who uses that

43:11.033 --> 43:13.400
and when they use it
from now on, I'm not going
to have any say.

43:17.667 --> 43:19.100
Problem solved.

43:19.900 --> 43:21.400
Oh, Buzz.

43:21.400 --> 43:23.066
Obviously I still think
it was a good idea

43:23.066 --> 43:25.767
to let Brandon borrow it,
but we learned our lesson.

43:25.767 --> 43:29.166
1800 yards is all we really
ran this week because of it.

43:29.166 --> 43:30.967
It is what it is, right?

43:30.967 --> 43:32.433
You want to count
this one out?

43:32.433 --> 43:37.266
Despite all
the setbacks, Fred is just
17 ounces short

43:37.266 --> 43:40.800
of his last season total
of 110 ounces.

43:40.800 --> 43:45.867
One, three, four, five, six, seven...

43:47.433 --> 43:55.200
ten, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18.02.

43:55.200 --> 44:00.333
Worth over $30,000
bringing their season haul

44:00.333 --> 44:02.500
to 111 ounces,

44:02.500 --> 44:05.367
surpassing last year's total.

44:05.367 --> 44:08.767
If they can just keep running,
they still have a shot

44:08.767 --> 44:12.800
of hitting
their 500 ounce season goal.

44:12.800 --> 44:14.834
At this point,
we're paying the bills.

44:14.834 --> 44:18.166
We're paying back debt
and I think if we hadn't
have [bleep] up

44:18.166 --> 44:21.433
with letting our dozer go down
and had that down time,

44:21.433 --> 44:22.867
imagine how much more
we'd have.

44:22.867 --> 44:24.266
We might have beaten
our personal best.

44:24.266 --> 44:25.433
Yeah.

44:25.433 --> 44:28.433
So, keep this gold coming in.

44:43.400 --> 44:44.367
How's your week been?

44:44.367 --> 44:46.500
Nice to have two plants up
and running again.

44:46.500 --> 44:48.700
Yeah, definitely.
It's been a long time coming

44:48.700 --> 44:50.500
- getting Big Red going.
- Yeah, really.

44:50.500 --> 44:52.767
We got two of them
running again.
How good is that?

44:52.767 --> 44:53.967
Hopefully we can
keep it running.

44:53.967 --> 44:55.567
Hey, Parker.

44:55.567 --> 44:57.767
- Hey, man.
- Happy birthday.

44:57.767 --> 44:59.834
Oh, my gosh.
For me? Thanks.

45:02.400 --> 45:04.333
It's an ashtray.

45:04.333 --> 45:07.300
- Oh. Is it real gold?
- It's our gold.

45:07.300 --> 45:10.100
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

45:11.133 --> 45:13.300
Holy cow.

45:13.300 --> 45:15.500
- Oh, my gosh.
- Happy birthday.

45:15.500 --> 45:16.734
Thank you.

45:16.734 --> 45:19.834
So, everything's made
out of gold from here.

45:20.433 --> 45:22.266
A golden ashtray.

45:22.667 --> 45:24.834
Holy cow.

45:24.834 --> 45:27.767
You guys can expect something
similar in 30 years,

45:27.767 --> 45:31.000
40 years.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.066
- 695.
- Yeah.

45:33.066 --> 45:36.066
Worth $12,000.

45:36.066 --> 45:37.900
Seems like saying thank you
is not enough.

45:37.900 --> 45:40.166
You're everybody's friend
out here, you know?

45:40.166 --> 45:42.033
- Yeah.
- And we all really
appreciate that.

45:42.033 --> 45:43.734
- Thank you.
- And that's from the crew.

45:43.734 --> 45:45.000
Oh, thank you.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.200
Got Big Red set up

45:47.200 --> 45:49.867
and just got it up and going.

45:49.867 --> 45:51.834
So, Big Red didn't get
a whole lot of run time?

45:51.834 --> 45:53.166
Day and a half.

45:53.166 --> 45:54.333
Oh. Oh, yeah.

45:54.333 --> 45:56.133
- Want to see?
- Sure.

45:56.133 --> 46:00.533
Now, it's time
for the first gold
from the Runway cut.

46:04.333 --> 46:05.934
Ten. There we go.

46:05.934 --> 46:07.100
Twenty.

46:09.300 --> 46:14.166
Thirty, 40, 51.6.

46:15.033 --> 46:18.767
Worth
nearly $90,000.

46:18.767 --> 46:22.367
But if they can run
Big Red for a full week,

46:22.367 --> 46:25.233
it could deliver half
a million.

46:26.467 --> 46:29.266
And Sluicifer's been purring
right along, too.

46:29.266 --> 46:31.700
There's been no majors
on that, so...

46:31.700 --> 46:33.700
we got a good number here, T.

46:33.700 --> 46:37.533
Sluicifer has been
running dirt from
the payback cut.

46:37.533 --> 46:41.100
The last clean-up produced
210 ounces.

46:41.100 --> 46:42.600
We're ready. Let's do it.

46:42.600 --> 46:45.066
Twenty, 40...

46:46.700 --> 46:49.333
150, 200,

46:51.734 --> 46:54.433
300, 330,

46:56.166 --> 46:58.900
336.05.

46:58.900 --> 47:00.800
- It's not bad.
- Not at all.

47:01.934 --> 47:06.467
Worth
nearly $600,000.

47:06.467 --> 47:08.033
Now you get Big Red
to do that too,

47:08.033 --> 47:09.667
and we'll have some
pretty nice weeks.

47:09.667 --> 47:11.934
Well, are
you guys happy to be done
moving wash plants?

47:11.934 --> 47:13.867
- Yeah.
- It's a lot of work,
that's for sure,

47:13.867 --> 47:16.033
but you know,
to have Big Red there,

47:16.033 --> 47:18.266
and, I mean, you look at
the property lines,

47:18.266 --> 47:19.667
right there, we're at it.

47:19.667 --> 47:22.300
So now it's a matter of just
getting all that dirt through

47:22.300 --> 47:24.533
these plants,
and pretty crazy,

47:24.533 --> 47:26.634
like, you look at how many
miles of ground
we've gotten through

47:26.634 --> 47:27.767
over the years,

47:27.767 --> 47:30.333
and to be at the last
little bit of it.

47:30.333 --> 47:31.867
Sluice it or lose it.

47:31.867 --> 47:33.233
Okay. Thanks, fellas.

47:33.233 --> 47:35.333
- No problem,
see you guys later.
- Thank you.

47:35.333 --> 47:37.166
That is totally...
he hammered all of that.

47:37.166 --> 47:38.467
Don't take it to Vegas.

47:38.467 --> 47:41.600
No. Thanks, Parker.

47:41.600 --> 47:43.667
It's good to have two plants
back up and running.

47:43.667 --> 47:46.066
Um...

47:46.066 --> 47:48.266
You know, we've still got
a lot of ground
to get through,

47:48.266 --> 47:50.634
and not a lot of season left
to do it in, so...

47:50.634 --> 47:51.667
Come on.

47:53.533 --> 47:56.066
So, hopefully we can
just keep them going,

47:56.066 --> 47:58.967
but that gets more
and more difficult

47:58.967 --> 48:00.667
as the year drags on.
