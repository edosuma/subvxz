what's on "Gossip Girl."

[female #2]
Someone saw Serena getting off

00:08.660 --> 00:09.835
the train at Grand Central.

00:09.922 --> 00:10.836
I thought everything
was good between us.

00:10.923 --> 00:11.968
It was before I found out

00:12.055 --> 00:13.274
you had sex with my boyfriend.

00:13.361 --> 00:14.362
I didn't come back for you.

00:14.449 --> 00:15.798
Look, Blair's my best friend

00:15.885 --> 00:17.974
and you're her boyfriend,
and she loves you.

00:18.061 --> 00:19.367
You'd really go out with
some guy you don't know?

00:19.454 --> 00:21.195
Well, you can't be worse
than the guys I do know.

00:21.282 --> 00:23.284
This party is for you, okay,
so you can meet people

00:23.371 --> 00:24.676

[Chuck]
'Nathaniel, I'm shocked.'

00:26.069 --> 00:27.766
I thought you were strictly
an herbal man.

00:27.853 --> 00:30.465
- This isn't mine.
- Which is how I found this.

00:30.552 --> 00:32.467
[Anne]
'It isn't mine,
and it isn't your father's.'

00:32.554 --> 00:33.903
What do you have to say
for yourself, Nate?

00:33.990 --> 00:37.211
- You said you love me.
- Loved...you.

00:37.298 --> 00:38.821
[Rufus]
I'm sorry I kissed you,
but I did it

00:38.908 --> 00:41.345
because I thought he should know
how it feels to lose you.

00:41.432 --> 00:43.608
I like you, only you.

00:43.695 --> 00:47.786
That's good because
I feel the same about you.

00:47.873 --> 00:49.397
[Serena]
The masks come off at midnight,
and I kind of need my disguise.

00:49.484 --> 00:51.486
You know what?
You wanna trade?

00:51.573 --> 00:52.922
Sure.

00:53.009 --> 00:54.663
Serena, I know
we both care about Blair

00:54.750 --> 00:56.882
but maybe the best thing is for
me to just tell her the truth.

00:56.969 --> 00:58.362
I'm not over you.

00:58.449 --> 01:00.451
Oh!

01:00.538 --> 01:02.497
- Nate?
- Serena.

01:02.584 --> 01:04.064
Hey! Have you seen Nate?

01:05.326 --> 01:07.676
[Blair]
'Jenny.'

01:07.763 --> 01:10.592
[Gossip Girl]
Where's she been, Serena?
And who am I?

01:10.679 --> 01:13.029
That's a secret
I'll never tell.

01:14.117 --> 01:15.684
You know you love me.

your years of underage boozing

have finally paid off.

And you are my toughest critic.
Well, second toughest.

02:47.341 --> 02:49.821
So, do you think your father
will go for it?

02:49.908 --> 02:52.259
It is exactly the kind

You're not gonna end up
in one of these places.

right now, alright?

No, you don't understand,

for the ball

You know, round,
silverish, sparkly?

Yeah, I think I saw that next

told them anything yet.

I be telling them

- Your mother.

I'll take one for the team.

05:22.713 --> 05:25.847
Ooh! Yeah, this is definitely
not very comfortable.

05:25.934 --> 05:27.588
I know, you'd think all
the money that we spent

05:27.675 --> 05:29.067
on this private school,
they could at least

05:29.154 --> 05:30.895
give us a comfortable
spot to make out.

05:30.982 --> 05:34.812
Or a better chemistry teacher.

a place more private.

for eventually.

it's not like this sucks.

talk about this though.

About us,
about eventually.

06:27.691 --> 06:30.346
Definitely. Yes. Yes.

over with in a broom closet.

mean anything I said about

07:05.120 --> 07:06.077

07:06.164 --> 07:08.819
Maybe you didn't. I just..

I mean, I don't even care,
but other people might.

07:13.650 --> 07:16.784
- Yeah, I know.
- Yeah, including my brother.

07:19.656 --> 07:21.963

being friends with Blair.

to help me out here.

Uh, promise to help me
come up with a more

collection, but thank you.

this at the ball.

anything. You know that.

Friends don't lie,
and we're friends, right?

Right.

to the penthouse

08:22.806 --> 08:24.155

earlier were excellent

anything to Serena.

anything to anyone.

to play out in a certain way.

What's with the business formal?

to your company.

09:43.234 --> 09:45.715
'Something avant-garde,
yet nostalgic.'

09:45.802 --> 09:48.849

09:57.858 --> 10:00.251
- You are?
- Are you kidding me?

10:00.338 --> 10:01.775
Do you know how long
I've been waiting for you to be

10:01.862 --> 10:02.950
interested in something
other than partying?

10:03.037 --> 10:04.342
[chuckles]

10:08.172 --> 10:12.307
You should come see the place.
It sells itself.

10:12.394 --> 10:17.094
Um...I have some meetings,
but, uh, how's after--

10:17.181 --> 10:19.096
A-after's, after's great.

10:20.271 --> 10:21.882
After's good.

10:21.969 --> 10:24.319
So...I heard on "Gossip Girl"

10:24.406 --> 10:27.235
that you were having
sex with Dan out here..

10:27.322 --> 10:28.540
...in streaming video.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.108
Oh, God!
Kati and Iz filmed us?

10:31.195 --> 10:33.937
Oh, it's all very, "High School
Musical" scandalous.

10:34.024 --> 10:37.462
And no, they haven't
streamed it yet, but..

10:39.334 --> 10:42.163
...I heard it was...aggressive.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.165
I must say, Dan has been
surprisingly good

10:44.252 --> 10:45.340
at everything we've done.

10:45.427 --> 10:47.734
- Which is...everything?
- No!

10:47.821 --> 10:50.737
[chuckles]
But feel free to ask
any personal questions.

10:50.824 --> 10:52.173
But you've talked about it,
right?

10:52.260 --> 10:54.088
No, mom,we haven't.

10:54.175 --> 10:57.265
May I remind you that this is
your first real boyfriend, S.

10:57.352 --> 10:59.136
And in relationships,
you talk about stuff.

10:59.223 --> 11:02.662
I know, but I don't know,
sometimes talking about it

11:02.749 --> 11:06.143
or planning it can ruin
a good thing, you know?

11:06.230 --> 11:07.536
I would know.

11:09.407 --> 11:11.409
Well, as long as
you're not worried.

11:11.496 --> 11:13.237
Well, I'm not, but..

11:13.324 --> 11:15.283
I don't know, he might be.

11:15.370 --> 11:17.720
Is it possible for a guy
to want to slow things down?

11:17.807 --> 11:18.982
Only the guys we like.

11:19.069 --> 11:21.332
[both laughing]

11:21.419 --> 11:23.552
But...with you..

11:24.509 --> 11:26.163
...I can't imagine why.

11:28.818 --> 11:31.212
[breathing heavily]

11:34.737 --> 11:36.217
How was I?

11:36.304 --> 11:38.785
I don't know.
Let's ask the judges.

11:38.872 --> 11:40.569
Hmm.

11:40.656 --> 11:42.571
I was gonna give you a three,
but since you're a virgin

11:42.658 --> 11:44.138
I gave you an extra point.

11:44.225 --> 11:46.140
Hey, I chose to wait.

11:46.227 --> 11:50.187
Sex is meaningful, like art,
and you don't rush art.

11:50.274 --> 11:52.842
Who's Art?
Did you sleep with him?

11:54.235 --> 11:55.889
[Rufus' voice]
Did you sleep with him?

11:55.976 --> 11:58.239
[Rufus]
Did you or did you
not sleep with him?

11:58.326 --> 12:00.415
Yes, Alison, I did encourage you
to do your paintings

12:00.502 --> 12:01.808
not the next door neighbor.

12:03.984 --> 12:05.768
Hello. Hello.

12:07.335 --> 12:08.553
[sighs]

12:10.425 --> 12:12.340
Uh, Dan, I-I didn't realize
you were home.

12:12.427 --> 12:14.168
I'm sorry
you had to hear that.

12:14.255 --> 12:16.910
Well, I did. Something about,
uh, uh, mom and a neighbor?

12:16.997 --> 12:19.869
Yeah, it's...complicated.

12:19.956 --> 12:22.176
Mom's having an affair.
It's easy when you just say it.

12:22.263 --> 12:23.612
Not to your son.

12:23.699 --> 12:25.353
Well, she hasn't exactly
been rushing back to us.

12:25.440 --> 12:26.833
It's good to know why.

12:28.269 --> 12:31.315
I'm home.
What's going on, dad?

12:31.402 --> 12:33.709
Uh, nothing.
I just gotta get some groceries.

12:38.322 --> 12:39.584
- Dan?
- Uh, I'm sorry, Jen.

12:39.671 --> 12:40.977
I got a lot of homework.

12:45.808 --> 12:47.723
Hey, dad,
I'm, like, ten blocks away.

12:47.810 --> 12:50.247
[Howard]
'What? Oh, sorry, Nate.'

12:50.334 --> 12:53.555
'I have to take
a rain check on our drink.'

12:53.642 --> 12:55.122
- Why?
- 'Client in crisis.'

12:55.209 --> 12:56.471
'Can't get out of the office'

12:56.558 --> 12:59.343
'but I'll be home
as soon as I can.'

12:59.430 --> 13:00.867
Well, dad, our talk
was kind of important.

13:00.954 --> 13:03.260
'It's business, Nate.
You understand, right?'

13:03.347 --> 13:04.871
'We'll talk later.'

13:08.483 --> 13:10.137
Looks like parents
can be deceiving

13:10.224 --> 13:12.052
on both sides of the bridge.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.144
[upbeat music]

13:27.545 --> 13:30.897
You are...really talented.

13:35.336 --> 13:37.294
Dad, uh..

13:40.080 --> 13:42.604
I, uh, ahem,
I didn't think you'd make it.

13:42.691 --> 13:45.563
And you want me to pour hundreds
of thousands of dollars

13:45.650 --> 13:47.870
into an excuse for you
to be around booze and women?

13:47.957 --> 13:50.133
No. No, I..

13:50.220 --> 13:52.353
Did you read the proposal?
It shows a much bigger picture.

13:52.440 --> 13:55.747
I came down here because
I saw the effort you made.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.880
'You want to impress me with
your commitment to something?'

13:57.967 --> 14:02.450
Try getting a few A's in school
or maybe a part-time job.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.060
[instrumental music]

14:11.938 --> 14:14.114
- Bye.
- Hey.

14:15.376 --> 14:16.768
Let's go get some lunch.

14:18.727 --> 14:20.903
Looks like the pot
calling the kettle black

14:20.990 --> 14:22.949
has young Bass boiling over.

14:23.036 --> 14:26.822
And if we know Chuck,
he's not one to let things lie.

14:26.909 --> 14:29.346
Someone pour that man a drink.

14:29.433 --> 14:30.652
You need to look elegant

14:30.739 --> 14:32.393
for the Archibald dinner
tomorrow night.

14:32.480 --> 14:33.655
So what do you think?

14:33.742 --> 14:35.135
Yes, it would be very nice

14:35.222 --> 14:37.398
if I was sailing up
on the Mayflower.

14:38.573 --> 14:41.445
Anne Archibald was wearing

14:41.532 --> 14:45.623
her amazing Cornelius Vanderbilt
diamond ring the other night.

14:45.710 --> 14:48.104
She was going on and on

14:48.191 --> 14:52.892
about how it would end up
on your finger...someday.

14:52.979 --> 14:56.896
Wait. Nate spoke to his
mother about our future?

14:56.983 --> 15:00.029
He actually asked
for the family ring?

15:00.116 --> 15:01.465
Mm-hmm.

15:04.860 --> 15:07.254
[indistinct chattering]

15:08.646 --> 15:10.431
[instrumental music]

15:26.621 --> 15:30.320
Looks like cold, hard cash can
get you the cold, hard truth.

15:30.407 --> 15:33.976
Didn't anyone tell you, Anne?
Be careful what you fish for.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.938
[instrumental music]

15:43.116 --> 15:45.379
I can't believe we actually
got the apartment to ourselves.

15:45.466 --> 15:46.946
You got downtown pretty fast.

15:47.033 --> 15:48.469
Well, with an opportunity
like this

15:48.556 --> 15:51.037
one needs
to take advantage.

15:51.124 --> 15:53.039
[chuckles]

15:58.870 --> 16:00.350
How long do you think till your
dad and sister will be back?

16:00.437 --> 16:04.441
Uh, anywhere from
an hour to 20 minutes?

16:04.528 --> 16:07.183
Well, 20 minutes is plenty.

16:10.099 --> 16:11.883
[sighs]

16:11.971 --> 16:13.450
[chuckles]

16:13.537 --> 16:16.323
It's kind of bright in here,
don't you think?

16:16.410 --> 16:19.630
I'll, maybe get some blinds
or a...a clapper.

16:19.717 --> 16:21.545
Mm, how about next time?

16:28.422 --> 16:30.380
[Vanessa]
'Hey, Dan. Hungry?'

16:30.467 --> 16:32.034
Hello.

16:32.121 --> 16:34.950
- Hi.
- Hi! Vanessa, right?

16:35.037 --> 16:37.257
- Good to see you!
- Good to see you.

16:37.344 --> 16:42.349
And good to see you
seeing us...seeing you.

16:42.436 --> 16:43.611
'Excuse me.'

16:45.961 --> 16:47.397
You really need
to start using that door.

16:47.484 --> 16:48.746
Which you're showing me to.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.139
Well, practice
will make you perfect.

16:50.226 --> 16:52.185
Leaving, out the door.

16:52.272 --> 16:54.665
And we appreciate it.

17:02.325 --> 17:03.892
[instrumental music]

17:06.677 --> 17:08.027
[Dan]
'Sorry.'

17:10.942 --> 17:13.075
So do you think
we should talk about it?

17:14.468 --> 17:16.731
Oh, you mean
about-about Vanessa?

17:16.818 --> 17:18.863
No, you know what? She's like
family. It feels comfortable.

17:18.950 --> 17:21.605
And so, therefore, she often
shows up without calling.

17:21.692 --> 17:26.958
No, I-I mean about what almost,
maybe might have just happened.

17:27.046 --> 17:31.441
Oh, you mean if Vanessa
hadn't entered and we--

17:31.528 --> 17:33.313
Or we could not talk about it.

17:37.012 --> 17:38.492
[Rufus]
'Dan, we're home.'

17:40.276 --> 17:42.235
'We got breakfast.'

17:42.322 --> 17:43.453
Hungry?

17:46.021 --> 17:48.980
Spotted,
Bass drunk off his ass.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.635
At The Palace bar
drinking away his woes

17:51.722 --> 17:53.289
and his investment capital.

17:53.376 --> 17:55.639
Nathaniel,
your position in my esteem

17:55.726 --> 17:58.860
has been replaced
by your voice mail.

17:58.947 --> 18:02.081
So, Bart didn't go for Victrola.

18:02.168 --> 18:05.475
But truth is I bought the house
out already for tonight

18:05.562 --> 18:09.000
and it's not a party
without my people.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.046
Or any people.

18:11.133 --> 18:12.656
[Chuck sighs]
'I'll see you there.'

18:17.008 --> 18:18.314
[grunts]

18:20.447 --> 18:21.970
[sighs]

18:22.840 --> 18:24.451
[clears throat]

18:24.538 --> 18:28.019
- Long night?
- Alfonso made me an omelet.

18:28.107 --> 18:31.762
And I may have washed it down
with a bellini or two.

18:31.849 --> 18:34.200
Your father didn't go
for your business proposal.

18:37.942 --> 18:43.209
- Come on. Let me help you.
- He was born poor.

18:43.296 --> 18:44.993
- I was born loaded.
- Yeah.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.604
But if the only way
to impress him

18:47.691 --> 18:49.824
is if I started
with nothing

18:49.911 --> 18:52.914
then why doesn't
he just take it all away?

18:54.089 --> 18:55.438
[groaning]

18:55.525 --> 18:57.614
Because he loves you.

18:57.701 --> 19:01.009
No good parent likes
to see his child go without.

19:01.096 --> 19:03.490
I had the idea.
I did the work.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.450
He tells me
I can't be committed

19:07.537 --> 19:10.453
and he's the one screwing
25 year olds..

19:10.540 --> 19:12.412
...when he's supposedly
committed to you.

19:12.499 --> 19:17.460
We're newly committed,
as recent as last week.

19:17.547 --> 19:19.245
I wonder why he was pawing
some Asian chick

19:19.332 --> 19:21.943
in his limo yesterday.

19:24.772 --> 19:27.340
How could I be surprised,
really?

19:29.429 --> 19:30.952
Excuse me.

19:34.825 --> 19:36.392
[chuckles]
I'm on my way.

19:42.355 --> 19:43.878
Uh, I'm late
for my blowout at Arden's.

19:43.965 --> 19:48.839
Mom, please.
The drugs were dad's.

19:48.926 --> 19:50.711
I mean, I guess he thought
it'd be easier on everyone

19:50.798 --> 19:52.669
if I took the hit.

19:52.756 --> 19:54.584
But they were his.

19:54.671 --> 19:56.412
- I don't understand.
- No.

19:56.499 --> 19:59.459
He promised he'd flush the coke.
Then I caught him buying more.

19:59.546 --> 20:01.330
The lengths that you will go to
to get out of trouble--

20:01.417 --> 20:03.811
Mom, he has a problem.

20:03.898 --> 20:05.943
I need your help, please.

20:08.119 --> 20:09.686
You look down
at the floor every time

20:09.773 --> 20:11.862
someone tries to tell you
the truth.

20:11.949 --> 20:14.256
Just look at me. Mom!

20:16.084 --> 20:19.522
I saw dad
buying drugs yesterday.

20:19.609 --> 20:21.220
He's been under
a lot of pressure.

20:23.178 --> 20:26.007
- If you'd not been difficult.
- What?

20:26.094 --> 20:27.617
Your latest rebellions
have been very hard

20:27.704 --> 20:29.402
on your father, Nate.

20:29.489 --> 20:31.534
All this business
with Dartmouth.

20:31.621 --> 20:33.841
- Your issues with Blair--
- Mom, dad needs your help.

20:33.928 --> 20:36.147
Not another word of this.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.889
We have a celebratory dinner
to get to.

20:38.976 --> 20:40.543
Please wear a tie.

20:45.809 --> 20:47.942
[moaning on laptop]

20:51.206 --> 20:52.425
[door opens]

20:52.512 --> 20:54.644
[Dan]
'See..'

20:54.731 --> 20:56.603
...you curl your fingers
into a fist

20:56.690 --> 20:58.996
and with several thrust
of force, you..

20:59.083 --> 21:01.216
...knock on the door.

21:01.303 --> 21:03.784
Hey, I didn't use
the fire escape.

21:03.871 --> 21:05.481
Baby steps.

21:05.568 --> 21:08.789
And what are you doing
watching porn?

21:10.225 --> 21:12.183
It's not porn.
It's art cinema.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.924
Oh, from what I saw earlier

21:14.011 --> 21:15.535
you don't need to be
doing research.

21:15.622 --> 21:17.580
I can't talk
about this with you.

21:17.667 --> 21:19.713
I'm curious though..

21:19.800 --> 21:21.149
...about the change
in your attitude

21:21.236 --> 21:22.977
because may I remind you

21:23.064 --> 21:25.414
that in your pale,
romantic, tortured days

21:25.501 --> 21:27.634
you'd wax on,
and I quote that

21:27.721 --> 21:31.942
"Sex is meaningful, like art,
and you don't rush art."

21:32.029 --> 21:33.988
That was in, uh, 2005.

21:34.075 --> 21:37.774
I was more idealistic then.
I was much younger.

21:37.861 --> 21:41.865
And there wasn't an actual girl
who wanted to have sex with me.

21:41.952 --> 21:45.260
You're...going to lose
your virginity.

21:45.347 --> 21:48.568
- Ooh, can you--
- My friend, Dan.

21:48.655 --> 21:52.354
Please not turn my sex life
into a country song?

21:52.441 --> 21:55.096
It's okay. I'm sure
Serena knows what to do.

21:55.183 --> 21:56.793
What with her
vast experiences

21:56.880 --> 22:00.841
with boarding school professors,
Pamplonian bullfighters

22:00.928 --> 22:02.669
best friends' boyfriends--

22:02.756 --> 22:05.236
That's enough now.
You can go. Please.

22:11.242 --> 22:14.333
But if it were me with you..

22:15.725 --> 22:18.859
...I'd want you to hide Cedric.

22:18.946 --> 22:21.644
Maybe get some candles..

22:21.731 --> 22:23.080
...and replace
the football sheets.

22:24.734 --> 22:29.783
- But...take it or leave it.
- Thanks.

22:29.870 --> 22:32.263
[instrumental music]

22:34.918 --> 22:36.790
[Jenny]
Thanks for helping me out
with the bracelet.

22:36.877 --> 22:38.618
I didn't know a broken clasp
could cost that much.

22:38.705 --> 22:42.448
Oh, it was my pleasure.
Oh, wait. No, it wasn't.

22:42.535 --> 22:44.798
Game recognizes game,
little J

22:44.885 --> 22:46.234
but you have to show
more respect.

22:46.321 --> 22:47.670
This is the last time
I've helped you.

22:47.757 --> 22:51.021
Next time you cross me,
I won't be as forgiving.

22:51.108 --> 22:52.893
Don't worry.
There won't be a next time.

22:52.980 --> 22:55.591
Good, because I wanna tell you
something.

22:55.678 --> 22:58.420
Something nobody knows,
not even Serena.

22:58.507 --> 23:01.249
- You can keep a secret, right?
- Of course.

23:01.336 --> 23:05.079
Nate is planning on giving me
his family diamond.

23:05.166 --> 23:08.778
It's the most incredible ring
you've ever seen.

23:08.865 --> 23:11.868
Uh, ring as in engagement ring?

I remember the first time
I ever saw him.

23:16.612 --> 23:20.311
Maybe we were just
little kids, but I knew..

23:20.399 --> 23:23.532
...he's the one I wanna marry.

23:23.619 --> 23:25.839
Now, it seems like
he feels the same way too.

23:29.146 --> 23:31.148
Why are you not happy for me?

23:31.235 --> 23:33.194
I'm sorry.

23:33.281 --> 23:35.501
It's-it's just been
a really weird week.

Um, there's this stuff
with my parents and my family

23:39.287 --> 23:41.245
'so, maybe I should just go.'

23:41.332 --> 23:43.117
No, maybe you should
look at me in the eye

23:43.204 --> 23:45.728
and tell me what you're hiding.

23:45.815 --> 23:47.687
- Are you jealous?
- Of you and Nate?

23:47.774 --> 23:49.776
- Do you like him?
- What? No.

23:49.863 --> 23:51.778
Do you think because you
talked to him once in the hall

23:51.865 --> 23:54.041
that you might have a shot?

23:54.128 --> 23:58.567
- Blair, it's nothing like that.
- Then tell me what is it like?

23:58.654 --> 24:01.744
- I don't want to hurt you.
- How could you hurt me?

24:03.572 --> 24:06.096
Yesterday wasn't the first time
I talked to Nate.

24:06.183 --> 24:09.360
At the ball, he told me
he wasn't over Serena.

24:09.448 --> 24:10.884
Why would he tell you that?

24:10.971 --> 24:13.060
Because I was wearing her mask.

24:14.627 --> 24:16.672
And he thought I was her.

24:21.068 --> 24:24.854
- He kissed me.
- That's enough.

24:24.941 --> 24:27.727
Blair, I-I didn't want you
to find out--

just chill here.

the right thing.

You did.
Now, Blair knows the truth.

27:31.780 --> 27:32.868
And she and Nate
can talk about it.

27:32.955 --> 27:34.391
Honest communication

27:34.478 --> 27:36.350

can we be talking about?
