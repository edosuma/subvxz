WEBVTT

00:06.540 --> 00:08.209
Holy crap.

00:08.242 --> 00:10.844
You still working that,
uh, accident?

00:10.878 --> 00:13.347
Got nothing so far.
I've heard about
this missing drug shipment.

00:13.381 --> 00:15.816
If I were you,
I would, uh, poke around.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.152
I'm here to
report a crime.
Sign in.

00:24.225 --> 00:26.494
Bridger found out we can't
go to the cops. That's
where we're at right now.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.429
I brought you all
$2,000 each, to make us even.

00:28.462 --> 00:30.231
What about the drugs?

00:30.264 --> 00:32.166
There's this guy
that I work with,

00:32.200 --> 00:33.567
and he can help us
and we wouldn't even
have to do anything.

00:33.601 --> 00:35.536
I just wanted you to see
what you have to work for.

00:35.569 --> 00:36.604
Scarlet!

00:40.408 --> 00:42.410
We're gonna need
Big Sam's address.

00:42.443 --> 00:43.344
His girl doesn't know anything
about this.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.279
But Tonya's a good girl.

00:45.313 --> 00:47.748
What can I get you?
We'd love to ask you
some questions

00:47.781 --> 00:49.450
about Sam Teske.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.219
His name's Sam Teske.

00:51.252 --> 00:53.387
Just a weird coincidence.
I'm looking for the same guy.

00:53.421 --> 00:55.189
His girlfriend hired me
to find him.

00:55.223 --> 00:56.190
Well,
let's go talk to her.

00:56.224 --> 00:57.558
Tonya?

01:02.663 --> 01:03.797
She's gone.

01:15.243 --> 01:17.211
Does that hurt?

01:17.245 --> 01:18.279
Oh.

01:24.152 --> 01:25.619
Boom.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.455
Gentle pressure.
Go ahead.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.923
You can do it.
Go ahead.

01:29.957 --> 01:31.091
Does that feel better?

01:33.461 --> 01:34.495
Yeah.

01:41.969 --> 01:43.504
Now I need to know
where your boyfriend

01:43.537 --> 01:44.938
hid my drugs and money.

01:44.972 --> 01:47.074
I told you,
I don't know where it is.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.743
Well, I believe you, but that
doesn't matter to my boss.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.845
You know what happens
when I don't do my job?

01:51.879 --> 01:54.848
My boss sends some freak
like Donno here to kill me.

01:56.217 --> 01:57.985
Can you
put the lip gloss down?

01:59.553 --> 02:01.955
Yeah, he likes shiny things,
don't you, Donno?

02:06.194 --> 02:07.395
You got a boss,
don't you?

02:09.563 --> 02:12.633
Gary.
Okay, when he asks you
to do stuff, you do it, yeah?

02:12.666 --> 02:14.502
Yes.
Yeah, 'cause
you're a good employee

02:14.535 --> 02:18.506
and you value your work
and you take pride in your job.

02:18.539 --> 02:19.807
I'm just a waitress.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.176
Don't do that.

02:22.210 --> 02:24.278
Don't diminish your worth.
We're women.

02:24.312 --> 02:26.814
We got enough people out there
doing that to us every day.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.316
You're good at your job, Tonya.
I remember.

02:28.349 --> 02:30.718
You were efficient.
You're friendly. Remember?

02:30.751 --> 02:32.353
I never got my coleslaw.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.355
Okay, ignore him.
You're good at your job.

02:34.388 --> 02:38.192
And a little birdie
in the Sheriff's Department,

02:38.226 --> 02:40.461
he told me you were
a good girl, too.

02:40.494 --> 02:43.664
His exact words.
It was cute.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.802
What, are you surprised that we
have the police on the payroll?

02:48.836 --> 02:50.238
Come on.
Of course we do.

02:50.271 --> 02:51.639
I didn't take your money.
Please.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.707
Yeah, but Sam did,
and now you're responsible.

02:53.741 --> 02:55.075
I don't know where it is.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.044
Well, who
was he working with?

02:57.077 --> 03:00.047
Maybe he had a little
job buddy, a little helper.

03:01.582 --> 03:02.950
Unless that's you,
Tonya.

03:04.718 --> 03:06.254
I don't know
what you're talking about.

03:06.287 --> 03:07.588
Didn't he tell you
anything?

03:07.621 --> 03:09.022
No.

03:09.056 --> 03:12.560
I mean, yes...and no.
I didn't ask.

03:12.593 --> 03:15.162
Sam doesn't like questions
about important stuff.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.064
It stresses him out.
"Stressed."

03:17.097 --> 03:19.833
He's dead.
Sorry, that's the truth.

03:19.867 --> 03:23.337
What?
Now you need to
be honest with me, okay?

03:23.371 --> 03:24.772
Otherwise,
I got to get Donno here

03:24.805 --> 03:26.440
to do what he does best.

03:26.474 --> 03:28.175
I don't want to watch
that happen, Tonya.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.544
Hey.
What?

03:38.652 --> 03:40.053
What is this?

03:42.222 --> 03:45.225
I hired a private investigator
to find Sam.

03:58.806 --> 04:01.074
So this Tonya's
your client.

04:01.108 --> 04:03.110
And Sam Teske's
girlfriend.

04:03.143 --> 04:05.112
She hired me to find him
after he didn't come home.

04:05.145 --> 04:06.113
And now she's missing,
too?

04:06.146 --> 04:07.581
Not missing. Abducted.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.650
Her place was ransacked
when we arrived.

04:09.683 --> 04:12.119
All this started out
as a simple car accident,

04:12.152 --> 04:14.322
and now you two are
back together again.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.290
Last time that happened,
I ended up getting shot.

04:16.324 --> 04:17.758
You don't need
to remind me.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.327
Oh, I thought I might.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.161
None of this is
helping us find Tonya.

04:21.194 --> 04:23.230
We think she was mixed up in
whatever Big Sam was doing.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.999
Yeah, about that. First, you two
need to talk to State.

04:26.033 --> 04:29.570
I got a call. Apparently
this Big Sam was on their radar.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.138
They have some undercover
investigation going on.

04:31.171 --> 04:32.606
They want
to compare notes.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.008
You mean stop us
from doing anything?

04:35.042 --> 04:38.512
Wait, my client
is the priority.

04:38.546 --> 04:39.847
This is a missing woman
we're talking about.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.115
I am not asking.

04:42.149 --> 04:43.984
You two need to talk
to their guy on the ground

04:44.017 --> 04:45.453
or they will shut us down.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.154
You can meet him
at that location.

04:57.898 --> 05:01.369
So the accident, it is related
to the case I've been working.

05:01.402 --> 05:04.872
Sam Teske -- Big Sam --
he works for a local outfit,

05:04.905 --> 05:07.274
but they got connections
to the Bhullar cartel.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.877
And now, he's always just been
a low-level courier,

05:09.910 --> 05:12.212
but what I'm hearing is he made
a play for that drug drop.

05:12.245 --> 05:14.181
And we know how that went.

05:14.214 --> 05:16.049
His girlfriend, Tonya,
is now also missing.

05:16.083 --> 05:18.352
What can you tell us
about that?
Not much.

05:18.386 --> 05:20.053
We have no reason to believe
she was involved

05:20.087 --> 05:21.722
with anything
he was doing.

05:21.755 --> 05:22.890
Involved or not,
she's missing.

05:22.923 --> 05:25.693
She's not a priority.

05:25.726 --> 05:28.662
Y-Y'all know I'm after
bigger fish than Sam Teske.

05:28.696 --> 05:31.965
So we don't respond well
to being asked to stand down.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.034
I don't know if that's where
you were headed, so...

05:34.067 --> 05:36.336
Oh, yeah? Who's "we"?
Hmm?

05:36.370 --> 05:37.838
'Cause I thought
you told me

05:37.871 --> 05:39.039
Deputy Poppernak
was your partner.

05:39.072 --> 05:41.375
I'm sorry. Poppernak...

05:41.409 --> 05:43.043
D-Do you two know each other,
or...?

05:46.447 --> 05:48.816
Travis and I go way back
when I was working undercover.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.484
That's right.

05:50.518 --> 05:53.020
Look, there's no reason why
we can't help each other.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.656
We know that Tonya's place
was searched,

05:55.689 --> 05:57.825
which means whoever was there
was looking for something.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.394
Great. If you guys hear
anything, just let me know.

06:00.428 --> 06:02.095
As long as it's
a two-way street.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.331
Absolutely.

06:04.364 --> 06:07.334
Yeah, if I hear anything,
I will -- I will pass it down,

06:07.367 --> 06:08.902
but I'm not gonna
compromise my cover

06:08.936 --> 06:10.270
for something like this.

06:10.303 --> 06:12.440
Your cover versus
a woman's life?

06:13.974 --> 06:15.743
Got it.
Listen,

06:15.776 --> 06:18.512
Sam Teske was mixed up
with some real bad people.

06:18.546 --> 06:22.015
I-I really hope
your client is okay.

06:25.719 --> 06:26.720
It's nice to meet you,
Cassie.

06:26.754 --> 06:27.455
Mm.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.194
You know, this whole time
I was wondering

06:34.227 --> 06:36.764
why he looked so familiar,
and, um...

06:36.797 --> 06:38.632
he was at the bar
the other night.

06:38.666 --> 06:41.034
I-I didn't notice.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.269
You really gonna
make me ask?

06:42.302 --> 06:44.137
Yeah? Ask -- Ask what?

06:44.171 --> 06:45.473
Is Mr. Undercover
good under the covers?

06:45.506 --> 06:46.974
I don't know what
you're talking about.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.876
Mm-hmm.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.143
Alright,
I'll let this one slide.

06:51.445 --> 06:53.914
What are we supposed to do
after that conversation?

06:53.947 --> 06:55.983
Simple.
We find Tonya.

07:03.657 --> 07:07.595
Hey, Mads.
Check this out.
Oh, no.

07:07.628 --> 07:10.430
Please tell me you didn't spend
your $2,000 on a drone.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.165
Nope.
Something so much better.

07:13.601 --> 07:15.402
What is that?
A police scanner.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.838
Okay, why did you buy
a police scanner?

07:17.871 --> 07:19.807
To keep tabs on things.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.108
I mean, maybe I can hear some
chatter about what happened.

07:21.141 --> 07:22.810
Hopefully there's no chatter.

07:22.843 --> 07:25.979
Yeah, but if there is,
we'll know about it.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.414
What are you gonna spend
your $2,000 on?

07:27.447 --> 07:28.949
Definitely not on
a police scanner.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.018
Mm-hmm.
So you're not gonna tell me?

07:31.051 --> 07:34.087
I don't know. I might just save
it...or invest it.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.288
I haven't made up
my mind yet.

07:35.322 --> 07:36.323
You can always
give it to me.

07:36.356 --> 07:38.526
Leave my room now, please.

07:46.767 --> 07:49.503
Hey! What are you doing?
Stop it!

07:51.171 --> 07:53.774
Where are they?
Where's what?

07:58.478 --> 07:59.680
Just tell me
where you got it.

07:59.713 --> 08:01.114
I found it.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.150
Hmm.

08:03.183 --> 08:06.486
What about the money?
Hmm?

08:06.520 --> 08:08.956
Your mom told me how much
it cost to get her tooth fixed.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.023
Babysitting.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.659
Yeah.

08:11.692 --> 08:14.461
Hmm. Right.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.395
Listen...

08:17.531 --> 08:19.232
I'm gonna be
watching you.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.500
Are you gonna
tell my mom?

08:20.534 --> 08:22.169
I don't know.

08:22.202 --> 08:25.072
Depends on...
what else I find.

08:26.406 --> 08:27.875
You know what?

08:27.908 --> 08:32.012
You want to snoop in my room?
Go ahead.

08:32.045 --> 08:34.081
Just put
everything back.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.082
Creep.

08:46.727 --> 08:47.795
I need the bathroom.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.465
I need the bathroom.

08:57.805 --> 08:58.906
No! J--

09:05.746 --> 09:07.247
Hey,
I am not kidding.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.916
I am in
serious pain here.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.355
Insensible.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.057
Six letters.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.792
Third letter, T.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.431
Obtuse.

09:36.276 --> 09:37.110
Okay.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.281
You earned yourself
a bathroom break.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.394
Hurry up, Tonya.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.013
Ugh.

10:14.514 --> 10:15.849
Aah!

10:18.351 --> 10:19.753
Aah!

10:38.906 --> 10:40.974
Scarlet is
such a lovely girl.

10:42.342 --> 10:45.178
She's settling in
quite well.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.148
Ronald is not.

10:48.181 --> 10:50.150
He's testing.

10:50.183 --> 10:51.952
Always testing,

10:51.985 --> 10:54.454
I see him working
every angle.

10:54.487 --> 10:57.157
One tries and tries,

10:57.190 --> 10:59.092
but at
a certain point...

11:01.695 --> 11:03.831
We are nowhere near
that point.

11:03.864 --> 11:06.800
Ronald has shown
no improvement at all.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.201
Then change
what you're doing.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.408
Show him
the face of a friend.

11:15.442 --> 11:16.844
But...

11:22.950 --> 11:24.217
No.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.820
No, no, no. No.

11:26.854 --> 11:29.222
All you are to Ronald
is his captor.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.760
He needs to see you
in a different way.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.161
Agatha...

11:36.529 --> 11:40.100
I -- I can't look at that face
in the mirror.

11:40.133 --> 11:43.170
I -- I ca-- I can't.

11:43.203 --> 11:46.173
Oh, my love.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.440
I understand.

11:47.474 --> 11:50.177
Rick was a very bad man,

11:50.210 --> 11:52.412
but shouldn't we try
everything we can

11:52.445 --> 11:54.381
before putting an animal down?

12:12.399 --> 12:14.401
♪ I'm going the hard way

12:14.434 --> 12:16.636
Alright, charmed my way into an
early break, 'cause I'm awesome.

12:16.669 --> 12:18.271
Hey, thanks for standing me up,
by the way.

12:18.305 --> 12:19.807
You made me look like
a total asshole.

12:19.840 --> 12:23.610
Harp, we have
a bigger problem right now.

12:23.643 --> 12:24.912
T-Lock found me with
the drugs.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.814
What?
No, not all of them.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.481
Just the sample that

No. I mean, I only knew Rick
through my cousin Sally,

And body number two?

22:30.517 --> 22:32.251
Male, no ID.

22:32.284 --> 22:34.020
Couple of fly fishermen
found them.

22:34.053 --> 22:36.155
Must have drifted down
from deeper water.

22:38.925 --> 22:40.059

a lot of trouble

22:40.092 --> 22:41.193

these bodies.

22:41.227 --> 22:43.329

23:25.505 --> 23:26.806
No? Hmm.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.908
Not really.
Okay.

23:28.941 --> 23:32.679

I was really into horror.

25:25.124 --> 25:27.694
She's working with
your department.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.328
I can handle
Cassie Dewell.

25:29.361 --> 25:32.531
Maybe she knows something
about the drugs and money.

25:32.565 --> 25:33.866
Find out.

25:38.304 --> 25:39.405
I heard Tonya's missing.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.408
Is there anything
you need to tell me?

25:42.441 --> 25:43.943
Drugs and money.

25:43.976 --> 25:45.712
That's all I care about.

25:45.745 --> 25:47.279
That's all
my boss cares about.

25:47.313 --> 25:49.415
You mean Daddy?

25:49.448 --> 25:51.083
Sure do.

25:52.719 --> 25:55.788
You've got one day.
Find my stuff.

25:55.822 --> 25:57.423
Clock's tickin'.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.561
What's going on with you?

26:02.595 --> 26:04.563
He's got you wrapped
around his little finger.

26:04.597 --> 26:06.198
Keep quiet.

26:06.232 --> 26:08.234
There's eyes
and ears everywhere.

26:08.267 --> 26:09.401
We have to
get out of here.

26:09.435 --> 26:11.738
No, that's what
he wants you to do.

26:11.771 --> 26:13.439
That's what
<i>I</i> want to do.

26:17.109 --> 26:19.746
Scarlet, we were free.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.080
Don't you want that again?

26:21.113 --> 26:22.581
No, we were never free.

26:22.615 --> 26:24.550
We were always running
from something,

26:24.583 --> 26:28.921
but we couldn't run forever,
and here, we're protected.

26:28.955 --> 26:30.156
From what?

26:30.189 --> 26:32.058
The men
you were working with.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.125
What men?

26:35.161 --> 26:37.664
Wolf told me more about what
you were doing with his brother.

26:37.697 --> 26:39.666
You're going to believe
a dog trainer over me?

26:39.699 --> 26:41.133
Wolf can save us.

26:42.434 --> 26:43.435
I don't need saving.

26:46.338 --> 26:49.175
Stop it.

26:49.208 --> 26:51.911
Don't make this
any harder for me.

26:51.944 --> 26:55.481
The sooner you give in,
the easier this will be.

26:55.514 --> 26:57.516
For you.

26:57.549 --> 26:59.686
For us.

26:59.719 --> 27:01.187
What about us?

27:04.056 --> 27:06.693
I'm not going to break,
Scarlet.

27:06.726 --> 27:08.327
We're a family.

27:08.360 --> 27:09.862
It is my job
to protect you,

27:09.896 --> 27:12.131
and I will do that
by any means necessary.

27:12.164 --> 27:13.599
What if
they can fix us?

27:13.632 --> 27:15.601
Fix us?

27:15.634 --> 27:17.837
The man kidnapped me.
He tossed me in a box.

27:17.870 --> 27:19.672
He pokes me with a stick
and talks to me

27:19.706 --> 27:21.207
like I'm a little dog
all day.

27:21.240 --> 27:22.574
Come on.
Please, just try.

27:25.745 --> 27:28.180
I'm getting Phoebe, and we're
finding our way out of here.

27:29.816 --> 27:32.551
If you love me,
you'll listen.

27:32.584 --> 27:34.153
I'm doing this
<i>because</i> I love you.

27:43.662 --> 27:44.831
I tried.

27:46.398 --> 27:48.367
I tried to warn him.

27:52.705 --> 27:54.173
Go back
and finish your lunch.

27:55.674 --> 27:56.843
I'll take it from here.

28:06.585 --> 28:09.555
Fingerprints ID'd
the second body.

28:09.588 --> 28:13.092
Daniel Delcarpio --
aka Ringo.

28:13.125 --> 28:15.561
Hmm. Everybody's
got a nickname.

28:15.594 --> 28:18.097
Knock, knock.
Sorry to interrupt.

28:18.130 --> 28:19.531
What can I do for you,
Harvey?

28:19.565 --> 28:21.567
Heard about the bodies
you found.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.071
They related to that truck
accident the other day?

28:26.472 --> 28:28.440
And if they were?

28:28.474 --> 28:31.343
I was the first deputy
at the scene.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.679
Thought I'd see if there was
anything I could do to help out.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.247
Make yourself at home.

28:35.281 --> 28:37.616
Working with you two

28:37.649 --> 28:39.151
might add some excitement
to my day.

28:40.486 --> 28:43.555
I think we're good
for now.

28:43.589 --> 28:46.092
Well, you know
where to find me.

28:51.998 --> 28:53.099
How is it
you saw the wreck?

28:55.267 --> 28:56.502
It's pretty far
off the road.

28:58.771 --> 29:00.539
I drive that route
all the time.

29:00.572 --> 29:02.741
I saw the skid marks.
Thought I'd check it out.

29:02.775 --> 29:04.076
And when you
got down to the truck,

29:04.110 --> 29:05.344
did you see
anything else?

29:07.113 --> 29:09.215
No. Why?

29:09.248 --> 29:12.018
'Cause someone got to the wreck
and moved those bodies.

29:13.953 --> 29:16.755
Well, it wasn't me,
if that's what you're asking.

29:16.789 --> 29:19.025
No, not at all. We're just
trying to figure things out.

29:22.128 --> 29:23.495
What's that?

29:23.529 --> 29:25.264
I found it
near the scene.

29:25.297 --> 29:27.266
Looks like something
a kid would do.

29:27.299 --> 29:29.635
You see it
when you arrived?

29:32.638 --> 29:33.840
Like I said,
I didn't see anything.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.644
Got it.
Thanks, Deputy.

29:40.980 --> 29:43.582
By the way, whatever happened
with Ronald Pergman?

29:43.615 --> 29:45.484
He still out there?

29:45.517 --> 29:47.753
I just hope working stuff
like this isn't keeping you

29:47.786 --> 29:50.422
from chasing that monster.

30:06.172 --> 30:07.806
Oh, Travis wants
to meet with me.

30:07.840 --> 30:10.242
Oh, Travis.
Stop.

30:11.543 --> 30:13.345
I got to check on things
at the office.

30:13.379 --> 30:15.447
We keep each other posted?
Yeah. Always.

30:19.185 --> 30:21.553
Help!

30:30.596 --> 30:32.731
Help!

30:32.764 --> 30:35.167
Help me! Please!

30:35.201 --> 30:36.702
Somebody, please!

30:36.735 --> 30:38.337
He's gonna kill me!
Please!

30:38.370 --> 30:40.506
Take it easy, darlin'.
Is somebody after you?

30:42.841 --> 30:44.410
I've already called Brian, and
they think that's a dead end,

30:44.443 --> 30:46.845
so I'm not really sure
what you want to do.

30:46.879 --> 30:48.514
The lease, do you
want me to check and see
if the lease is in there?

30:48.547 --> 30:50.016
I guess.

30:50.049 --> 30:51.583
Jerrie, you getting a dog,
or what?

30:51.617 --> 30:53.819
Uh, n-no, it's, um...

30:57.023 --> 30:58.390
I was just
doing some research.

30:58.424 --> 30:59.558
It's okay.

31:04.130 --> 31:06.332
Dewell and Hoyt.
Denise here.

31:06.365 --> 31:09.401
<i>Please, help me! I-I've
been kidnapped and abducted!</i>

31:09.435 --> 31:11.037
<i>My name is Tonya Wallis.
I'm in a restaurant.</i>

31:11.070 --> 31:12.571
There's nothing else around.

31:12.604 --> 31:14.040
I think it's near
the county line, I think.

31:14.073 --> 31:16.175
Okay, honey. Okay, honey.
Slow down.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.110
Tonya, this is Cassie.
What's going on?

31:18.144 --> 31:19.411
Please,
he's gonna kill me!

31:21.247 --> 31:23.049
Oh, my God, please!
He's here!

31:23.082 --> 31:25.717
No, please hurry!
Please!

31:25.751 --> 31:28.520
No!

31:28.554 --> 31:30.722
I think I know where
she's talking about.

31:30.756 --> 31:32.891
Text us when you get
that location. Grab your gun.
Okay.

31:39.431 --> 31:42.234
No!

31:42.268 --> 31:45.071
He's gonna kill me.
Please, he's gonna kill me.

31:45.104 --> 31:48.207
Please,
he's gonna kill me.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.708
Please, you have to --

31:49.741 --> 31:51.510
He's gonna kill me!
He's gonna kill me!

31:52.744 --> 31:54.380
You shouldn't have
done that.

32:15.634 --> 32:18.104
Hey.
Hey.

32:20.372 --> 32:22.174
Jesus,
what happened?

32:22.208 --> 32:23.809
No, it's nothing.
Come on.

32:23.842 --> 32:26.112
It's just hazards of the job,
that's all.

32:26.145 --> 32:27.279
You said
you've got something?

32:27.313 --> 32:29.915
Yeah. Word is the cartel
sent a cleaner down.

32:29.948 --> 32:30.983
You know who they sent?

32:31.017 --> 32:32.518
No.

32:32.551 --> 32:36.355
If -- If I find a location
on Tonya,

32:36.388 --> 32:39.758
okay, I will --
I will do what I can.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.327
Hey, but no promises.

32:42.828 --> 32:44.863
Stop.
I know that look.

32:44.896 --> 32:45.964
Thank you.

32:45.998 --> 32:47.399
You're welcome.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.603
You need to be
more careful.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.672
I know.

32:56.175 --> 32:57.476
Come here.

33:05.551 --> 33:07.486
Mm.

33:07.519 --> 33:09.888
No, no, no. Ignore that.
Come on. Ignore it.

33:09.921 --> 33:13.059
I can't. Stop.
It's Cassie.

33:14.360 --> 33:15.527
Hey, what's up?

33:19.865 --> 33:21.400
I'll be right there.

33:21.433 --> 33:22.634
You okay?

33:22.668 --> 33:24.403
I'll call you later.

33:37.049 --> 33:39.751
Ronald, Ronald, Ronald,
Ronald, Ronald, Ronald,

33:39.785 --> 33:40.986
Ronald, Ronald, Ronald.

33:44.290 --> 33:46.425
Sometimes you just
have to let a dog run.

33:46.458 --> 33:47.993
What do you want?

33:48.026 --> 33:50.562
I told you what I wanted.

33:50.596 --> 33:52.364
I gave you specific
instructions,

33:52.398 --> 33:54.433
and what did you do?

33:54.466 --> 33:56.835
You tried to pervert Scarlet
to your cause.

33:56.868 --> 33:59.238
Scarlet is my girlfriend!

33:59.271 --> 34:01.873
And what did she tell you
would happen?

34:01.907 --> 34:03.909
She said
I'd go back.

34:03.942 --> 34:07.246
And you <i>will</i> go back.

34:07.279 --> 34:09.948
But first, I'm gonna
give you what you wanted.

34:09.981 --> 34:11.283
I want to get out of here.

34:11.317 --> 34:13.185
No. No.

34:13.219 --> 34:14.553
You wanted
clear boundaries.

34:14.586 --> 34:17.389
What,
you misbehave as a child

34:17.423 --> 34:19.125
and your mommy gave you
a spanking, is that it?

34:19.158 --> 34:20.692
Leave my mother
out of this.

34:20.726 --> 34:23.262
I showed you
the face of a friend!

34:26.898 --> 34:28.400
But you behaved
like a little boy...

34:30.102 --> 34:32.070
...so I'm gonna give you

34:32.104 --> 34:33.505
what a little boy gets.

34:35.307 --> 34:36.875
A nap.

34:46.852 --> 34:47.986
Tonya?

34:55.494 --> 34:57.129
Tonya.

34:57.163 --> 34:59.064
Tonya!

35:06.037 --> 35:08.307
Easy. Just me.

35:18.350 --> 35:19.618
I'm gonna keep checking.

35:27.993 --> 35:30.429
Okay. Are we good to go?
Uh, yeah, we're good to go.

35:30.462 --> 35:32.164
So we'll take the bags
to my place and then
we'll keep them there

35:32.198 --> 35:34.333
until we make the deal
with Dylan.

35:34.366 --> 35:37.169
Um, are you sure
he can sell them?

35:37.203 --> 35:38.337
I guess we'll see.

35:41.540 --> 35:42.474
You okay?

35:44.876 --> 35:46.412
Harp, do you...

35:48.380 --> 35:50.816
You know,
do you like me,

35:50.849 --> 35:54.052
or is it more about
the money for you?

35:54.085 --> 35:55.387
I mean, I do care about
the money...

35:57.223 --> 35:58.957
...but I care about you,
too.

Good day?

37:28.847 --> 37:30.248
Here we go.

37:33.452 --> 37:36.755
We figure Tonya
was being held in the area,

37:36.788 --> 37:38.557
got here on foot,
made a call to Cassie,

37:38.590 --> 37:40.125
and was taken again.

37:40.158 --> 37:41.927
The store owner's a witness,
which gets him killed.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.296
She called Cassie before
the police? What's that about?

37:45.764 --> 37:47.766
Hey. I'm thinking
we search the area.

37:47.799 --> 37:49.234
Maybe somebody
saw something.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.669
There's not much
around here but woods.

37:50.702 --> 37:52.904
Well, I saw a construction
trailer on the way.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.606
I think it might be
a new development site.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.575
Yeah, I guess no shortage
of those nowadays.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.810
It's worth a shot.
Let's go.
Hold on.

37:58.844 --> 38:00.979
Jenny, give me a sec.

38:06.485 --> 38:08.186
What is it?
You were
the first officer here.

38:08.219 --> 38:09.455
You need to process
this crime scene.

38:09.488 --> 38:11.289
Have someone else do it.
Tonya's still missing.

38:11.323 --> 38:14.025
Look, you're not
a P.I. anymore.

38:14.059 --> 38:15.794
Meaning?
Meaning I can't have you
just running around

38:15.827 --> 38:17.496
doing whatever you want.

38:17.529 --> 38:19.798
There's a way we do things
inside the department.

38:19.831 --> 38:21.700
I have to at least
pretend I'm treating you
like everybody else.

38:21.733 --> 38:23.034
This is ridiculous.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.538
We're working against the clock.
We got to go.

38:29.975 --> 38:31.643
I got to work things here.

38:31.677 --> 38:33.379
Look, you two go.

38:33.412 --> 38:35.213
Be careful, and call me
if there's anything.

38:37.248 --> 38:38.984
Got it.

38:39.017 --> 38:40.619
Thank you.

38:52.030 --> 38:54.199
Long day, Madge?

38:54.232 --> 38:56.868
They're all long
at my age.

38:56.902 --> 38:58.203
Get out while you can.

38:58.236 --> 38:59.538
That's the plan.

39:02.541 --> 39:04.342
Hey, uh...

39:04.376 --> 39:06.745
remember that kid came in
the other day?

39:06.778 --> 39:08.313
Wanted to report a crime?

39:08.346 --> 39:10.416
The day after
the truck accident.

39:10.449 --> 39:11.683
I do.

39:11.717 --> 39:13.519
Great.

39:13.552 --> 39:16.488
He didn't happen to
sign in or anything, did he?

39:16.522 --> 39:18.089
Why?

39:19.591 --> 39:20.592
Come on.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.736
Slow down. How did the bodies
end up in the creek?

39:30.769 --> 39:32.137
Somebody must have moved them
after we left.

39:34.072 --> 39:36.041
How do you know
any of this?

39:36.074 --> 39:38.510
I heard some chatter
on my police scanner
about some bodies,

39:38.544 --> 39:39.845
and so I decided to go
down there and check it out.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.212
Wait, you actually
went there?

39:41.246 --> 39:42.881
Did anyone see you?

39:42.914 --> 39:44.382
No, just blending in
with the crowd.

39:44.416 --> 39:47.085
Me and this
really freaky lady, yeah.

39:47.118 --> 39:49.254
What about the cop
that shot the driver?

39:49.287 --> 39:50.889
Was he there?

39:50.922 --> 39:53.959
Uh, no. I actually didn't
see him at all.

39:53.992 --> 39:55.226
But, I mean,
he had to be the one

39:55.260 --> 39:56.928
that moved the bodies,
right?

39:56.962 --> 39:59.665
Maybe he didn't want anyone
to find out what he did.

40:03.502 --> 40:05.303
This is really bad.

40:05.336 --> 40:07.105
We need to tell
Max and Harper.

40:09.808 --> 40:11.309
You're right, we do.

40:11.342 --> 40:12.644
But this doesn't
change anything.

40:12.678 --> 40:13.912
No one knows
what we did.

40:13.945 --> 40:16.114
Everything is
going to be fine, okay?

40:17.248 --> 40:18.550
Yeah.

40:22.754 --> 40:25.423
That lady... I have
a weird feeling about her.

40:25.457 --> 40:28.126
She kept talking about
dead bodies. Like, a lot.

40:28.159 --> 40:30.028
I don't think we need to
tell Max and Harper about that.

40:32.430 --> 40:33.999
Okay.

40:38.870 --> 40:42.107
There you go.
This is it.

40:42.140 --> 40:43.742
Bridger Ryan.

40:47.479 --> 40:48.514
Thanks, Madge.

41:22.981 --> 41:24.516
What am I supposed
to do with you?

41:24.550 --> 41:26.051
You ran!

41:26.084 --> 41:28.153
You hurt Donno.

41:28.186 --> 41:29.721
Actually,
you get points for that one.

41:29.755 --> 41:31.557
Easy.
"Easy" yourself.

41:31.590 --> 41:34.059
You killed someone tonight.
Now we have a problem.

41:34.092 --> 41:35.594
I killed someone
because of her.

41:37.262 --> 41:39.565
Well, she didn't run
from herself, did she?

41:41.600 --> 41:43.001
No.

41:48.540 --> 41:49.575
Hey.

41:52.611 --> 41:54.546
I think we got
a bigger problem.

41:59.785 --> 42:02.187
If you don't
take care of it...

42:02.220 --> 42:03.555
I will.

42:53.171 --> 42:55.140
