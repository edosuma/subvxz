01:25.728 --> 01:27.869
Burns, you're
coming with us.

01:27.937 --> 01:29.307
No, no, let me go.

01:29.378 --> 01:31.249
<i>Surprised?</i>

01:31.316 --> 01:33.662
<i>Me, C. Montgomery Burns,
locked up like an animal?</i>

01:33.730 --> 01:36.541
<i>What caused this puzzling turn
of events?</i>

01:36.609 --> 01:38.617
<i>Well, I'll tell you my tale...</i>

01:38.685 --> 01:41.324
<i>by thinking about it to myself.</i>

01:43.726 --> 01:47.268
And so our Employee of the Month
is the late Roger Ducette,

01:47.336 --> 01:50.776
who tragically died from
complications due to union organizing.

01:51.516 --> 01:54.087
Moving on, the power plant's
first annual Fourth of July picnic

01:54.155 --> 01:55.525
is this coming Saturday.

01:55.593 --> 01:56.895
Whoo-hoo!

01:56.963 --> 01:59.002
Oh, I'm afraid
you misunderstand.

01:59.070 --> 02:01.042
This picnic is for me.

02:01.110 --> 02:04.252
You will all be spending your
Independence Day slaving away

02:04.320 --> 02:07.228
in the hot summer sun without
pay, lotion or gratitude.

02:07.296 --> 02:08.031
D'oh!

02:08.098 --> 02:10.501
Yes, "duh-ohhh," indeed.

02:24.920 --> 02:27.358
Sir, your spareribs, cooked
just the way you like 'em.

02:27.936 --> 02:30.106
Spareribs, eh?

02:30.174 --> 02:32.879
I've played a round of tenpins
or two in my life,

02:32.947 --> 02:35.718
and to me, the word "spare"
reeks of second best.

02:35.786 --> 02:38.323
Give me ten full frames
of strike ribs.

02:38.390 --> 02:39.860
And you, find my doctor

02:39.927 --> 02:41.698
and ask him why I'd
ask for something

02:41.766 --> 02:43.502
- as insane as strike ribs.
- Yes, sir.

02:43.569 --> 02:45.338
You know, sir,
these people have been working

02:45.406 --> 02:47.509
since your 6:00 a.m.
parade of the flags.

02:47.577 --> 02:49.880
Maybe you could give them
the rest of the day off

02:49.948 --> 02:51.584
to spend with their families?

02:51.651 --> 02:53.821
Yes, they should go.
Just as soon as they perform

02:53.889 --> 02:55.123
this musical I've written

02:55.191 --> 02:56.225
in celebration
of our nation's birth.

02:56.293 --> 02:58.063
Grab your scripts, people.

02:58.130 --> 03:01.035
We open in 20 minutes.
Break a leg.

03:01.103 --> 03:03.305
I said break a leg.

03:04.943 --> 03:07.279
For God's sake, man,
it's a figure of speech.

03:07.347 --> 03:09.850
You're fired.

03:09.918 --> 03:15.594
 * We love America. *

03:35.928 --> 03:37.429
Meh.

03:37.497 --> 03:40.535
Smithers, take my hands
and clap them sarcastically.

03:43.373 --> 03:44.675
More sarcastic.

03:44.742 --> 03:46.578
Burns, what an ungrateful jerk.

03:46.645 --> 03:49.515
We hoofed our hearts out for him
with no rehearsal.

03:49.584 --> 03:51.553
I say Burns owes us a party.

03:51.620 --> 03:54.958
Let's have one
right now... with his wine.

04:00.132 --> 04:01.533
I don't know.

04:01.601 --> 04:03.336
Technically,
this is trespassing.

04:03.403 --> 04:05.606
What's the worst
thing he could do?

04:08.745 --> 04:10.680
Hey, Lenny,

04:10.748 --> 04:13.418
you care for some Chateau
La Mondotte Saint-Emilion?

04:13.486 --> 04:15.020
That's a regular-sized bottle.

04:15.087 --> 04:16.956
I'm drinking Jeroboams.

04:17.023 --> 04:19.426
I'm pounding
Melchizedeks.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.797
Homer, that's
a $60,000 bottle.

04:22.865 --> 04:23.899
Whoo-hoo.

04:23.967 --> 04:25.501
I'm drinking my salary.

04:25.570 --> 04:27.638
Yeah, but don't some of that go
to income tax?

04:27.706 --> 04:28.774
Yeah, you're right.

04:28.841 --> 04:29.942
The government...

04:30.010 --> 04:31.578
taking my hard-earned
stolen wine

04:31.646 --> 04:33.281
and spending it on
that no-good floor.

04:33.349 --> 04:35.316
I hear that.

04:35.384 --> 04:38.020
<i>I'm getting radioactive right now.</i>

04:47.763 --> 04:48.930
Smithers, sound the alarum.

04:48.998 --> 04:50.232
Summon the shire reeve.

04:50.299 --> 04:53.335
Wake the beadle.

04:59.741 --> 05:03.209
Okay, left hand:
Rembrandt.

05:05.811 --> 05:08.479
All right, step away
from the old masters

05:08.547 --> 05:10.747
and kick 'em over here.
Come on.

05:10.815 --> 05:12.549
Whoa, wait a minute, Chief.

05:12.617 --> 05:14.184
- This is The Concert by Vermeer.
- Huh?

05:14.252 --> 05:16.453
Which was stolen in 1990

05:16.521 --> 05:19.154
from Boston's Isabella
Stewart Gardner Museum.

05:19.222 --> 05:21.323
So, Burns,

05:21.391 --> 05:24.125
do you want to explain
how this miracle of measure

05:24.193 --> 05:25.792
and harmony got into
your collection?

05:25.859 --> 05:28.094
Well, I... you, you see...

05:28.161 --> 05:29.528
It's just...

05:29.596 --> 05:32.063
Is it a crime
to want nice things,

05:32.131 --> 05:34.832
and then to steal them
from a public museum

05:34.900 --> 05:36.467
where any gum-chewing monkey

05:36.535 --> 05:38.936
in a Tufts University jacket
can gawk at them?

05:39.003 --> 05:40.805
I think not!

05:40.873 --> 05:42.741
Cuff him, Lou.

05:45.577 --> 05:48.445
<i>The entire town turned out
to jeer me.</i>

05:48.512 --> 05:51.347
<i>Me, whose velvet breeches
their lizard lips</i>

05:51.415 --> 05:54.583
<i>had so often
joylessly smooched.</i>

05:59.354 --> 06:01.455
Throwin' stuff.
Get yer throwin' stuff.

06:01.522 --> 06:03.723
Turn a protest into a riot.

06:03.790 --> 06:05.257
How much for a tomato?

06:05.325 --> 06:07.591
Fresh is a dollar,
rotten's two bucks.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.459
Son, do you really need
the rotten?

06:09.527 --> 06:11.729
I mean, it's not like
you're actually gonna hit him.

06:13.064 --> 06:17.000
Oh... since it's your birthday.

06:18.735 --> 06:21.136
Mom, I'm gonna go hurl
rotten fruit.

06:21.204 --> 06:23.071
No one in this
family is hurling

06:23.139 --> 06:24.473
rotten anything
at anyone.

06:25.908 --> 06:27.842
And just what might that be?

06:27.910 --> 06:30.211
Uh... this is my lunch.

06:30.278 --> 06:31.412
Really?

06:31.480 --> 06:32.579
Okay, eat your lunch.

06:32.647 --> 06:33.680
But...

06:33.748 --> 06:34.915
You said it's your lunch.

06:34.982 --> 06:36.082
- Eat it.
- Eat my lunch?

06:36.150 --> 06:37.217
Yes. Enjoy.

06:37.284 --> 06:39.552
- Okay, I will.
- <i>Bon appÃƒÂ©tit</i>.

06:39.619 --> 06:42.421
<i>They continued for some time
in this vein, until...</i>

06:42.488 --> 06:43.955
You don't think I'm going to?

06:44.023 --> 06:45.323
I don't see any chewing.

06:45.391 --> 06:46.824
Okay.

06:46.892 --> 06:48.826
Not air bites, real bites.

06:48.894 --> 06:49.760
Oh...

06:54.532 --> 06:56.632
- Where are you going?
- Shopping.

06:56.700 --> 06:59.201
Every time this town riots,
the malls are deserted.

06:59.269 --> 07:00.535
You stay here.

07:00.603 --> 07:02.671
I hate being stuck at home.

07:02.739 --> 07:04.006
Play with Lisa.

07:04.073 --> 07:05.874
Mom, you don't play with Lisa.

07:05.942 --> 07:07.175
You play despite her.

07:07.243 --> 07:09.677
Bart, I'm not
thrilled either,

07:09.744 --> 07:11.211
but one day we might
need each other

07:11.279 --> 07:12.612
for organ transplants,

07:12.680 --> 07:15.181
so we'd better keep
the lines of communication open.

07:15.249 --> 07:17.016
Want to help me
with my ant farm?

07:17.084 --> 07:18.918
You plant the ants,
and then they grow?

07:18.986 --> 07:21.587
No, the ants are the farmers.

07:21.655 --> 07:22.955
Really? What are
they growing?

07:23.023 --> 07:25.324
Nothing. Look, do you want
to do it or not?

07:25.392 --> 07:26.825
- No!
- Fine.

07:26.893 --> 07:29.427
So ironic.

07:29.495 --> 07:31.996
After all my years
of stock jobbing,

07:32.064 --> 07:33.264
gun running,
attempted murder,

07:33.332 --> 07:35.532
successful murder,
and tom-peepery,

07:35.599 --> 07:38.100
they get me on a petty
multimillion dollar art theft.

07:38.168 --> 07:39.902
It's so unfair.

07:39.970 --> 07:41.870
Smithers, until I am released,

07:41.938 --> 07:44.439
you shall be running
the nuclear plant.

07:44.507 --> 07:45.474
Me?

07:45.541 --> 07:47.108
Be strong, Smithers.

07:47.176 --> 07:48.710
Be strong for the plant.

07:48.777 --> 07:50.077
She needs you.

07:52.178 --> 07:54.246
<i>This would have been a perfect
time for it to start raining.</i>

07:54.313 --> 07:57.082
<i>Oh, what the hell.
I'm telling this story.</i>

07:59.752 --> 08:03.721
<i>Hmm. Not dramatic enough.</i>

08:03.789 --> 08:05.657
<i>Frostbite took his nose.</i>

08:05.725 --> 08:07.959
<i>Excellent.</i>

08:10.644 --> 08:13.031
<i>That prison
was like a prison to me.</i>

08:13.031 --> 08:15.065
<i>Not a prison of bricks
and iron,</i>

08:15.133 --> 08:16.900
<i>but one of steel and cement.</i>

08:16.968 --> 08:18.535
<i>They took everything from me.</i>

08:18.603 --> 08:22.237
One movie stub from
Tillie's Punctured Romance,

08:22.305 --> 08:24.873
envelope marked "bribe."

08:24.940 --> 08:27.208
Empty.

08:28.844 --> 08:30.678
Social Security card.

08:30.745 --> 08:33.347
That's just an S.S.
card, you Dummkopf.

08:33.414 --> 08:37.150
<i>My only hope lay
in befriending the warden.</i>

08:37.217 --> 08:39.018
Now you looky here, Burns.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.553
All your money and influence

08:40.621 --> 08:42.022
don't mean nothin'
on the inside.

08:42.089 --> 08:44.924
Yes, but a wealthy man
can buy information,

08:44.992 --> 08:49.229
information that can be highly
damaging to a certain warden.

08:49.296 --> 08:51.998
Well, uh, what information
we talkin' 'bout?

08:52.066 --> 08:54.267
Well, I'm sure the boys
at the city desk

08:54.335 --> 08:57.137
would be interested to learn
that you're addicted to...

08:57.204 --> 08:58.705
to...

09:00.274 --> 09:01.975
Can't read my own writing.

09:02.043 --> 09:05.078
But I'll tell you this, Warden,
it starts with an "H."

09:05.146 --> 09:06.746
Ham?

09:06.814 --> 09:08.448
It's clearly more
than three letters.

09:08.549 --> 09:10.084
Get him out of my sight.

09:17.123 --> 09:20.058
Ain't nobody gonna take my H
from me.

09:21.694 --> 09:23.461
Damn, that gas is noble.

09:43.840 --> 09:45.973
Time for a cavity search.

09:46.041 --> 09:47.441
Oh.

09:47.509 --> 09:49.677
I haven't had a cavity
in over 40 years.

09:49.745 --> 09:51.812
I wasn't talking
about your teeth.

09:51.880 --> 09:53.714
Nor was I.

09:55.517 --> 09:57.384
Meet your roommate.

09:58.852 --> 10:00.184
Hiya, pal.

10:00.252 --> 10:01.682
They put two harmless

10:01.750 --> 10:03.117
white collar criminals
in the same cell.

10:03.185 --> 10:04.552
What luck, huh?

10:06.354 --> 10:08.087
I was afraid you'd be
some tattooed bruiser.

10:08.155 --> 10:10.589
Well, they don't turn out
too many of those at Dartmouth.

10:10.657 --> 10:13.858
Dartmouth?! Get me away from
this hideous brute at once.

10:13.926 --> 10:15.460
At once! Do you hear me?!

10:15.528 --> 10:17.396
Got my master's from the
University of Virginia,

10:17.464 --> 10:18.831
the public Ivy.

10:18.899 --> 10:20.165
Guard!

10:21.734 --> 10:23.736
Such an intricate formicarium.

10:23.803 --> 10:26.936
I'm the proudest myrmecologist
on the block.

10:27.004 --> 10:29.405
Hey, they're not eating.

10:29.473 --> 10:31.307
Don't worry.
I gave 'em a Pop-Tart.

10:31.374 --> 10:33.342
The healthy kind--
strawberry-frosted.

10:33.410 --> 10:36.579
Bart, that Pop-Tart wasn't
locally farmed or sourced.

10:36.646 --> 10:39.046
Oh, Lisa, you take the fun
out of everything.

10:39.114 --> 10:41.681
I am so glad
I am not your kid.

10:41.749 --> 10:43.716
Well, I'm so glad
I'm not your mom.

10:43.783 --> 10:45.283
You should be.

10:45.351 --> 10:47.985
If I was in your tummy,
I'd poo in your throat.

10:48.053 --> 10:51.221
Ew. Ew. Ew. I'll never get
that image out of my head.

10:51.289 --> 10:53.859
Oh, no. You are not
taking the children.

10:53.927 --> 10:55.295
If they're anybody's children,
they're mine.

10:59.199 --> 11:01.333
Quick, we've got
to get them back.

11:07.872 --> 11:09.738
There's only one ant left.

11:09.806 --> 11:12.139
I will never forgive you.

11:13.574 --> 11:15.174
Aw...

11:15.242 --> 11:18.143
Well, I will never
forgive you, Bart.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.811
That only angers me more!

11:19.879 --> 11:21.812
I know.

11:32.390 --> 11:34.524
Okay, Waylon,
you never wanted this job,

11:34.592 --> 11:35.858
but you got it.

11:38.295 --> 11:39.696
Damn it!

11:42.267 --> 11:45.069
You know, this is my chance.

11:45.137 --> 11:48.505
A chance to be
the kind of boss I want to be.

11:48.573 --> 11:51.510
A little more...
employee-friendly.

11:51.578 --> 11:54.548
Mmm. That was
a wild Christmas party.

11:56.250 --> 11:58.151
In the next few weeks,
we'll be introducing

11:58.218 --> 11:59.819
a medical plan
that covers illness,

11:59.887 --> 12:01.854
and a suggestion box
that is no longer

12:01.922 --> 12:03.322
a guillotine for the hand.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.257
Yeah!

12:05.324 --> 12:07.391
Well, I agree things
are a lot nicer around here,

12:07.459 --> 12:10.025
but I think I speak
for many of us when I say,

12:10.093 --> 12:11.059
what's the catch?

12:12.194 --> 12:13.461
Well, the catch is,

12:13.529 --> 12:15.296
happy workers
are productive workers.

12:15.364 --> 12:17.565
There's always a catch!

12:19.101 --> 12:21.502
Can I come in?

12:21.570 --> 12:23.404
You're not going
anywhere near Annie.

12:23.472 --> 12:24.605
Annie?

12:24.673 --> 12:26.607
As in "Little Orphan"?

12:26.675 --> 12:29.577
It was an accident,
I didn't mean to kill our ants.

12:29.645 --> 12:31.412
Patty and Selma
are dead?

12:31.480 --> 12:32.547
Whoo-hoo

12:32.614 --> 12:34.015
A double funeral!

12:37.252 --> 12:39.615
Dad, before you
jump to conclusions...

12:39.683 --> 12:41.082
Oh, please,
tell me they suffered.

12:42.250 --> 12:45.151
Gh-gh-gh... hags!

12:48.521 --> 12:50.989
Looks like it's Pledge Day.

12:51.056 --> 12:53.823
Which jailhouse fraternity
shall I join?

12:53.891 --> 12:55.591
The Shriners?

12:55.659 --> 12:57.493
The ROTC?

12:57.560 --> 12:59.361
The Sunday Funnies?

12:59.428 --> 13:01.962
Or one of these other
dining clubs?

13:02.030 --> 13:04.430
Look at them circling me
like I'm Cinderella,

13:04.497 --> 13:05.964
belle of the ball.

13:06.031 --> 13:07.465
Back off!

13:07.532 --> 13:09.399
He's mine.

13:10.901 --> 13:12.669
Warden, help me!

13:12.736 --> 13:13.936
No can do, baby.

13:14.004 --> 13:16.240
I'm not coming down for days!

13:17.875 --> 13:21.010
Mr. Smithers, our lives
are awesome, thanks to you.

13:21.078 --> 13:24.012
And because I know you...
like your loafers light,

13:24.080 --> 13:26.781
I want to give something back.

13:26.848 --> 13:27.815
Wip!

13:29.218 --> 13:31.254
Use that image
any way you want.

13:31.322 --> 13:32.722
Three cheers
for Mr. Smithers!

13:32.789 --> 13:34.356
To Mr. Smithers!

13:34.424 --> 13:36.693
Hooray!

13:38.163 --> 13:39.530
Uh, listen,
uh, can I leave

13:39.598 --> 13:40.897
a little early tomorrow?

13:40.965 --> 13:42.866
My kid has a thing.

13:42.933 --> 13:44.602
Ooh, yeah, can I
leave early, too?

13:44.670 --> 13:47.137
I want to take a nap so I'm
awake for the meteor shower.

13:49.273 --> 13:50.840
Well, I'm flexible. Go ahead.

13:50.908 --> 13:52.341
You know, I used
to think you was

13:52.409 --> 13:54.276
just as bad as Mr. Burns.

13:54.344 --> 13:56.378
Now, I think you're
just as good as me.

13:56.446 --> 13:58.782
Oh, that is
a huge compliment.

14:00.386 --> 14:02.189
Uh, excuse me.

14:03.858 --> 14:07.393
Yes, the service on my car
was excellent.

14:07.461 --> 14:08.994
Five out of five.

14:09.062 --> 14:10.429
Four out of five.

14:10.497 --> 14:11.963
Five out of five.

14:12.031 --> 14:13.798
Uh, excuse me, can I go back

14:13.866 --> 14:16.200
and change that four out of five
to five out of five?

14:16.267 --> 14:18.434
I'm wasting your time?

14:18.502 --> 14:21.036
Smithers, what a
marshmallow. I don't have

14:21.104 --> 14:22.770
a thing with my
kid tomorrow.

14:22.838 --> 14:24.039
You told me you did.

14:24.107 --> 14:25.675
I do, but I'm not
going to it.

14:25.743 --> 14:26.909
To Smithers,

14:26.977 --> 14:28.844
the world's dumbest loser.

14:28.912 --> 14:30.846
There'nothing
sweeter than being nice

14:30.914 --> 14:33.114
to a guy's face and then
stabbing him in the back

14:33.182 --> 14:34.415
the minute he walks away.

14:34.482 --> 14:36.216
All right, that's it.

14:36.284 --> 14:37.618
You know,

14:37.686 --> 14:39.487
I used to wonder why Mr. Burns

14:39.554 --> 14:40.921
hated humanity.

14:40.989 --> 14:42.556
Now I know.

14:42.624 --> 14:46.359
You open your heart
and they mock your very decency.

14:46.427 --> 14:49.362
Ooh, we mock
your very decency.

14:56.298 --> 14:59.367
Man, Smithers is working us
like dogs.

14:59.435 --> 15:00.735
Well, at least we got

15:00.803 --> 15:02.801
the best brand
ceiling insulation.

15:05.391 --> 15:07.491
Well, at least we got
the best asbestos.

15:11.895 --> 15:13.429
I've told you,
you're mine.

15:13.497 --> 15:16.197
And you can't escape the word

15:16.265 --> 15:18.133
of Jesus Christ.

15:18.201 --> 15:20.401
Burns, you shall
reject Satan.

15:20.469 --> 15:22.136
Why can't you
reject your guy?

15:22.204 --> 15:24.137
Because when I
wad at my lowest

15:24.205 --> 15:26.739
facing 50 years to life,

15:26.807 --> 15:29.276
<i>someone handed me a book.</i>

15:29.344 --> 15:31.579
<i>I couldn't read a lick,</i>

15:31.646 --> 15:33.714
<i>but that picture of Jesus</i>

15:33.782 --> 15:35.715
<i>gave me a comfort
I've never known.</i>

15:37.317 --> 15:38.817
So I promised the Lord

15:38.885 --> 15:41.019
I'd put that 50 years to use

15:41.087 --> 15:44.121
reclaiming lost souls like you.

15:44.189 --> 15:45.689
Come to Jesus!

15:45.757 --> 15:46.957
Shan't.

15:47.025 --> 15:48.559
Feel his power!

15:48.626 --> 15:50.494
I've died and come
back... it's overrated.

15:50.561 --> 15:52.596
Open your heart!

15:54.065 --> 15:56.266
I will suck out your evil.

16:02.038 --> 16:04.372
And now, your evil is gone!

16:04.439 --> 16:07.543
I'm afraid that
was just my pre-evil.

16:18.352 --> 16:19.752
I feel it.

16:19.820 --> 16:22.288
I feel the love
coursing through my vein.

16:23.757 --> 16:25.857
Welcome to the Lord,
brother.

16:25.925 --> 16:28.293
<i>So, that hellhole
became a Heavenhole.</i>

16:28.361 --> 16:30.462
<i>I joined the prison choir.</i>

16:30.529 --> 16:32.663
<i>And the the prison
Beatles' tribute band.</i>

16:32.731 --> 16:35.165
<i>I raked a Zen garden
in the courtyard</i>

16:35.233 --> 16:38.401
<i>and found a peace and serenity
I'd never known.</i>

16:48.812 --> 16:51.046
Who's carrying
50 times her weight?

16:51.113 --> 16:53.480
- Ooh, you are.
- <i>Bart?</i>

16:53.548 --> 16:56.115
She's only carrying
30 times her weight.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.916
Our girl is slowing down.

16:57.984 --> 17:00.786
Oh, my God.
That is so sad.

17:00.854 --> 17:02.888
It's the natural
order of things.

17:02.955 --> 17:04.789
I'm afraid she's
got another two,

17:04.857 --> 17:06.992
maybe three days, tops.

17:07.059 --> 17:09.594
Do we let her spend the rest
of her life in the wild?

17:09.662 --> 17:12.030
Or let her die in captivity,
like Grampa?

17:12.098 --> 17:14.333
Hey, in my mind I'm free.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.335
<i>No you're not, ya idjit!</i>

17:17.736 --> 17:20.367
It's official.

17:20.435 --> 17:22.868
Smithers is now
worse than Mr. Burns.

17:22.935 --> 17:25.538
Instead of releasing hounds,
he releases wolverines.

17:33.011 --> 17:34.611
I never thought
I'd say this,

17:34.679 --> 17:36.646
but I wish Mr. Burns
was back.

17:36.714 --> 17:38.981
Hey, if wishes were
horses, I'd be eatin'

17:39.049 --> 17:41.383
- wish-meat every night.
- What does that mean?

17:41.451 --> 17:43.719
It means, it's not like you're
gonna break into the prison

17:43.787 --> 17:44.922
and bust him out or anything.

17:46.691 --> 17:49.158
Oh, hey, come on.
You can't really

17:49.226 --> 17:51.191
be serious about
breaking him out.

17:51.259 --> 17:52.858
It's too late
to turn back, Moe.

17:52.926 --> 17:55.360
We've exchanged
meaningful looks.

17:55.428 --> 17:56.894
No, you can still turn back.

17:56.962 --> 17:58.663
The point of no return
is the whispered huddle.

18:00.131 --> 18:01.868
Oh, God. Oh, God!

18:10.710 --> 18:12.677
- Burns, you're coming with us.
- No.

18:12.745 --> 18:14.445
No, let me go.

18:14.513 --> 18:16.280
Why would I want
to leave the place

18:16.347 --> 18:18.114
where my soul was saved?

18:19.383 --> 18:21.217
<i>And that's where we came in.</i>

18:21.285 --> 18:23.052
<i>Now, without further ado,</i>

18:23.119 --> 18:25.053
<i>here's what happened next.</i>

18:25.121 --> 18:28.089
<i>But first, I'll daydream
about a sport utility vehicle,</i>

18:28.157 --> 18:31.159
<i>a crispy chicken sandwich
and a wonderful blue pill.</i>

18:34.651 --> 18:37.051
<i>Hold it right there!</i>

18:37.119 --> 18:38.820
You're not leaving
with that man.

18:38.887 --> 18:40.254
He's born again.

18:40.322 --> 18:43.157
Been baptized in a toilet sink.

18:43.226 --> 18:45.796
Everyone doesn't
have to know that part.

18:45.864 --> 18:47.665
It's the specific
detail that shows

18:47.733 --> 18:49.567
the humbling
you've undergone.

18:49.635 --> 18:52.103
- You don't have a "whisper"
voice, do you? - What?

18:53.937 --> 18:56.403
Good-bye, Annie,
my eight-legged friend.

18:56.471 --> 18:58.204
Ants have six legs, Bart.

18:58.272 --> 18:59.471
Oh, thank God.

18:59.539 --> 19:00.906
I thought I broke two off.

19:00.973 --> 19:04.509
You're just a tiny ant,
but you were strong enough

19:04.577 --> 19:06.544
to pull my brother
and me together.

19:06.612 --> 19:08.245
Now go and be free.

19:17.319 --> 19:19.020
Look, if I leave with you,

19:19.088 --> 19:20.922
they're just going
to throw me back in.

19:20.989 --> 19:22.589
The world has changed
since you went in.

19:22.657 --> 19:24.491
Men of wealth
can beat the system now.

19:24.559 --> 19:26.392
Yeah, and they've replaced
parking meters

19:26.460 --> 19:28.594
with this thing you stick
your credit card into.

19:28.661 --> 19:31.032
The war is over
and the future won.

19:31.099 --> 19:33.767
The past never
had a chance, man.

19:33.835 --> 19:36.972
Do you really want to
leave with these idiots?

19:39.542 --> 19:40.876
I'm afraid so.

19:40.943 --> 19:43.011
But I cleansed you
of your evil.

19:43.079 --> 19:45.313
I had a little left
between my toes.

19:45.381 --> 19:48.450
It quickly multiplied, and now
I'm a bigger bastard than ever.

19:48.518 --> 19:50.152
But I must know,

19:50.219 --> 19:52.020
what was it about me
that made you try?

19:52.088 --> 19:55.023
Because I've killed
so many rich white men,

19:55.091 --> 19:57.458
I thought I'd do right
by at least one.

19:57.526 --> 19:59.926
We're not so different,
you and I.

20:02.325 --> 20:04.057
Get your skinny
ass out of here.

20:04.125 --> 20:06.123
Lollygags,
slackabouts,

20:06.189 --> 20:08.490
Captain Happys,
you're all fired.

20:08.557 --> 20:10.791
I'll do the firing
around here.

20:10.859 --> 20:12.726
Mr. Burns!

20:12.794 --> 20:14.961
You're even more beautiful
than I remembered.

20:16.463 --> 20:18.201
All of you,
out of my office.

20:28.214 --> 20:30.082
Farewell, friend.

20:30.149 --> 20:33.519
Maybe you'll find another
lost lamb for your flock.

20:33.586 --> 20:37.522
Tell me, brother, have you heard
the story of Jesus Christ?

20:37.590 --> 20:42.060
Well, I am Italian, but no.
