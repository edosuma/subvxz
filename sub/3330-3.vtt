00:04.671 --> 00:06.405
Walter:
<i>My name is walter o'brien.</i>

00:06.407 --> 00:10.676
<i>I have the fourth highest iq</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

00:10.678 --> 00:12.544
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

00:12.546 --> 00:15.080
<i>When I was 11, the fbi</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking nasa</i>

00:15.082 --> 00:17.516
<i>To get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

00:17.518 --> 00:19.718
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

00:19.720 --> 00:21.353
<i>Tackling worldwide threats</i>

00:21.355 --> 00:22.688
<i>Only we can solve.</i>

00:22.690 --> 00:24.656
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

00:24.658 --> 00:26.492
Sylvester's a human calculator.

00:26.494 --> 00:28.660
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

00:28.662 --> 00:31.063
<i>Agent cabe gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

00:31.065 --> 00:33.265
<i>And paige?</i>
<i>Well, paige isn't like us.</i>

00:33.267 --> 00:35.534
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

00:35.536 --> 00:38.337
<i>While we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

00:38.339 --> 00:40.272
<i>Together, we are scorpion.</i>

00:41.441 --> 00:42.674
Sylvester only
seconds behind!

00:42.676 --> 00:43.809
Oh, my!

00:43.811 --> 00:45.711
But he is displaying
facial stressors.

00:45.713 --> 00:46.812
Will he choke?

00:46.814 --> 00:48.247
Will... He... Choke?

00:48.249 --> 00:49.748
Toby! Just. J... Okay?

00:49.750 --> 00:51.183
Toby:
The pace is breakneck.

00:51.185 --> 00:52.551
The tension is high.

00:52.553 --> 00:53.719
Children.

00:53.721 --> 00:57.589
This is not for the
pregnant or faint of heart.

01:00.627 --> 01:01.593
Oh, oh, oh!

01:01.595 --> 01:03.829
It's the old
blind-bomber trick!

01:03.831 --> 01:07.266
It's gutsy, it's cocky, it could
serve to psych out dodd!

01:07.268 --> 01:08.567
No.
What? N-no.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.335
No. Oh, no!
Dodd rallies!

01:10.337 --> 01:11.537
Dodd rallies!

01:11.539 --> 01:12.604
Time!

01:12.606 --> 01:15.207
Oh, oh. Ooh.

01:15.209 --> 01:16.341
(laughing)

01:16.343 --> 01:18.677
What the hell's going on?

01:18.679 --> 01:20.312
Walter wins. As usual.

01:20.314 --> 01:22.314
By a hair, pal. By a hair.

01:22.316 --> 01:24.483
Team of einsteins, none
of you could tell time?!

01:24.485 --> 01:25.851
Turn that noise
off! We're late!

01:25.853 --> 01:28.487
Oh, we were just
blowing off steam, cabe.

01:28.489 --> 01:29.655
We're ready.
Well, you better be.

01:29.657 --> 01:31.490
The future of the team
depends on it.

01:31.492 --> 01:32.825
Director merrick already
thinks I'm crazy

01:32.827 --> 01:34.460
For forming a team of geniuses.

01:34.462 --> 01:36.695
We got to prove him wrong.

01:36.697 --> 01:37.830
Guys, guys, guys.

01:38.832 --> 01:40.132
He's right.

01:40.134 --> 01:41.300
This exercise is
a huge opportunity

01:41.302 --> 01:43.368
For our company;
for all of us.

01:43.370 --> 01:45.237
I know we can do this.
We're ready.

01:45.239 --> 01:46.305
All right.

01:48.508 --> 01:49.775
Forgot my hat.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.577
Are you kidding me?!

01:51.579 --> 01:52.845
Let's go!

01:52.847 --> 01:55.514
(bell dings)
hurry up already!

01:55.516 --> 01:57.382
Come on, come on.

01:57.384 --> 01:58.717
What's the delay?

01:58.719 --> 02:00.219
These have been here
since yesterday!

02:00.221 --> 02:01.320
Move!

02:01.322 --> 02:02.788
Nemos, I just wanted
to return my uniform

02:02.790 --> 02:04.256
And get my last check.

02:06.226 --> 02:08.460
I don't understand
this new job of yours.

02:08.462 --> 02:09.761
Brilliant people.

02:09.763 --> 02:12.564
I mean, what are they?
Scientists?

02:12.566 --> 02:14.600
Geniuses. Kind of a liaison
to regular people.

02:14.602 --> 02:16.768
You know me--
good with customers.

02:16.770 --> 02:17.769
Yes, I know.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.638
That's why you should stay.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.707
How many times does an
opportunity like this

02:21.709 --> 02:22.908
Come along for me...

02:22.910 --> 02:24.776
For my son?

02:24.778 --> 02:28.380
And I never know
what this job will bring,

02:28.382 --> 02:30.549
But it's always exciting.

02:45.798 --> 02:47.166
Walter, this
is a mistake.

02:47.168 --> 02:48.300
I'm not prepared
for this.

02:48.302 --> 02:49.468
I've got
your back, buddy.

02:49.470 --> 02:50.702
I've always got
your back, okay?

02:50.704 --> 02:51.837
Commander: Approaching
the hot point.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.539
Delta team quells
the insurgency.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.174
Omega, locate
the comm room.

02:55.176 --> 02:56.642
Shepherds, the smacks.

02:56.644 --> 02:58.177
You got 30 seconds to
download that file.

02:58.179 --> 02:59.711
You copy?

02:59.713 --> 03:02.848
Except why you keep
calling us "smacks."

03:02.850 --> 03:04.750
Toby:
<i>It's an army funny.</i>

03:04.752 --> 03:08.687
Smack-- soldier, minus ability,
coordination and knowledge.

03:08.689 --> 03:11.256
The federal government, good
at acronyms and nothing else.

03:11.258 --> 03:13.659
Does he know that I'm
director of homeland security?

03:13.661 --> 03:14.793
Your superior?

03:14.795 --> 03:16.962
They're just civilians.

03:18.598 --> 03:20.265
Man: <i>Got eyes on the compound.</i>
<i>Moving in.</i>

03:20.267 --> 03:21.767
Move, move, move,
move, move, move.

03:21.769 --> 03:24.803
(commander shouts)
I have plantar fasciitis.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.505
Go.
All right.

03:27.874 --> 03:30.375
Happy: I designed the
breach-device for a hard torque,

03:30.377 --> 03:32.311
So put your back into it.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.750
(all shouting)

03:44.390 --> 03:45.657
Man (over speaker):
Down, down! Get down!

03:45.659 --> 03:47.559
Commander:
Come on, smacks. Move!

03:47.561 --> 03:50.662
Walter: All right. Sylvester,
you take the right.

03:50.664 --> 03:51.830
Commander: Faster than that!
Let's go, boys!

03:51.832 --> 03:53.932
Yeah, okay.
Are you in?

03:53.934 --> 03:57.669
Walter, there is encryption
at the firmware level.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.738
Damn it. This thing's
in arabic-sudanese unicode.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.707
I'm panicking!
I-I-I'm panicking!

04:01.709 --> 04:03.809
Commander: We don't have
time for this!
(sighs) okay, okay, okay, okay.

04:03.811 --> 04:05.310
Let's go, smacks! Come on!
Okay, we'll adapt.

04:05.312 --> 04:06.645
Perimeter breach!
15 seconds!

04:06.647 --> 04:08.013
I'm done.
I can't concentrate.

04:08.015 --> 04:10.282
I can't do this.
I-I got you, buddy. I got ya.

04:12.352 --> 04:13.785
Three seconds! You hear me?!

04:16.289 --> 04:17.389
I got the file.

04:17.391 --> 04:18.624
I got the file.
Okay.

04:18.626 --> 04:19.625
Okay.
Okay.
Commander: We're overdue!

04:19.627 --> 04:20.826
Come on! Go, go, go...!

04:20.828 --> 04:22.494
All right! All right,
where are we going?

04:22.496 --> 04:24.796
Where are we going?
Go straight! Go!

04:26.266 --> 04:27.933
Oh, god.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.837
I'm so sorry, walter.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.939
They're captured.

04:35.842 --> 04:38.043
What's with the full contact,
agent gallo?

04:42.816 --> 04:45.917
Man: All right!
Break it up, break it up!

04:45.919 --> 04:48.487
Merrick:
This is meant to impress me.

04:48.489 --> 04:49.788
Your human calculator froze.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.858
Your engineer has no concept
of following orders.

04:52.860 --> 04:53.825
And your shrink--

04:53.827 --> 04:55.060
I don't know
where to begin.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.862
You can start by being nicer.

04:56.864 --> 04:59.931
We were doing fine until
that jarhead got handsy.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.900
Where'd he touch you,
exactly?

05:01.902 --> 05:03.502
Guys, uh...
Director merrick...

05:03.504 --> 05:05.037
(clears throat)
...The, uh, marines

05:05.039 --> 05:09.408
Talking smack in the humvee
caused a distraction.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.843
Questioning our entry point
cost us time.

05:11.845 --> 05:12.911
26 seconds.

05:12.913 --> 05:13.945
To be exact.

05:13.947 --> 05:16.515
Their approach slowed us down.

05:17.850 --> 05:21.486
The purpose of this exercise
was to see

05:21.488 --> 05:22.854
If your purported
group of geniuses

05:22.856 --> 05:26.692
Could contribute to a high-end
military operation.

05:26.694 --> 05:29.861
I have seen nothing that makes
me believe that that's possible.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.396
And I'm starting
to wonder

05:31.398 --> 05:33.432
If funding this group
was a mistake.

05:33.434 --> 05:36.735
They have no further duties
until you hear from me.

05:41.407 --> 05:43.909
Ralph, we talked about this.

05:43.911 --> 05:44.976
Going to school is your job.

05:44.978 --> 05:46.912
You need to go.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.981
I'm still nervous about my new
job, but I need to go, too.

05:49.983 --> 05:55.020
Be determined to have
a great day and you will.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.723
And do you know what
I see over there?

05:57.725 --> 05:59.358
I see that little
boy wearing a t-shirt

05:59.360 --> 06:02.094
From l.A. Science
and cultural center.

06:02.096 --> 06:03.962
You love that place.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.931
I'd call that
an ice breaker, right?

06:07.800 --> 06:09.868
You're gonna be okay.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.036
Are you sure?

06:11.038 --> 06:12.104
Mm-hmm.

06:12.905 --> 06:15.073
Okay. Go.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.075
I love you.

06:18.044 --> 06:21.012
(school bell rings)

06:28.388 --> 06:29.921
(cell phone rings)

06:29.923 --> 06:31.156
Hey.

06:31.158 --> 06:32.491
How'd it go?

06:32.493 --> 06:33.592
For a government
endeavor?

06:33.594 --> 06:35.460
About how
you'd expect.

06:35.462 --> 06:37.863
Time for me to get
chewed out again.

06:37.865 --> 06:39.431
Yes, sir.
Director merrick.

06:39.433 --> 06:40.832
Oh, okay.

06:40.834 --> 06:44.469
Uh... I-I brought bagels
from kovelsky's on the corner.

06:44.471 --> 06:45.904
You're not
a waitress, paige.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.839
Though you may
be again soon,

06:47.841 --> 06:50.942
If we don't iron out our issues.

06:50.944 --> 06:53.011
The training
mission report.

06:58.117 --> 07:00.185
Paige:
She hit a marine?

07:00.187 --> 07:02.421
Yeah, this was our chance
to prove ourselves,

07:02.423 --> 07:04.022
And we end up, uh,

07:04.024 --> 07:06.091
Self-destructing
like we always do.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.460
What... What can I do?

07:08.462 --> 07:10.796
Find a way to fix us.

07:19.739 --> 07:21.106
Hey, happy.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.642
I appreciate what you're doing,

07:23.644 --> 07:26.745
But I just need
to settle down first.

07:26.747 --> 07:28.580
Check in with me Saturday.

07:28.582 --> 07:32.017
Toby: <i>You still don't</i>
<i>know us that well.</i>

07:32.019 --> 07:35.086
Happy suffers from hostility
and anger dissonance syndrome.

07:35.088 --> 07:37.055
Sylvester's anxiety, ocd,

07:37.057 --> 07:38.924
And more phobias
than you shake a stick at.

07:38.926 --> 07:42.894
Walter is textbook
intellectualmegolomania

07:42.896 --> 07:45.030
And anti-obedience
syndrome.

07:45.032 --> 07:47.532
That should be fun to see
how that plays out with cabe.

07:47.534 --> 07:49.801
Me? I am a narcissist

07:49.803 --> 07:52.003
With a slight dusting
of addiction tendencies.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.072
So, welcome aboard.

07:58.611 --> 08:01.513
â™ª here I am

08:01.515 --> 08:04.216
â™ª rock you like a hurricane...

08:04.218 --> 08:06.151
(song clicks into headphones)
yeah!

08:06.153 --> 08:07.953
(yelling):
The scorpions!

08:07.955 --> 08:09.554
It's our theme song!

08:11.491 --> 08:14.125
Is this how ralph feels,
being boxed out by other kids?

08:14.127 --> 08:17.496
You just need a little
more time to fit in.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.231
You'll be fine.

08:19.233 --> 08:20.699
And so will ralph.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.901
What is happening?

08:22.903 --> 08:24.970
Our wireless is down.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.137
How on earth is
our wireless down?

08:26.139 --> 08:28.173
That call from merrick
was about a bomb.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.908
Took out a law firm
at one wilton.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.610
Homeland responds
to all bombings.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.712
The big commercial building
down by sixth?

08:33.714 --> 08:37.115
Took out the law firm
and the basement beneath it.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.250
Six folks in intensive care.

08:38.252 --> 08:39.551
Can we tag along?

08:39.553 --> 08:41.686
Merrick has you on ice.

08:48.060 --> 08:49.027
One wilton.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.095
One wilton.

08:52.098 --> 08:55.700
They may have a problem a lot
bigger than a lawyer's office.

09:06.279 --> 09:07.913
Man: So, it was
a big blast,

09:07.915 --> 09:09.781
But they weren't trying
to take out the building.

09:09.783 --> 09:10.849
Just the law firm.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.152
Mark brown, family law.

09:14.154 --> 09:17.022
Pretty drastic step
to settle a custody dispute.

09:17.024 --> 09:19.624
Lapd said the lawyer found
a note on his door.

09:19.626 --> 09:21.660
"you ruined my life,
hope I ruined yours."

09:21.662 --> 09:24.162
Said he's assessing
collateral damage...

09:24.164 --> 09:27.666
...The destroyed internet
equipment in the basement.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.200
Showed me an fsg badge.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.602
I've never seen one before.

09:32.138 --> 09:34.005
Cabe gallo,
homeland security.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.974
Agent thomas keeler.
Fsg.

09:35.976 --> 09:38.243
Didn't know you guys
operated out in the open.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.611
Doesn't your
jurisdiction only cover

09:39.613 --> 09:41.079
Online communications
and surveillance?

09:41.081 --> 09:42.347
And when the
internet goes down,

09:42.349 --> 09:44.215
We'd like it back up
and running asap.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.917
Walter:
Cabe.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.118
Keeler: Who's contaminating
my crime scene?

09:47.120 --> 09:49.321
I think this is
an act of terrorism.

09:49.323 --> 09:50.322
Friends of yours?

09:50.324 --> 09:52.190
Independent contractors.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.191
(cell phone rings)

09:53.193 --> 09:55.093
Excuse me.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.062
Why are you here?

09:57.064 --> 09:59.297
That's agent thomas keeler,

09:59.299 --> 10:00.799
Federal
surveillance group.

10:00.801 --> 10:03.702
They analyze all domestic data
and communications

10:03.704 --> 10:05.236
For security purposes.
Toby (coughing): That's
unconstitutional.

10:06.839 --> 10:09.908
Their agency has a direct line
to merrick, the joint chiefs,

10:09.910 --> 10:11.242
The president.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.044
Any of them hear shouting
about terrorism...

10:13.046 --> 10:15.814
This intentionally
nondescript building

10:15.816 --> 10:19.017
Houses the hard cables
that support internet service

10:19.019 --> 10:20.218
Throughout the southwest.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.987
That right there is
what's left of them.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.688
There was a note left
on the lawyer's door.

10:23.690 --> 10:27.692
If the bomber was targeting the
lawyer over something emotional,

10:27.694 --> 10:29.160
Divorce or child custody,

10:29.162 --> 10:31.029
The killing mechanism
would have been intimate--

10:31.031 --> 10:32.897
Stabbing or strangulation.

10:32.899 --> 10:35.667
Structurally, you'd put the
explosive in that light fixture.

10:35.669 --> 10:37.869
Take the whole office out
instead of just a section.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.838
Whoever did this had to know
that there was

10:39.840 --> 10:41.740
A seven-millimeter
fiber trunk cable

10:41.742 --> 10:44.275
In the air vent so they could
wedge a bomb behind.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.277
That's the vent configuration
if everything is up to code.

10:46.279 --> 10:48.279
Normally, there's no place
to even plant an explosive.

10:48.281 --> 10:50.148
I worked
in the building commission

10:50.150 --> 10:51.916
For a day until I got fired

10:51.918 --> 10:54.285
For spilling some hand sanitizer
on some blueprints.

10:54.287 --> 10:56.254
With the web down

10:56.256 --> 10:58.823
Between here and scottsdale,
everything,

10:58.825 --> 11:01.826
From banking to emergency
services is affected.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.028
No access to cash.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.363
Traffic will grind
to a standstill by night.

11:05.365 --> 11:08.266
Even the dwp runs online,
and in less than a week,

11:08.268 --> 11:09.768
Fresh water goes away.

11:09.770 --> 11:12.303
This is about more than
just people losing e-mail.

11:12.305 --> 11:13.371
Keeler:
He's right about that.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.806
If you let us help,

11:14.808 --> 11:16.174
We can eventually

11:16.176 --> 11:17.342
Restore full service.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.677
In the meantime,

11:18.679 --> 11:20.311
We can help catch this bomber.

11:20.313 --> 11:21.846
Keeler:
Who exactly are

11:21.848 --> 11:24.282
These independent contractors
of yours?

11:24.284 --> 11:26.317
They're a team of
high-iq personnel

11:26.319 --> 11:27.752
That I've been working with.

11:27.754 --> 11:30.689
Give me a second.

11:30.691 --> 11:34.192
You're trying to make up
for blowing it earlier,

11:34.194 --> 11:36.261
But you guys are still
brand-new at this.

11:36.263 --> 11:38.463
You screw it up like
you did this morning,

11:38.465 --> 11:41.466
It's over for all of us.

11:41.468 --> 11:42.801
You.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.335
You need to keep
these guys in check.

11:44.337 --> 11:45.704
That's your job.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.772
Capisce?

11:48.708 --> 11:50.408
Be determined
to have a great day,

11:50.410 --> 11:52.477
And you will.

12:03.355 --> 12:05.457
The bombing in downtown l.A.

12:05.459 --> 12:07.092
Continues to have
ripple effects.

12:07.094 --> 12:09.894
Jerry dowdell reports live
from olympic and la brea.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.963
Security footage
almost set up.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.932
All right, well, if that's the
best you can do, we'll take it.

12:13.934 --> 12:16.868
Happy, a 2000 series
aggregation router

12:16.870 --> 12:18.837
Is being overnighted
from berlin.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.138
Can we get it sooner?

12:20.140 --> 12:21.973
We're not buying a mouse pad.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.975
Walter:
No, it's high-end product
only made in germany.

12:23.977 --> 12:25.810
So we get it installed tomorrow.

12:25.812 --> 12:27.879
Internet's up;
everything is back to normal.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.481
Far from it in the meantime.

12:29.483 --> 12:31.416
Traffic lights are not working,

12:31.418 --> 12:33.284
Causing near gridlock.

12:33.286 --> 12:36.488
And now reports
of a train crossing malfunction

12:36.490 --> 12:39.224
In moore park that's resulted
in the death of two pedestrians.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.492
Agent gallo,

12:40.494 --> 12:42.293
I have a psychotic
bomber to catch,

12:42.295 --> 12:43.795
And I don't have all day.

12:43.797 --> 12:45.130
Happy:
Surveillance footage is ready.

12:45.132 --> 12:46.498
Walter:
All right, happy, can you run

12:46.500 --> 12:48.133
The films simultaneously?

12:48.135 --> 12:49.934
So, first thing

12:49.936 --> 12:52.871
We're gonna do is run
a gaussian filter algorithm.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.272
That way, you get rid
of all the film

12:54.274 --> 12:55.907
Where nothing moves.

12:55.909 --> 12:57.942
It's a big problem with
surveillance footage.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.210
There. We just cut down

12:59.212 --> 13:02.213
The number of hours
to search by 80%.

13:02.215 --> 13:03.548
Where did you get
this "goss-ian..."

13:03.550 --> 13:04.883
Gaussian.

13:05.851 --> 13:08.319
...Gaussian algorithm thing?

13:08.321 --> 13:10.054
Photoshop. Toby, you're up.

13:10.056 --> 13:11.990
We're gonna get a little
un-pc up in here.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.092
Traditional bomber profile
means we lose

13:14.094 --> 13:15.059
Asians

13:15.061 --> 13:16.361
And latinos.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.363
Cut anyone over 60 and under 12.

13:18.365 --> 13:21.065
That's not how this software
is meant to operate.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.233
Explosives are traditionally
a boys' club,

13:22.235 --> 13:24.002
So let's lose the women

13:24.004 --> 13:27.071
And anyone not wearing
a hat or sunglasses.

13:27.073 --> 13:29.374
All right, now who's ready
for a little hustle and flow?

13:29.376 --> 13:30.475
What's that?

13:30.477 --> 13:31.976
Flow dynamics,
study of herd think.

13:31.978 --> 13:35.013
When one gazelle's ears perk up,
so do all the others,

13:35.015 --> 13:36.114
Then they all run
from the cheetah

13:36.116 --> 13:37.315
With the same urgency.

13:37.317 --> 13:41.252
That guy in the hat
and sunglasses.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.554
White male, 30s,

13:42.556 --> 13:46.558
See, he's calm, 'cause he knows
no other bombs are gonna go off.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.259
Run him through the program.

13:48.261 --> 13:51.095
I did. It's no match.

13:51.097 --> 13:53.264
Well, we'll take it
back to the fsg lab.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.432
We can clarify

13:54.434 --> 13:55.967
The photo.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.502
You know,
your software is decent,

13:57.504 --> 13:58.970
But it relies on three-point

13:58.972 --> 14:00.205
Bone structure ratio,

14:00.207 --> 14:02.006
And that's pretty hard
to compute

14:02.008 --> 14:06.444
How do you know so much about
top-secret government software?

14:06.446 --> 14:08.980
I may know someone
who hacked into it.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.515
Be that as it may,

14:10.517 --> 14:13.017
I'll rely on my technology.

14:13.019 --> 14:15.220
Cabe,

14:15.222 --> 14:16.287
Let's go,

14:16.289 --> 14:18.056
But I'm done
with your friends.

14:18.058 --> 14:20.391
Pump your brakes before you
say something brilliant.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.994
Walter:
The truth is

14:22.996 --> 14:24.529
His $80 million software

14:24.531 --> 14:27.398
Was beaten by a hat
and sunglasses.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.901
What did we say earlier
about a chain of command?

14:29.903 --> 14:31.369
You need to follow it.

14:31.371 --> 14:32.604
Okay.

14:35.007 --> 14:37.008
This is illogical.

14:37.010 --> 14:39.110
We have a much better chance
of finding that bomber

14:39.112 --> 14:40.111
Than cabe does.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.179
Okay, let's go.

14:41.181 --> 14:42.947
That's not what cabe wants.

14:42.949 --> 14:45.183
All right, the bottom line is

14:45.185 --> 14:46.951
Cabe wants this team to work,

14:46.953 --> 14:48.620
So if we find the guy
that everyone's looking for,

14:48.622 --> 14:51.055
About director merrick
shutting us down again.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.557
All right?

14:52.559 --> 14:54.659
All right.

14:57.096 --> 15:00.398
The bomber could have had
a car waiting for him,

15:00.400 --> 15:03.234
But a co-conspirator, it
increases the odds of capture.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.969
Now there's a bus
stop a street over,

15:04.971 --> 15:06.938
But that gives people too
much time to see his face.

15:06.940 --> 15:10.208
The plaza was full
of people fleeing.

15:10.210 --> 15:13.077
I mean, it was far too crowded
for anybody to even get through.

15:13.079 --> 15:16.514
Normal mathematicians
run probabilities,

15:16.516 --> 15:18.650
The odds of a given set
of facts taking place.

15:18.652 --> 15:22.186
Sylvester's mind runs
all potentialities, the odds

15:22.188 --> 15:23.988
Of almost any possible scenario
taking place.

15:23.990 --> 15:25.123
That's incredible.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.958
That's sylvester.
That's sylvester.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.192
Bargain nation. Okay, so,

15:28.194 --> 15:29.994
He enters in the chaos.

15:29.996 --> 15:31.229
He walks to the back,

15:31.231 --> 15:32.697
And he exits
out the loading dock.

15:32.699 --> 15:35.066
Now he's three blocks away
with little public exposure.

15:35.068 --> 15:36.367
That is his best play.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.169
That's why
we don't wait for cabe.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.704
All right, we're gonna
do this ourselves.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.372
Those stores take
great close-ups

15:41.374 --> 15:42.707
When you go in
to prevent shoplifters.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.075
They'll have him on camera.

15:44.077 --> 15:46.010
Why would they
give us a photo?

15:46.012 --> 15:47.145
Because I lifted cabe's badge.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.446
Oh, toby.
Oh, please.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.248
The way you two were fighting
this morning,

15:50.250 --> 15:52.083
I figured we would have
gone rogue hours ago.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.217
You should thank me

15:53.219 --> 15:55.420
For anticipating.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.355
Now we have a close-up
of our bomber.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.257
That's still doesn't help us.

15:59.259 --> 16:00.591
Hold on.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.694
Hey, dude,
are you done with that?

16:02.696 --> 16:05.029
Okay, you look pretty done
with that.
Whoa!

16:05.031 --> 16:07.231
Give me the photo.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.133
This guy's got
something to offer.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.501
Lens effect.

16:10.503 --> 16:12.603
Convex bottle
and water to refract.

16:12.605 --> 16:15.606
His key chain's a bottle opener
with something on it.

16:16.542 --> 16:18.609
Is that a turtle
in a racing helmet?

16:18.611 --> 16:21.479
They have turtle races
on Saturday nights.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.613
I lost four grand there.

16:22.615 --> 16:23.748
Word to the wise,

16:23.750 --> 16:25.283
Don't bet
on yertle mcquickshell.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.352
She's misnamed.

16:28.287 --> 16:29.454
What?

16:40.766 --> 16:42.333
Hey.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.601
We're, uh, looking for someone

16:43.603 --> 16:45.470
Who might be one
of your customers.

16:45.472 --> 16:46.571
You know the guy?

16:46.573 --> 16:48.306
My shifts vary.

16:48.308 --> 16:52.777
Really? Because you stop cutting
lemon wedges when you answered.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.145
You want to know why?

16:54.147 --> 16:55.546
Because I had enough?

16:55.548 --> 16:57.715
No, that's clearly
not enough lemon wedges.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.118
Of your brain that handles
the details

17:00.120 --> 17:02.286
Of small tasks
like cutting lemon wedges

17:02.288 --> 17:04.222
Also engages when someone's
creating lies.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.024
"I'm in and out.
My shifts vary," and so on.

17:06.026 --> 17:08.526
I'm assuming you're lying
because you're on parole

17:08.528 --> 17:10.495
Like the majority of bartenders
working the day shift.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.530
Your no-snitching criminal code
is only gonna result

17:12.532 --> 17:13.698
In trouble that you don't want.

17:13.700 --> 17:17.301
Hey, aren't you the guy who lost
a fortune on that turtle?

17:19.071 --> 17:20.338
What I do when I'm off-duty

17:20.340 --> 17:22.073
Is my business.

17:22.075 --> 17:23.674
The fact that you're lying means
you know this guy

17:23.676 --> 17:25.510
Or where in town
he might lay his head.

17:25.512 --> 17:28.513
Or the next thing
I'm gonna pull out of my hat

17:28.515 --> 17:30.181
Is gonna be my cuffs.
You got it, dish rag?

17:30.183 --> 17:32.717
I know a waitress
he took home one night.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.552
I'll make a call.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.154
You know you're not a cop.

17:36.156 --> 17:39.257
You're a cop if you believe
you're a cop.

17:41.193 --> 17:43.828
Walter:
<i>Something's bothering you.</i>

17:43.830 --> 17:47.532
Yes, walter, we're outside the
house of a possible terrorist.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.067
You guys might not be
the best people

17:49.069 --> 17:50.401
To handle a situation
like this.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.203
And if I'm going to translate
situations for you

17:52.205 --> 17:53.604
Like you asked me to,

17:53.606 --> 17:55.206
I think you're making
a huge mistake.

17:55.208 --> 17:58.476
I will do it for sure when
we know the guy's in there.

17:58.478 --> 17:59.777
Hold on

17:59.779 --> 18:02.213
A second.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.315
I have a way to find out
if he's in there.

18:04.317 --> 18:05.450
Oh!

18:05.452 --> 18:06.784
(phone rings)
oh, I like this idea.

18:06.786 --> 18:07.785
Be right back!

18:07.787 --> 18:09.720
That's my money.
Paige: Yes?

18:09.722 --> 18:11.856
Hi, ralph.
How are you, sweetie?

18:11.858 --> 18:14.292
Yeah, okay,
I know there's no internet,

18:14.294 --> 18:17.862
But maybe spend recess outside
and play with the other kids.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.564
Can you give me
the phone, please?

18:19.566 --> 18:22.400
Ralph occupy yourself
with this.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.268
I have a riddle
for you to figure out.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.704
You can tell your mom the answer
at the end of the day.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.840
So, what kind of punch

18:28.842 --> 18:29.841
Does a jellyfish like?

18:29.843 --> 18:31.309
You got it? Okay, cool.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.678
All right, hold on one second.
Any dreams you have

18:33.680 --> 18:36.547
Of him making a team
or being in student council,

18:36.549 --> 18:38.783
It's just, uh, not gonna happen.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.652
I thought you told me
he'd eventually fit in.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.187
No, he will, just not at school.

18:43.189 --> 18:44.856
Ralph? Excuse me.

18:44.858 --> 18:47.125
Hey.

18:48.694 --> 18:50.628
She's very sweet.
I know you think she can help,

18:50.630 --> 18:52.330
But purely from
an analytical point of view,

18:52.332 --> 18:53.564
What exactly
is her purpose here?

18:53.566 --> 18:54.632
Oh, take it easy.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.334
Sylvester, come on,
help me out here.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.402
She's pretty.

19:00.739 --> 19:02.740
Walter: Do I need to
remind you guys that

19:02.742 --> 19:05.910
To be her stand-in at
fabrication competitions

19:05.912 --> 19:07.178
Because she can't
stand to be judged?

19:07.180 --> 19:09.380
When I first met you,

19:09.382 --> 19:12.316
You were about to get beaten
by an atlantic city pit boss,

19:12.318 --> 19:14.785
And do we even need to discuss
the state that you were in?

19:14.787 --> 19:16.320
It wasn't pleasant.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.322
I-I saw something in you guys.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.490
I see something in her.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.492
She'll thrive at this job.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.894
You just,
you have to trust me.

19:22.896 --> 19:24.328
Hold this.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.730
I need a parabola.

19:25.732 --> 19:27.598
Give me that tape!

19:27.600 --> 19:29.167
Walter:
That's the only thing

19:29.169 --> 19:30.835
Holding my seat together.
I need the mic.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.403
Here.

19:32.405 --> 19:34.539
(groans)

19:34.541 --> 19:36.374
This umbrella is disgusting.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.876
Okay, everyone quiet.

19:41.813 --> 19:43.414
Footsteps.

19:43.416 --> 19:44.849
Paige: Walter,
you really need to call cabe.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.918
(line ringing)

19:48.320 --> 19:49.787
Hold on.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.856
Sylvester:
I think it's him.

19:51.858 --> 19:54.192
Be cool, guys.

20:03.335 --> 20:04.735
Come on!
Oh!
Happy, happy!

20:04.737 --> 20:05.836
We can nail this guy!
Happy, happy!

20:05.838 --> 20:09.507
You do a loop around the
block and make sure that he

20:09.509 --> 20:10.841
Doesn't come under the bridge.
Paige, get in with me now.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.210
Toby:
Chasing bad guys

20:12.212 --> 20:14.512
Isn't out thing.
It is now!

20:14.514 --> 20:16.414
No one will ever know
if we just don't do anything.

20:16.416 --> 20:18.249
Goddamn it.

20:22.354 --> 20:24.889
Happy: I'm right on your six,
you dumb son of a bitch!

20:27.893 --> 20:30.328
Paige: There he is.
We got him.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.563
Walter, it's a dead end.

20:32.565 --> 20:33.698
Dead end!

20:36.568 --> 20:38.369
(tires squealing)

20:38.371 --> 20:40.538
(groans)

20:41.974 --> 20:44.976
Halt! Stop!
(grunts)

20:46.745 --> 20:47.912
(tires squealing, horn honking)

20:53.018 --> 20:54.385
Paige:
There he is!

20:55.587 --> 20:56.821
Paige: Oh, my god!
He's got a gun!

20:56.823 --> 20:58.322
Walter: Aah! Get down, get down,
get down! Aah!

20:58.324 --> 20:59.957
(bus horn blares, tires screech)

21:06.932 --> 21:09.033
Oh... Oh, no...

21:10.002 --> 21:12.370
Not good.

21:22.948 --> 21:24.282
Cabe:
Blown pupil.

21:24.284 --> 21:26.651
Spinal fluid coming
out of his nose.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.052
Comatose.

21:28.054 --> 21:30.454
Well, the good news is
we found the guy.

21:30.456 --> 21:31.789
Keeler:
Really?

21:33.058 --> 21:34.859
Is that good news?

21:34.861 --> 21:37.595
'cause I thought we might want
to question our only witness,

21:37.597 --> 21:39.630
Find out his agenda.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.432
Where some more bombs might be.

21:41.434 --> 21:45.836
But we can't do that when
the guy's in a damn coma.

21:45.838 --> 21:47.872
Great job, mensa.

21:47.874 --> 21:49.006
Mensa?! Please.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.975
There are porn stars in mensa.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.977
I will write all of you up

21:52.979 --> 21:56.047
For hindering
a federal investigation.

21:56.049 --> 21:59.383
You hitched your wagon to
some real stars, here, gallo.

22:03.355 --> 22:04.989
Thank you, toby.

22:04.991 --> 22:09.560
You're going to the suspect's
house to gather evidence,

22:09.562 --> 22:13.364
If I want your help,
I'll ask you for it.

22:26.878 --> 22:28.813
You have the same look
ralph does

22:28.815 --> 22:30.548
When he can't figure
something out.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.750
(sighing):
Right. All I know is that...

22:32.752 --> 22:35.986
(clears throat) if the only
suspect dies, and we don't get

22:35.988 --> 22:41.359
Then more people could get hurt
and that would be our fault.

22:41.361 --> 22:43.661
(inhales, groans)

22:43.663 --> 22:46.364
I don't think this experiment
with cabe survives,

22:46.366 --> 22:50.835
The mentally-enabled don't
find a home this easily.

22:50.837 --> 22:53.070
It's safe for us here, you know?

22:53.072 --> 22:56.407
I overheard you and the guys
talking about me earlier...

22:56.409 --> 22:58.809
Oh, they-they didn't
mean anything by it.

22:58.811 --> 23:01.579
I don't think you guys say
things you don't mean.

23:01.581 --> 23:03.981
But I quit a job to be here.

23:03.983 --> 23:07.118
I have a kid and bills
and no other options.

23:07.120 --> 23:10.087
Now, I heard you tell them
that you believe in me-- well...

23:10.089 --> 23:13.524
I believe in you, too,
but you guys don't listen.

23:14.860 --> 23:16.160
You think
you're always right

23:16.162 --> 23:17.628
Because you are
almost always right,

23:17.630 --> 23:19.096
But if you keep
boxing me out,

23:19.098 --> 23:21.098
Like the cool kids
on the playground, then...

23:21.100 --> 23:22.867
You're correct...

23:22.869 --> 23:25.469
This won't survive.

23:42.554 --> 23:44.188
Would it buy them
any good will

23:44.190 --> 23:46.056
If I told you they
know they screwed up?

23:46.058 --> 23:47.591
Barely.

23:49.494 --> 23:52.062
Bits and pieces
from the guy's garage.

23:52.064 --> 23:53.964
Assume it's ieds.
I'll take a look.

23:53.966 --> 23:55.499
Need a hand.

23:57.068 --> 23:59.036
Bomber's computer.

23:59.038 --> 24:01.972
It has some kind of
security setup.

24:01.974 --> 24:03.874
The only reason
we're getting a shot at this,

24:03.876 --> 24:06.043
Is 'cause keeler's men couldn't
get through the firewall.

24:06.045 --> 24:09.447
Because the guy's fingerprints
aren't in the system,

24:09.449 --> 24:11.215
And all five of his aliases
have come up empty.

24:11.217 --> 24:13.017
All right, I'll get into it.

24:19.991 --> 24:21.492
(typing rapidly)

24:21.494 --> 24:22.960
Craftsmanship on the wiring

24:22.962 --> 24:25.229
Indicates u.S.
Special forces training.

24:25.231 --> 24:27.898
But there's only one reason
to have these other pieces.

24:27.900 --> 24:32.236
And these things here...
Are leftover sequencers.

24:32.238 --> 24:36.240
But they were all set for
some time within the half hour,

24:36.242 --> 24:39.210
All coordinated via local
frequency transmitters.

24:39.212 --> 24:41.712
And what does that mean?

24:41.714 --> 24:42.980
There are more bombs.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.615
But they were all
supposed to go off

24:44.617 --> 24:46.083
In l.A. At the same time.

24:46.085 --> 24:49.086
I think the bomb
at one wilton malfunctioned

24:49.088 --> 24:50.621
And went off early,
and more bombs

24:50.623 --> 24:52.189
Are coming down the pike
real soon.

24:52.191 --> 24:54.158
You think or you know?

24:54.160 --> 24:57.127
(multiple explosions thundering)

24:57.129 --> 24:58.262
I know.

25:02.167 --> 25:05.236
(emergency sirens wailing)

25:19.084 --> 25:22.586
He hit a mall, a radio tower
and an armored car.

25:22.588 --> 25:23.921
I don't get it.

25:23.923 --> 25:26.190
Um, guys...
I've been to every one
of these sights,

25:26.192 --> 25:28.158
And I still don't see a pattern.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.894
Guys, maybe it isn't meant...
See, it's terrorism
without focus,

25:29.896 --> 25:34.198
We're trying to figure
something out.
Don't interrupt me, toby.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.067
The armored truck
wasn't the target.

25:37.069 --> 25:39.637
I was a cashier
at a pic 'n save.

25:39.639 --> 25:41.272
When the truck shows up
depends on how much

25:41.274 --> 25:43.173
Extra cash double-coupon
wednesdays brings in.

25:43.175 --> 25:45.042
So it shows up at different
times each week.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.610
There's no way to plan
bombing something

25:46.612 --> 25:48.045
If you don't know
when it'll be there.

25:48.047 --> 25:50.648
So maybe he put the bomb
in the garbage can

25:50.650 --> 25:52.683
To take out that building,
not the truck.

25:53.885 --> 25:55.753
She might be right.

25:57.556 --> 25:58.923
Remember when I said
you'd thrive?

25:58.925 --> 26:01.659
Feels good
being right again.

26:01.661 --> 26:03.594
Cabe:
So if the building was a target,

26:03.596 --> 26:05.329
The next logical question
is "why?"

26:05.331 --> 26:07.798
Well, it has to be some business
in that building, right?

26:07.800 --> 26:08.866
I'm gonna call information.

26:08.868 --> 26:09.934
That's a good idea.

26:09.936 --> 26:11.235
Oh, afterwards,
let's write on

26:11.237 --> 26:12.570
One of those zeppelins
I've heard about.

26:12.572 --> 26:14.271
Cabe:
Yeah, hi.

26:14.273 --> 26:18.309
My name is federal agent
cabe gallo, badge number 2835.

26:18.311 --> 26:19.777
I want to get a rundown

26:19.779 --> 26:22.246
On all the numbers running
from 939 conklin.

26:22.248 --> 26:24.148
Thank you.

26:25.083 --> 26:26.283
Before computers,

26:26.285 --> 26:29.320
People had to actually
talk to each other.

26:30.755 --> 26:32.823
Yeah, I'm ready.

26:33.959 --> 26:35.793
Casperson film and print.

26:35.795 --> 26:38.729
Lynchfield printing...
Greytech.

26:38.731 --> 26:41.832
Greytech-- that's it.
That's it.
Thank you for your help.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.367
Greytech specialize
in slow storage servers,

26:43.369 --> 26:47.237
Places that hold old data
that's rarely accessed on-line,

26:47.239 --> 26:49.840
Like, uh... Five-year-
old bank statements...

26:49.842 --> 26:52.710
So he bombed the internet hub
and then a slow server but...

26:52.712 --> 26:53.978
That doesn't explain
the other targets.

26:53.980 --> 26:55.746
They're red herrings.

26:55.748 --> 26:57.748
The bomber wanted
his attacks

26:57.750 --> 26:59.283
To appear random,
to hide his real motive.

26:59.285 --> 27:00.351
But what is it?

27:00.353 --> 27:02.686
He's taking out sites where...

27:02.688 --> 27:04.288
Data would be stored long-term

27:04.290 --> 27:06.624
And the ability to
distribute it on-line,

27:06.626 --> 27:07.858
So maybe the bomber's
got a secret

27:07.860 --> 27:09.259
He doesn't want getting out

27:09.261 --> 27:11.695
And he's willing to blow up
the city to erase it.

27:12.897 --> 27:15.799
Reporter: There's an increasing
sense of panic in the city.

27:15.801 --> 27:17.701
Traffic signals
are still sporadic.

27:17.703 --> 27:19.703
And now, overloading
electrical transformers

27:19.705 --> 27:22.006
Have erupted into flames,

27:22.008 --> 27:24.742
Igniting several homes
and a brush fire.

27:24.744 --> 27:26.410
Director merrick's
all over my ass

27:26.412 --> 27:28.045
Because the damn city's
falling apart.

27:29.147 --> 27:30.981
I hope to god
you're making progress

27:30.983 --> 27:32.082
With the bomber's computer.

27:32.084 --> 27:33.250
Oh, I am.

27:33.252 --> 27:34.852
It shows a failed attempt

27:34.854 --> 27:36.854
To hack into a file
at a slow server.

27:36.856 --> 27:38.922
Now, the file belonged
to an e-mail account

27:38.924 --> 27:40.724
By the name of
frank turner.

27:40.726 --> 27:42.793
Frank turner died
two weeks ago.

27:42.795 --> 27:43.861
I printed out
this article for you.

27:43.863 --> 27:45.963
A hit and run?

27:45.965 --> 27:49.233
The car that actually killed
him was never even found.

27:49.235 --> 27:51.135
But if someone is willing
to blow up buildings

27:51.137 --> 27:55.105
It has to contain something
very incriminating.

27:55.107 --> 27:56.807
On someone very important.

27:56.809 --> 27:58.442
But how in the hell
do you erase a file

27:58.444 --> 27:59.977
Once it's on the web?

27:59.979 --> 28:01.845
Oh, it can be done.

28:03.782 --> 28:04.782
You got it, right?

28:04.784 --> 28:05.849
Right.

28:05.851 --> 28:07.885
Okay. Yeah.

28:10.689 --> 28:14.825
First, you'd need to destroy
the means of distribution.

28:14.827 --> 28:17.127
He did that when he blew up
the building this morning.

28:17.129 --> 28:18.729
Next...
You need to get rid

28:18.731 --> 28:20.297
Of where it's stored--
the slow server.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.933
He did that when he blew up
greytech.

28:22.935 --> 28:25.469
Now, if you want to get
really anal about it,

28:25.471 --> 28:27.738
You take out the router hub.
What's that?

28:27.740 --> 28:28.872
Most people
don't know this,

28:28.874 --> 28:30.307
But when you send
a file on-line,

28:30.309 --> 28:31.942
It sits at a small router

28:31.944 --> 28:34.745
Before moving on
to a slow sever.

28:34.747 --> 28:37.881
But even as it goes,
it leaves a copy of itself.

28:37.883 --> 28:39.249
A shadow file.

28:39.251 --> 28:40.884
And that remains
for a few weeks,

28:40.886 --> 28:42.720
And then... (snaps fingers)
disappears.

28:42.722 --> 28:46.790
Now, the problem is there's
thousands of router hubs,

28:46.792 --> 28:49.093
But millions of files
going in.

28:49.095 --> 28:51.929
So we're tracing
frank turner's ip address,

28:51.931 --> 28:54.865
Trying to track down
the right router hub.

28:54.867 --> 28:56.734
It's like looking for
a needle in a haystack.

28:56.736 --> 28:59.069
Toby: I got it.
And it's actually

28:59.071 --> 29:01.939
More like trying to find
a needle in a pile of needles.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.807
Ladies and gentlemen,

29:03.809 --> 29:04.875
Who wants to sew?

29:04.877 --> 29:06.477
Because I just found
that needle.

29:06.479 --> 29:08.145
Frank turner's ip address leads

29:08.147 --> 29:09.980
To a router hub
in sunny tarzana.

29:09.982 --> 29:11.014
Come on, follow me.

29:11.016 --> 29:12.449
I just saved
a whole bunch of people.

29:12.451 --> 29:13.884
We find what's
in that e-mail,

29:13.886 --> 29:15.452
We'll know who wants
to destroy it.

29:22.293 --> 29:24.928
Exactly what
are you looking for?

29:24.930 --> 29:26.196
If we explained it to you,

29:26.198 --> 29:27.865
Your mind would melt
into your socks.

29:27.867 --> 29:29.133
It's official
government business.

29:29.135 --> 29:31.301
Just... Give us
some room.

29:33.071 --> 29:35.939
Normals, huh?

29:35.941 --> 29:37.207
No offense.

29:37.209 --> 29:38.308
None taken.

29:38.310 --> 29:39.343
Got it.

29:39.345 --> 29:41.345
E-mail from frank turner

29:41.347 --> 29:42.980
To a heavily encrypted account.

29:46.117 --> 29:48.018
Whoa.

29:49.454 --> 29:50.821
All right,
"my name is frank turner.

29:50.823 --> 29:53.056
I was a member of fsg..."

29:53.058 --> 29:55.092
The agency agent keeler's with.

29:55.094 --> 29:57.995
Walter: "in violation of
u.S. And international law,

29:57.997 --> 30:01.131
"fsg, under agent thomas keeler

30:01.133 --> 30:02.866
"has been spying on
the white house,

30:02.868 --> 30:04.468
The state department..."
stop right there.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.970
So keeler found out about this,
took turner out,

30:06.972 --> 30:08.939
And then went
after that data.

30:08.941 --> 30:11.041
Just copy it onto the drive.

30:11.043 --> 30:13.877
I'll get it to the doj,
get a warrant to arrest keeler.

30:13.879 --> 30:17.181
He brought you in just
to keep an eye on you.

30:17.183 --> 30:19.049
Keeler hired the bomber?
A black ops ghost,

30:19.051 --> 30:20.851
Who couldn't be
traced back to him.

30:20.853 --> 30:22.553
Sylvester:
Here's the file, cabe.

30:22.555 --> 30:25.989
Fsg's a black budget
funded operation.

30:25.991 --> 30:28.892
They recruit out of the cia
and the special forces.

30:28.894 --> 30:31.929
(distant beeping)
they're plugged in
with no oversight.

30:33.298 --> 30:34.331
Happy, what are you doing?

30:34.333 --> 30:35.933
I just heard something.

30:35.935 --> 30:37.601
What are you...?
Happy?

30:42.140 --> 30:43.974
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

30:43.976 --> 30:47.144
Hey, hey, hey...
...Just be careful, okay?

30:47.146 --> 30:48.212
Where's she going?

30:56.955 --> 31:00.057
(steady beeping)

31:06.164 --> 31:09.066
Guys, big problem.

31:11.069 --> 31:14.071
(beeping continues)

31:14.073 --> 31:15.405
It's mean-looking.

31:15.407 --> 31:16.940
Enough plastique
for this building

31:16.942 --> 31:18.342
And the one next door.

31:18.344 --> 31:20.611
Uh, based on the speed
of the blinking light,

31:20.613 --> 31:22.045
And the acceleration
of the beep,

31:22.047 --> 31:24.014
I would say that
we have approximately

31:24.016 --> 31:25.582
Five minutes and
31 seconds.

31:25.584 --> 31:28.151
I thought said there's no chance
he'd choose this building.

31:28.153 --> 31:29.486
(sylvester counting down)
he didn't.

31:29.488 --> 31:31.021
There are no sequencers
on this device.

31:31.023 --> 31:33.957
Did someone tell keeler
we were going to be here?

31:33.959 --> 31:35.459
I told merrick.

31:35.461 --> 31:36.927
Yeah, who kept the fsg
in the loop

31:36.929 --> 31:37.961
Because he doesn't trust us.

31:37.963 --> 31:41.131
There's no time to call in
the bomb squad.

31:41.133 --> 31:43.000
(sighs)

31:43.002 --> 31:45.035
All right, we're gonna
have to evacuate
the building ourselves.

31:45.037 --> 31:46.336
Have the maintenance man

31:46.338 --> 31:48.071
Pull the fire alarm.

31:48.073 --> 31:49.072
That leaves the building
20% full.

31:49.074 --> 31:51.375
All right,
then go floor to floor.

31:51.377 --> 31:52.542
But just keep an eye

31:52.544 --> 31:54.111
On time, okay?
Uh-huh.

31:54.113 --> 31:55.679
Cabe, you gotta
get that drive

31:55.681 --> 31:57.347
To the doj.
If this place goes up,

31:57.349 --> 31:59.216
It's the last existing
version of the file.

31:59.218 --> 32:01.585
Sylvester, make sure
he knows how to open it.
Happily.

32:01.587 --> 32:03.186
You're gonna need this
to get into the doj.

32:03.188 --> 32:04.554
Where'd you
get that?

32:04.556 --> 32:05.622
You dropped it.

32:13.298 --> 32:15.699
(tires squealing)

32:15.701 --> 32:18.602
Working for the government
like agent keeler?

32:18.604 --> 32:22.339
It makes it kind of hard
to trust officials.

32:22.341 --> 32:24.074
He's a rarity.

32:24.076 --> 32:26.176
There's no sense
going around

32:26.178 --> 32:28.078
Terrified that the
government's after you.

32:44.462 --> 32:47.531
(breathing hard)

32:47.533 --> 32:50.267
The file. Now.

32:58.676 --> 33:00.310
I'll put a hole
in your head.

33:00.312 --> 33:01.611
You give me
that file.

33:01.613 --> 33:03.380
Okay, you want
to get smart, huh?

33:03.382 --> 33:04.982
Cabe:
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait wait.

33:08.653 --> 33:10.220
(grunting)

33:13.591 --> 33:16.026
(siren approaching)

33:18.129 --> 33:19.162
Don't you move!

33:19.164 --> 33:20.664
Paige:
<i>Everybody needs to exit!</i>

33:20.666 --> 33:23.033
Guys, evacuate
the building!
This is not a drill!

33:23.035 --> 33:25.635
Come on, go, go go!
Everybody get out
of the building, now.

33:25.637 --> 33:28.305
You need to run!
Toby:
This is not...

33:28.307 --> 33:30.307
Happy:
I can't defuse this.

33:30.309 --> 33:34.478
Sylvester: We're down
to 3:40, 39, 38...

33:34.480 --> 33:35.679
This wiring is all jerry-rigged,

33:35.681 --> 33:37.214
Pure guerilla ied thinking.

33:37.216 --> 33:38.448
Anything could trip it.

33:38.450 --> 33:42.085
If we do run now, everyone else
left in the building is dead,

33:42.087 --> 33:43.720
So...
Any ideas?
If it were 1840,

33:43.722 --> 33:45.589
We could drop it down a well.
What about the roof?

33:45.591 --> 33:46.656
No time.

33:48.059 --> 33:49.059
Wait!

33:49.061 --> 33:50.093
Janitor supplies.

33:50.095 --> 33:52.329
Joint compound.

33:52.331 --> 33:53.597
This bomb's
gonna blow,

33:53.599 --> 33:56.166
But we can lessen
the impact.

33:56.168 --> 33:58.168
If this, uh, janitor
likes his grub salty,

33:58.170 --> 33:59.669
We might be able
to mute the bomb.

33:59.671 --> 34:01.638
Salt speeds up the
hardening process,

34:01.640 --> 34:03.573
But you gotta mix
it in thoroughly.
Ah! Ha ha!

34:03.575 --> 34:04.541
Salt packets!

34:04.543 --> 34:05.609
We're in business.

34:17.588 --> 34:19.322
Guys, hurry, hurry, hurry!

34:19.324 --> 34:20.657
Get out of
the building!

34:20.659 --> 34:23.226
Sir, get out of the building!

34:24.195 --> 34:25.595
Paige:
Toby!

34:25.597 --> 34:27.464
You're bleeding.
You're bleeding.

34:27.466 --> 34:28.665
Oh, my god.
We gotta go.

34:32.370 --> 34:33.503
Happy:
If this works,

34:33.505 --> 34:34.504
The blast will take
out the garage,

34:34.506 --> 34:35.705
But save the
building.

34:35.707 --> 34:39.276
Ah... We're down
to a minute 30.

34:41.612 --> 34:43.113
Here we go.

34:43.115 --> 34:45.582
(bomb beeping)

34:45.584 --> 34:47.617
If the salt works,

34:47.619 --> 34:49.653
It should harden
pretty quick.

34:49.655 --> 34:51.521
It'll mute the
blast enough

34:51.523 --> 34:52.789
To contain damage
to this garage.

34:52.791 --> 34:55.125
If it's not stirred
until it's hard as a rock,

34:55.127 --> 34:56.460
It won't mute
anything.

34:56.462 --> 34:59.362
Happy, you gotta go
find paige and toby.

34:59.364 --> 35:00.697
Get 'em out
of the building.

35:00.699 --> 35:01.665
You got about a minute left.

35:01.667 --> 35:02.866
I run when
you do.

35:02.868 --> 35:04.768
Do it now, okay?

35:04.770 --> 35:06.837
I'm right behind you.

35:08.172 --> 35:10.240
You better be.

35:28.693 --> 35:31.495
Happy:
We have seconds to get clear!

35:31.497 --> 35:33.730
One in front of
the other, dimwit.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.198
In half a minute,
this building goes.

35:35.200 --> 35:36.399
Paige:
Where's walter?

35:36.401 --> 35:37.400
He's coming.

35:37.402 --> 35:39.469
He promised.

35:40.505 --> 35:41.805
(bomb beeping)

35:41.807 --> 35:43.507
(walter grunts)

35:53.518 --> 35:54.684
(choking)

35:55.653 --> 35:57.187
Cabe...

35:57.189 --> 35:58.889
(grunts)

36:25.583 --> 36:28.318
(gunshots)

36:28.320 --> 36:29.686
I don't want to shoot anyone,

36:29.688 --> 36:31.221
But I will if I have to!

36:31.223 --> 36:32.889
And honestly,
I don't know

36:32.891 --> 36:34.791
Who I'd hit,
so, so please...

36:34.793 --> 36:36.493
Put the pipe down!
(gunshot)

36:41.799 --> 36:42.866
(grunts)

36:46.637 --> 36:47.804
He'll get out.

36:47.806 --> 36:49.239
He knows
the time left.

36:53.477 --> 36:56.446
(screaming)

36:56.448 --> 36:58.515
(car alarms wailing)

37:02.987 --> 37:05.255
â™ª

37:26.712 --> 37:29.713
I still don't
know what it is,
exactly, you do here.

37:29.715 --> 37:31.615
But... I'm glad
you're here.

37:31.617 --> 37:32.882
(laughs)

37:32.884 --> 37:34.951
You're welcome.

37:37.321 --> 37:39.489
You could've left him
in the building, you know.

37:39.491 --> 37:41.558
I'd be tempted.

37:43.294 --> 37:44.694
Can you get anything
from your computer?

37:44.696 --> 37:48.999
Blast destroyed
and shredded the hard drive.

37:49.001 --> 37:51.001
Thumb drive
is dust.

37:51.003 --> 37:52.802
So he erased all the evidence

37:52.804 --> 37:55.038
That could tie keeler
to these bombings.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.574
He might be in custody now,

37:57.576 --> 38:00.277
But he'll be
gone by morning.

38:00.279 --> 38:02.579
What if someone knew
that on December 17

38:02.581 --> 38:04.914
Keeler and the u.S.
Secretary of defense

38:04.916 --> 38:08.351
Had a meeting about illegal
drone strikes in pakistan

38:08.353 --> 38:11.655
And keeler recorded it
to use as blackmail?

38:11.657 --> 38:14.057
I'd say it's
admissible evidence.

38:14.059 --> 38:15.892
What-what are you
getting at, son?

38:15.894 --> 38:17.327
Sylvester was standing
over my shoulder

38:17.329 --> 38:19.663
When the unencrypted file
scrolled through.

38:19.665 --> 38:21.364
He memorized the whole thing.

38:21.366 --> 38:22.532
It was almost
30 pages, though.

38:22.534 --> 38:24.401
It only took
a second.

38:24.403 --> 38:26.703
There are a lot of
incriminating
things in there.

38:26.705 --> 38:28.538
Dirty things.

38:28.540 --> 38:30.073
You're coming
with me to homeland.

38:30.075 --> 38:32.442
We're getting what
you know down on paper.

38:32.444 --> 38:34.511
Sylvester:
Okay.
We got keeler.

38:34.513 --> 38:36.079
He's going away.

38:36.081 --> 38:37.714
Maybe merrick'll
back off a bit now.

38:37.716 --> 38:40.317
Cabe...
What about, um...

38:40.319 --> 38:42.352
Your doubts?

38:44.588 --> 38:46.856
I want this
to work.

38:48.426 --> 38:50.393
I need it to work.

38:50.395 --> 38:53.530
I wasn't promoted
to los angeles.

38:53.532 --> 38:55.932
I flamed out in new york,
after the baghdad incident.

38:57.601 --> 38:59.803
The thought of 2,000
civilians dying

38:59.805 --> 39:01.504
And me carrying
the blame...

39:01.506 --> 39:04.374
I was a hair away
from forced retirement

39:04.376 --> 39:05.675
When I came up
with the idea

39:05.677 --> 39:07.744
To try to make
cases with you.

39:09.780 --> 39:11.514
So you thought
that we would be

39:11.516 --> 39:13.350
The jolt that <i>your</i> career needs?

39:13.352 --> 39:16.386
I want some blood
off my ledger.

39:16.388 --> 39:18.455
So even though you
may not trust me,

39:18.457 --> 39:21.124
You should know

39:21.126 --> 39:24.627
That I trust you so much

39:24.629 --> 39:27.364
That I've put everything
into this team and you.

39:32.937 --> 39:34.003
(door opens)

39:38.409 --> 39:40.110
How would a normal person
react to what he just said?

39:40.112 --> 39:43.113
(laughs)

39:43.115 --> 39:45.382
Say "thanks,"

39:45.384 --> 39:46.583
And you appreciate it.

39:49.587 --> 39:51.721
Maybe next time.

39:51.723 --> 39:54.157
My glucose level is plummeting.

39:54.159 --> 39:56.459
I just called for
a transport for keeler.

39:56.461 --> 39:59.396
We'll stop and get you a burger
on the way to homeland, hero.

39:59.398 --> 40:01.431
We'll all get food.

40:01.433 --> 40:02.932
Paige:
I can't.

40:02.934 --> 40:05.769
I've got to pick up
ralph from aftercare.

40:05.771 --> 40:07.837
Well, we'll all go.

40:09.006 --> 40:10.640
(children laughing, shouting)

40:10.642 --> 40:11.641
How was your day?

40:11.643 --> 40:12.709
Okay.

40:25.022 --> 40:26.022
Walter:
Hey, ralph.

40:26.024 --> 40:28.792
So... What kind of punch

40:28.794 --> 40:30.560
Does a jellyfish like?

40:30.562 --> 40:32.896
Because a group
of them is called

40:32.898 --> 40:34.197
A "smack" of jellyfish.

40:34.199 --> 40:37.467
You know a bunch of
turtles is a "bale"?

40:37.469 --> 40:38.802
Don't ever bet on them.

40:38.804 --> 40:40.670
Hippos hang out
in a "bloat."

40:40.672 --> 40:43.606
A pride of lions
and a parliament of owls.

40:43.608 --> 40:45.041
Army of ants.

40:45.043 --> 40:46.543
You know, um...

40:46.545 --> 40:48.978
What a family of
scorpions is called?

40:48.980 --> 40:50.814
A cyclone.

40:50.816 --> 40:54.050
Now, scorpions are very loyal
to their cyclone.

40:54.052 --> 40:55.652
But if one of them
is attacked,

40:55.654 --> 40:57.787
All the others
dive in.

40:57.789 --> 40:59.456
And we, all of us,

40:59.458 --> 41:01.491
We're a cyclone.

41:01.493 --> 41:02.492
Toby:
This cyclone is hungry.

41:02.494 --> 41:04.494
Let's get some food!

41:04.496 --> 41:06.162
You know, eventually,

41:06.164 --> 41:08.731
Uh, everyone fits in.

41:08.733 --> 41:11.167
â™ª

41:13.103 --> 41:15.505
â™ª here I am

41:15.507 --> 41:16.606
Toby:
<i>Ralph! This is our theme song!</i>

41:16.608 --> 41:18.074
â™ª rock you like a hurricane!

41:18.076 --> 41:19.142
