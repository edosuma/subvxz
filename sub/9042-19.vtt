02:42.067 --> 02:43.667
- THEY'RE GONNA SLEEP OUTSIDE?

02:43.667 --> 02:44.767
- NO!

02:44.767 --> 02:46.500
I PROMISED THEM THEY COULD
SET UP THE TENT

02:46.500 --> 02:49.200
IN THE LIVING ROOM
AND PRETEND IT'S A SLEEP-OUT.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.067
- DADDY, WHY DON'T YOU HELP US?

02:51.067 --> 02:52.767
- EH, I DON'T KNOW, ALLY.

02:52.767 --> 02:54.533
- SEE, THAT'S RIGHT.

02:54.533 --> 02:58.000
IF I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT,

02:58.000 --> 02:59.733
[chuckling]

02:59.733 --> 03:01.800

03:03.933 --> 03:06.133
- THANKS, DAD!

03:06.133 --> 03:07.667

NEED YOUR HELP.

03:07.667 --> 03:10.333
I'VE GOT THE INSTRUCTIONS

03:13.100 --> 03:14.300
I HATE THIS THING.

03:14.300 --> 03:16.167
I TOLD SAM NOT TO BUY IT.

03:16.167 --> 03:17.567

I WONDER--

03:31.267 --> 03:34.533
I WONDER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
IF YOU OPENED IT

03:34.533 --> 03:37.833

I WENT TO THE DRUGSTORE AND...

05:46.233 --> 05:50.067

05:50.067 --> 05:52.333
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

05:52.333 --> 05:54.000

05:56.200 --> 05:58.400
YOU KNOW, ON YOUR BOTTOM?

06:06.133 --> 06:07.767
- WHAT DRUGSTORE DID YOU GO TO?

06:09.867 --> 06:12.967
- NO, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN
AT THE DRUGSTORE.

06:12.967 --> 06:16.167
I DROVE ALLY TO A FRIEND'S
HOUSE, AND IT WAS THE MOM.

06:16.167 --> 06:19.267

I'M BEING TOUCHED

06:32.633 --> 06:35.400
IN AN IMPURE MANNER.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.767
- WELL, WAS IT A PAT
OR A SQUEEZE?

06:37.767 --> 06:39.467
- I'M NOT SURE.

06:39.467 --> 06:42.333
- WELL, WAS THERE GRASPING
OR CUPPING OF ANY KIND?

06:45.000 --> 06:46.767

06:57.933 --> 06:59.400
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK,

06:59.400 --> 07:02.033
I GUESS I WAS STANDING

07:02.033 --> 07:05.067
AND I WAS REACHING

07:34.767 --> 07:38.733

07:41.367 --> 07:43.167
YOU KNOW, "LET ME TIE

07:43.167 --> 07:44.500
AND SHE DID THIS.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.300
- OH, SO SHE JUST PATTED IT?

07:49.300 --> 07:51.167

11:06.300 --> 11:07.500
LISTEN, I'M SORRY.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.800
ALLY SAYS SHE'S FINE NOW.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.333
I THINK THE GIRLS
HAD A LITTLE FIGHT,

11:10.333 --> 11:13.633
BUT I GUESS
THEY GOT OVER IT.

11:13.633 --> 11:16.500
- HOW ABOUT THAT?

11:16.500 --> 11:17.700
- KIDS.

11:17.700 --> 11:20.233
- YEAH, KIDS.

11:20.233 --> 11:22.333
- WELL, IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT ALLY'S OKAY,

11:22.333 --> 11:24.100
YOU COULD COME IN--
- NO!

11:24.100 --> 11:25.433
NO, THANK YOU.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.300
NO!

11:43.300 --> 11:45.167
OH, PLEASE, GOD, NO!

11:50.633 --> 11:52.867
NO!

11:52.867 --> 11:54.933
NO!
NO!

11:54.933 --> 11:56.267
NO, NO!

12:22.000 --> 12:23.333
[doorbell rings]

12:31.000 --> 12:33.200
I, UH...

12:33.200 --> 12:36.033
I'M HAVING
A LITTLE CAR TROUBLE.

12:36.033 --> 12:37.933
COULD I JUST USE YOUR PHONE?

12:37.933 --> 12:39.267
- SURE, COME IN.

12:54.167 --> 12:55.533
- GIRLS ARE IN THE TENT?

12:55.533 --> 12:57.433
- NO, THEY DECIDED
THEY WANTED TO SLEEP

12:57.433 --> 13:00.033
IN THE SOFA-BED DOWNSTAIRS
IN THE BASEMENT.

13:00.033 --> 13:01.433
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT,

13:01.433 --> 13:05.000
AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE
SETTING THIS THING UP?

13:05.000 --> 13:06.333
THERE'S A PHONE RIGHT HERE.

13:15.267 --> 13:16.467
- HEY, ROBERT, IT'S ME.

13:16.467 --> 13:18.033
LISTEN, I LOCKED MY KEYS
IN THE CAR.

13:18.033 --> 13:20.267
YOU GUYS GOT TO COME
AND PICK ME UP.

13:20.267 --> 13:21.667
YEAH, HA HA HA, VERY FUNNY!

13:21.667 --> 13:22.867
VERY FUNNY.

13:22.867 --> 13:25.700
JUST COME AND GET ME!

13:25.700 --> 13:26.867
NO, NOW!

13:26.867 --> 13:29.200
I CAN'T WAIT
TILL THE END OF THE GAME!

13:29.200 --> 13:31.567
WELL, CALL DAD UP
AND TELL HIM TO GET ME, THEN.

13:31.567 --> 13:33.233
ROBERT.
ROBERT!

13:33.233 --> 13:34.667
OH, I'M GONNA KILL YOU!

13:34.667 --> 13:36.000
AHH!

13:37.567 --> 13:39.733
- THOUGHT YOU MIGHT NEED THIS.
- WHAT?

13:39.733 --> 13:40.967
- YOU'RE ALL WET.

13:40.967 --> 13:44.267
- OH. THANK YOU.

13:44.267 --> 13:46.700
- WOULD YOU LIKE
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

13:46.700 --> 13:48.167
I'VE GOT TEA.

13:48.167 --> 13:49.533
- NO, NO, I'M GOOD.

13:49.533 --> 13:51.500
MY DAD'S GONNA COME GET ME SOON.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.267
- ALL RIGHT,
THEN LET ME TAKE YOUR COAT.

13:56.267 --> 13:57.933
- OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'LL JUST LEAVE THIS ON.

13:57.933 --> 14:00.033
- NO, COME ON, YOU'RE DRIPPING
ALL OVER MY CARPET.

14:00.033 --> 14:01.300
- I'LL DRY IT OFF, THEN.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.600
- COME ON,
I'LL JUST HANG IT UP.

14:03.600 --> 14:05.067
[both yelling at once]

14:05.067 --> 14:06.767
WOULD YOU PLEASE--
- NO!

14:06.767 --> 14:07.967
- WHAT?

14:07.967 --> 14:09.300
- STOP IT!
NO!

14:10.967 --> 14:13.100
MY GOD!

14:13.100 --> 14:14.500
DON'T YOU GET IT?

14:14.500 --> 14:15.633
NO MEANS NO!

14:20.933 --> 14:22.867
- WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

14:22.867 --> 14:26.400
- DON'T THINK I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.500
THE FIRE, THE DRINKS,

14:28.500 --> 14:29.633
THE RAIN.

14:32.367 --> 14:33.600
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

14:33.600 --> 14:37.167
- YOU TOUCHED ME
ON MY PERSONAL SPACE.

14:37.167 --> 14:39.167
I WAS JUST BENDING OVER
TO FIX YOUR TENT.

14:39.167 --> 14:42.700
I WAS NOT PRESENTING.

14:42.700 --> 14:44.600
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING--

14:44.600 --> 14:45.800
OH, WHEN I DID THIS?

14:45.800 --> 14:47.733
- WATCH IT, LADY!

14:47.733 --> 14:49.267
- WHAT WAS THE BIG DEAL?

14:49.267 --> 14:51.133
- THE BIG DEAL IS
THAT I'M A MARRIED MAN,

14:51.133 --> 14:56.467
AND YOU HAD A PICNIC
IN MYBACKYARD!

14:56.467 --> 14:58.100
- [laughs]

14:58.100 --> 15:01.467
YOU THINK I WAS
COMING ON TO YOU?

15:01.467 --> 15:03.233
[laughs]

15:03.233 --> 15:05.267
IN YOUR DREAMS, PAL.

15:05.267 --> 15:07.933
- NO, IN YOURDREAMS!

15:07.933 --> 15:09.233
OKAY?

15:09.233 --> 15:11.233
WHY ELSE WOULD YOU
GO AT ME LIKE THAT?

15:11.233 --> 15:13.633
- OH, BECAUSE I AM
SOATTRACTED TO YOU,

15:13.633 --> 15:16.033
CAPTAIN FLAT PANTS!

15:17.567 --> 15:18.967
- YEAH, THEN WHY'D YOU DO IT?

15:18.967 --> 15:20.667
- I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST DID IT.

15:20.667 --> 15:21.800
- OH, YEAH, YEAH.

15:21.800 --> 15:23.833
THAT'S JUST YOUR
LITTLE THANK-YOU GIFT

15:23.833 --> 15:25.267
FOR ANYBODY WHO HELPS YOU OUT.

15:25.267 --> 15:27.733
- HEY, I TOLD YOU
I DIDN'T NEED YOUR HELP.

15:27.733 --> 15:29.933
YOU JUST HAD TO SHOW ME
WHAT A BIG, STRONG MAN YOU WERE.

15:29.933 --> 15:32.167
LIKE I COULDN'T HAVE FIGURED OUT
THAT TENT ON MY OWN?

15:32.167 --> 15:33.800
- I WASN'T TRYING
TO SHOW YOU ANYTHING.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.000
I WAS DOING IT FOR THE KIDS.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.333
- OH, PLEASE, GIVE ME A BREAK.

15:36.333 --> 15:38.367
YOU WERE STRUTTING AROUND,
GLOATING.

15:38.367 --> 15:41.500
"MAYBE I SHOULD
GET A MERIT BADGE."

15:41.500 --> 15:43.533
YOU'RE LUCKY
I DIDN'T KICKYOUR BUTT!

15:48.367 --> 15:49.967
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
YOU SCARED?

15:49.967 --> 15:51.867
- NO!

15:51.867 --> 15:53.200
YES!

15:55.033 --> 15:56.233
ALL RIGHT, I'LL ADMIT IT.

15:56.233 --> 15:58.233
YOU SCARE ME.
YOU'RE SCARY.

15:58.233 --> 16:00.133
YOU'RE A BAD, SCARY LADY.

16:06.267 --> 16:08.467
SO LET'S JUST AGREE
THAT YOU DON'T TOUCH ME,

16:08.467 --> 16:10.667
AND I WILL WAIT
FOR MY RIDE OUTSIDE.

16:10.667 --> 16:11.867
- FINE, YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:11.867 --> 16:13.467
GET OUT!
JUST GET OUT NOW!

16:13.467 --> 16:14.600
GET OUT NOW!

16:20.667 --> 16:21.700
WOULD YOU GO?

16:21.700 --> 16:24.033
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?
I SAID GET OUT!

16:24.033 --> 16:25.367
- ALL RIGHT.

16:35.067 --> 16:36.900
WHAT ARE YOU CRYING ABOUT?

16:36.900 --> 16:38.733
- I AM NOTCRYING.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.867
- OH, OKAY.

16:43.867 --> 16:45.800
LISTEN.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.100
I DIDN'T MEAN TO--

16:47.100 --> 16:48.333
- DIDN'T MEAN TO WHAT?

16:48.333 --> 16:50.133
CALL ME A SCARY,
MEAN, OLD ASS-GRABBER?

16:54.333 --> 16:57.933
- I DID NOT SAY "ASS."

16:57.933 --> 16:59.133
- LOOK, I'M SORRY.

16:59.133 --> 17:01.067
I DON'T KNOW WHY I DID IT.

17:02.533 --> 17:04.567
IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE
THAT'S WHAT MY HUSBAND

17:04.567 --> 17:06.000
USED TO DO TO ME.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.667
LIKE, "OH, YEAH,
GOOD JOB, TOOTS.

17:07.667 --> 17:09.533
"DIDN'T THINK YOU COULD MANAGE
GETTING THE FORK

17:09.533 --> 17:11.833
OUT OF THE DISHWASHER
AND MAKE A POT OF COFFEE."

17:11.833 --> 17:13.167
CONDESCENDING LITTLE PUTZ!

17:16.400 --> 17:17.967
- NO, NO.
NO, IT WAS ME.

17:17.967 --> 17:20.233
IT WAS ALL MY PERSONALITY.

17:20.233 --> 17:21.700
I'M SO TOUGH TO GET ALONG WITH.

17:21.700 --> 17:22.967
I'M SO NEGATIVE.

17:22.967 --> 17:25.067
HOW DOES HE THINK I GOT SO--

17:25.067 --> 17:27.600
HOW DO YOU THINK
I GOT THIS WAY?

17:27.600 --> 17:28.733
- I DON'T KNOW.

17:30.933 --> 17:32.367
SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS HIS FAULT.

17:37.700 --> 17:40.433
- LOOK, I AM
NO WALK IN THE PARK,

17:40.433 --> 17:43.700
BUT, I MEAN, WHENEVER
I TRIED TO TALK TO HIM,

17:43.700 --> 17:47.233
ALL HE WANTED TO DO
WAS WATCH TELEVISION.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.667
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
HE WANTED SEX,

17:49.667 --> 17:50.800
AND THEN, WHEW, BOY,

17:50.800 --> 17:54.600
FOR THOSE EIGHT MINUTES,
I WAS NUMBER ONE.

17:56.067 --> 18:01.033
- YEAH, WELL, I MEAN, SOME GUYS.

18:01.033 --> 18:03.700
EIGHT MINUTES.

18:03.700 --> 18:05.033
THAT'S BAD, RIGHT?

18:09.633 --> 18:11.700
- AND HE LIED,
I MEAN, ALL THE TIME

18:11.700 --> 18:14.167
ABOUT EVERYTHING,
EVEN LITTLE THINGS.

18:14.167 --> 18:17.133
HE'D JUST SAY
WHATEVER I WANTED TO HEAR

18:17.133 --> 18:18.467
TO AVOID CONFRONTATION.

18:22.633 --> 18:24.600
- HMM.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.167
- HE NEVER LISTENED,

18:26.167 --> 18:28.300
NEVER HELPED ME,

18:28.300 --> 18:31.233
ONLY CARED ABOUT HIMSELF.

18:31.233 --> 18:33.767
12 YEARS OF MARRIAGE.

18:33.767 --> 18:35.100
- WOW, 12 YEARS?

18:37.200 --> 18:38.600
AND HE JUST LEFT?

18:38.600 --> 18:39.800
- NO.

18:39.800 --> 18:41.533
I THREW HIM OUT.

18:41.533 --> 18:42.667
- OH.

18:44.567 --> 18:45.700
OHH.

18:47.800 --> 18:49.167
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

18:49.167 --> 18:51.333
- NO, NOTHING, I JUST--

18:51.333 --> 18:52.800
JUST WONDERING...

18:52.800 --> 18:55.100
WONDERING WHERE MY DAD IS.

18:55.100 --> 18:56.867
I SHOULD BE GETTING HOME.

18:56.867 --> 18:58.767
DEBRA'S...

18:58.767 --> 19:01.500
SHE'S A LITTLE SICK.

19:01.500 --> 19:05.333
- WELL, I'VE GOT
TO TAKE THIS TENT DOWN.

19:05.333 --> 19:06.800
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET ME HELP YOU.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.600
- OH, WELL, THANKS.

19:08.600 --> 19:11.067
WE SHOULD PROBABLY GET
THE SLEEPING BAGS OUT FIRST.

19:11.067 --> 19:12.400
- OH, OKAY.

19:15.567 --> 19:16.933
[knocking on door]

19:16.933 --> 19:18.267
- HELLO.

19:21.367 --> 19:22.533
- HELLO.

19:22.533 --> 19:25.733
- MY HUSBAND SAID THAT
RAYMOND NEEDED A RIDE--

19:25.733 --> 19:27.600
OH!

19:27.600 --> 19:28.900
OH, MY GOD!

19:28.900 --> 19:30.100
- NO, MOM!

19:30.100 --> 19:31.500
- OH, MY GOD!

19:31.500 --> 19:32.833
- MOM!

19:32.833 --> 19:34.167
MOM!

19:38.667 --> 19:40.100
SORRY.

19:40.100 --> 19:41.533
SHE'S A LITTLE SICK TOO.

19:43.067 --> 19:44.667
MOM!

19:49.000 --> 19:50.400
- HEY.

19:50.400 --> 19:51.600
- HEY.

19:51.600 --> 19:52.600
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

19:52.600 --> 19:54.133
- STUFF TO MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER.

19:54.133 --> 19:56.167
YOU'RE SICK.
I'M TAKING CARE OF YOU.

19:56.167 --> 19:57.367
FIRST OF ALL, COUGH SYRUP.

19:57.367 --> 19:59.000
I GOT ALL THE SLEEPY KIND.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.433
NIGHTTIME,
P.M.--

20:01.433 --> 20:04.400
THIS JUST HAS
A BUNCH OF "Z"s ON IT.

20:04.400 --> 20:05.600
- WOW.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.700
- GOT YOU LOZENGES,

20:07.700 --> 20:09.000
VITAMIN C,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.667
AND I GOT YOU
A VAPORIZER.

20:11.667 --> 20:14.133
I THOUGHT IT'D BE BETTER THAN ME
RUBBING ALL THAT STUFF ON YOU.

20:14.133 --> 20:16.067
YOU DON'T NEED THAT.

20:16.067 --> 20:19.233
- I THINK I HAVE A FEVER,
'CAUSE I'M HALLUCINATING.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.133
- WHAT?

20:22.133 --> 20:24.100
I'M YOUR HUSBAND.

20:24.100 --> 20:25.500
I LISTEN.

20:25.500 --> 20:26.700
I HELP.

20:26.700 --> 20:28.367
I'M HERE.

20:28.367 --> 20:30.300
THAT'S WHAT WE GOT GOING.

20:30.300 --> 20:32.733
12 YEARS AND NO END IN SIGHT.

20:35.367 --> 20:38.000
RIGHT?

20:38.000 --> 20:39.333
OH, I GOT TO GO.

20:39.333 --> 20:41.533
I GOT CHICKEN SOUP
ON THE STOVE FOR YOU.

20:48.733 --> 20:50.333
- MAYBE I DIED.

20:55.167 --> 20:56.867
- YOU SHOULD NEVER
HAVE ALLOWED YOURSELF

20:56.867 --> 20:58.267
TO BE IN THAT POSITION.

20:58.267 --> 21:00.633
- MOM, SHE WASN'T GONNA
DO ANYTHING, ALL RIGHT?

21:00.633 --> 21:02.600
I WAS JUST HELPING HER
TAKE DOWN THE TENT.

21:02.600 --> 21:04.600
- A WOMAN DOESN'T
GET A MAN INTO A TENT

21:04.600 --> 21:06.467
UNLESS SHE'S
GOING IN AFTER HIM.

21:09.767 --> 21:11.367
- LISTEN,

21:11.367 --> 21:14.367
PEGGY IS NOT
ATTRACTED TO ME AT ALL.

21:14.367 --> 21:16.767
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

21:16.767 --> 21:18.267
I'M TELLING YOU,

21:18.267 --> 21:20.033
THE THINGS YOU DO
AND THE WAY YOU LOOK

21:20.033 --> 21:21.567
CAN DRIVE A WOMAN CRAZY.

21:21.567 --> 21:24.000
- AH, MA, PLEASE.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.900
- LIKE YOUR SHY LITTLE SMILE...

21:25.900 --> 21:27.367
- ALL RIGHT. THAT'S ENOUGH!

21:27.367 --> 21:29.133
- AND YOUR SENSITIVE EYES.

21:29.133 --> 21:30.700
- MA, I'M EATING HERE!

21:30.700 --> 21:32.967
- AND LET'S NOT FORGET
THOSE TIGHT PANTS--

21:32.967 --> 21:34.367
- AHH!

21:34.367 --> 21:35.500
MA!

21:41.033 --> 21:42.533
- HE WON'T DO THAT AGAIN.
